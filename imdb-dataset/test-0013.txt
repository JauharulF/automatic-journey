<START> i saw this film in a cinema club in germany in 1970 most of the <UNK> were from the local private school at which i was teaching i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france and though they hadn't been my favorites i could at least make sense of them being able to speak french helped br br the fairly <UNK> beginning of le week end soon turned into a <UNK> of images very well maybe too well photographed that soon made no sense to me for me films like books must have some clear sort of meaning this didn't for me i suppose i'm not into artsy films images still haunt me from the film to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat well loved by the french those who've seen the film might realize why yes the theme of <UNK> came through but the <UNK> the car <UNK> and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only <UNK> me i'm not sure if i walked out before the end but i certainly felt like it i promised myself that i'd never watch another godard film and i haven't and never <UNK> will br br my rating nothing it was the most disgusting film i've ever seen others may have been more inept silly or stupid i've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever
<START> as far as fake documentaries go anyone this one is up there with the best it looks very real and that is what it aims for in recent light of events <UNK> this movie is even scarier so you could say it was ahead of it's time when it was released in the 70s br br one can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist looking for terrorists and <UNK> people just like that of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same 70s mentality screw the politicians and politics in general maybe that wasn't so clever one might think but hey don't forget it's only a movie o
<START> if it had not been for christopher <UNK> hilarious role i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes the jokes were flat the movie choppy and slow paced certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch but <UNK> character kept me laughing so i stuck with it br br i do feel there are much better choices out there
<START> this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975 i was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive in theatre i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie after seeing it on the television along with two of my other favourite movies car wash my favourite movie and the <UNK> which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together about 40 50 75 times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child br br i would not consider this to be a <UNK> movie but rather an urban interest movie and <UNK> reminded me of some of my <UNK> especially the wild irish rose that they <UNK> my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now i'm glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era
<START> conventional and superficial portrayal was <UNK> it is supposed that just a few moments with sheila makes him win her love but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence <UNK> i <UNK> know why it was given a pg rating br br
<START> nothing carson <UNK> has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh or even smile a little i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years br br even the funny band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him <UNK> and that dude are just arrogant frat boys it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny br br awful awful awful show br br it makes my soul cry br br i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is don't watch it but if you absolutely have to i recommend <UNK> your eyes out and <UNK> your ears with <UNK> beforehand
<START> one day i thought to myself what is the worst possible thing that could happen today i answered my self with a simple oh it already happened i rented <UNK> <UNK> 2 on dvd well what is there to say the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes there is one funny line that i can remember and the acting is far worse than the first one there seems to be no lighting on the set the woods somewhere and the killer clown known as <UNK> who makes <UNK> look like the exorcist is less than spectacular this time he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says child a lot somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass lies this version of <UNK> somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s t lies <UNK> 2 it's badness is underrated this movie does not have any redeeming qualities except the song at the very end over the credits which at provides some enjoyment <UNK> 2 is not even really a movie so much as an exercise in tension <UNK> 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen minor spoiler let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort maybe an <UNK> when <UNK> peers in through a hole he has some small <UNK> teeth like the ones you can buy at <UNK> gifts and he does something with them maybe winds them up then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line which can't be written on imdb from what i gather of this scene not from what is shown by the movie the teeth went into the <UNK> and killed the girl in some interesting but way and then came back to <UNK> if i were those teeth i would have run run far from <UNK> so he could never ever get his hands on me again <UNK> 2 is hopefully the last <UNK> we will have to endure even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad i think that this film could <UNK> the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed i give it 2 10 simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move
<START> i used to work at the company that originally put out this film <UNK> pictures <UNK> had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films not that money alone will buy you a good film look at kevin <UNK> <UNK> for instance br br sometimes if you have a talented person in house doing the or development you can create your own new talent but at <UNK> there wasn't such a person and they always <UNK> in some crucial area in this case it was on the director and the writer which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie even with the great ensemble cast this film has br br i think the basic premise of this movie was let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens it's an intriguing idea but not worth your time watching br br most <UNK> films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non <UNK> films many times we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad we'd sit there watching the trailer or ad and afterwards we'd turn to each and almost in sync we'd say now that's a <UNK> movie this is a <UNK> movie
<START> comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true but even as such some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile when i look at the daily show i see the whole it's funny because it's true thing but i don't however see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point i notice this mostly in the interview segments the daily show started off as a news parody by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news <UNK> and and they <UNK> tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics then jon stewart came along and it all went to hell <UNK> first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden i though he was so funny but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on the show's humor has gone stale <UNK> left steve carell left many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi serious news show essentially evening news but with some gags here and there for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about at least until 2009 bush <UNK> and all <UNK> unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by <UNK> as well are stupid evil corrupt and <UNK> anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil corrupt and a <UNK> people who doubt the man made global warming theory are evil and stupid vote <UNK> there i saved you 25 minutes of your time go watch something else at first i though that the producers <UNK> the show for their own personal political agenda but when i actually see the interviews it becomes crystal clear what this show's about what i mentioned above but i'll get to that in a moment off the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush <UNK> or a random <UNK> humorous because well because jon sets up the joke setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline so unless you the context it's entirely useless as <UNK> humor also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand thus making it funny why well because jon said so now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares yes even in the lewis black segments at first some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes but now much less of that is apparent and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen jon stewart calls bill <UNK> a bully but what does that make him when he sucks up to every single actor and <UNK> john <UNK> before <UNK> today that appears on the show and looks down upon respected <UNK> and accomplished conservative such as weekly own bill he puts them in some sort of people's <UNK> as if they're being charged with a crime often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as <UNK> as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america that's the de <UNK> treatment for anybody conservative unless they happen to share a similar point of view with <UNK> if so it's an endless love fest but still it doesn't matter in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong <UNK> that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right wing now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor one wonders <UNK> happen if <UNK> win the white house
<START> i didn't know what to expect from this i always considered <UNK> and the crew a team of <UNK> heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment i didn't know that they could act but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances the hilarity of the ' scene mixes in with ryan <UNK> depression and his revenge against his ex girlfriend perfectly at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they're funny i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns
<START> the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog eat dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a <UNK> i've got no problem with the human side of being portrayed but <UNK> <UNK> too far in the direction of soft comical men the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who though exciting was extremely dangerous and <UNK> br br the <UNK> all good and the direction very solid the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting did <UNK> really want to kill
<START> <UNK> a life in four chapters is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with <UNK> ease it is based on the life of controversial japanese author <UNK> <UNK> who committed suicide in the 1970s it is not really a biopic at least not one in the traditional sense but an exploration of <UNK> <UNK> the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an totally engaging manner paul <UNK> makes you sympathize with <UNK> without having to <UNK> him or his work it doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it an added bonus as we see fury over the lack of tradition in a morally <UNK> modern society <UNK> gives us an excellent <UNK> of the <UNK> between thought and execution in cinema john <UNK> cinematography is spectacularly good the of composer philip <UNK> work is perfectly suited for the project <UNK> is the best film i've seen this year so far
<START> a beautiful film one that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed made me think about death but not fear it think about life but not hide from it a movie that gave both love for all i stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest <UNK> of hell a movie that made me think of love and all that i have lost but no sadness <UNK> my eyes for some strange reason relief a child of two worlds god and theater and a good bit of wine and irony i most highly recommend br br when the s hits the fan get a <UNK> oh and we should all go camping every day
<START> let's get one thing straight this was bad so <UNK> that it doesn't even qualify to be <UNK> on anyone's memories br br the ever repeating storyline who's constant <UNK> of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode <UNK> on how she loves her baby son but <UNK> awful as if that doesn't get old <UNK> de bloody <UNK> some australian quasi <UNK> look it up appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an <UNK> while everything everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercy br br the rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of <UNK> with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out br br the phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on br br it <UNK> me though to see someone as good as sally good actress i like her make a <UNK> out of herself o <UNK> my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny but not here and ben <UNK> distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this thing then comedy is in very serious trouble
<START> ingrid bergman <UNK> has never been so beautiful gary cooper as so perfectly cast as a <UNK> <UNK> who knows this gal is up to no good when the two lock eyes at the french market we know this match will be full of sparks when they <UNK> in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us <UNK> br br the costumes are lovely the set decoration makes you wish the quarter was just that way and that <UNK> still had that hotel with the wide <UNK> with all the old <UNK> br br from <UNK> novel the story is of revenge for old <UNK> and the fights over who would run the <UNK> in the early days of that industry br br in the <UNK> scenes <UNK> bates as a grand dame steals every scene br br but it is the scene of <UNK> taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment after <UNK> has <UNK> him in the <UNK> he looks at her with longing and says may i say you are very beautiful and <UNK> with a happy wicked smile says yes isn't it lucky you want to shout yes br br one of my all time favorite romantic films
<START> with <UNK> and <UNK> as the leads this film had good possibilities and with <UNK> as the bad guy after <UNK> maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening <UNK> and then later on with <UNK> war <UNK> it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and <UNK> or not the number one mistake was <UNK> <UNK> so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead <UNK> pulled at the easy and low cost <UNK> elements
<START> beautiful film set in <UNK> hong kong about a man mr <UNK> and woman mrs chan who become close friends when they suspect their <UNK> are having an affair <UNK> the film is also beautiful wong <UNK> <UNK> uses a lot of slow motion and close ups on parts of the body feet hands <UNK> the film itself has a <UNK> and <UNK> that suggests its time period it's sexy without showing everything wong <UNK> <UNK> also doesn't allow the audience to see what the <UNK> look like suggesting that mr <UNK> and mrs chan should be together smoking is even made to look elegant with close ups of the <UNK> of smoke a really lovely film just prepare yourself for the ending br br
<START> who can ask for more taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk i admit but well worth it they were enthralled from credit to credit with their parents beside them br br i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results too scary too boring too sophisticated whatever with this film however i was glad to see a smart film with wit style and a sense of passion <UNK> from the screen any film that takes 5 years of production to make good or bad deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this br br o k i'm <UNK> a little then again why wouldn't i get excited looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed at least for the moment regardless w g is a film well made perhaps the originality wasn't the most inspired nevertheless well told and well paced br br too much adult humour too many sex references maybe though my kids didn't quite catch them too young so in my case i didn't really notice br br well needless to say i liked it
<START> the only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script is the ideal showcase for joel <UNK> glorious flamboyant <UNK> lack of talent the plot is totally illogical but super fake <UNK> and everything is art directed within an inch of its life in the most clichéd <UNK> way i love how the <UNK> school <UNK> room is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> low lit in red with huge <UNK> paintings hanging from the walls i love how <UNK> sutherland drives a <UNK> backed army <UNK> no one in joel <UNK> movies lives in an un eccentric manner it's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip but hip strictly and <UNK> according to an out of touch middle aged <UNK> man child's idea of hip and holy crap the part where baldwin brother 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he's slept with who i'll call you and i just need some space is the funniest <UNK> thing in the whole universe what kind of a world do we live in where joel <UNK> gets to keep having people throw money at him made me want to review the man's entire <UNK> solely for the kind of high quality <UNK> contained <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed <UNK>  a cool and fast story which didn't get <UNK> down in detail those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time the high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot br br <UNK> show that the german film industry is capable of <UNK> successful hollywood concepts with local into our cinemas
<START> not well done at all the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed like the 3 school girls for example br br the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge br br did not impress me at all i was not scared i didn't jump at any parts and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of makes the 1 look like crap also which was actually an alright movie br br i believe that the grudge 2 is like a leading movie to the grudge 3 if they ever make one they shouldn't have even called this the grudge 2 they should of called it the prologue to the grudge 2 and you will see if you watched it because i am not going to spoil anything not that it would have <UNK> anyway br br 1 10 not scary bad story and is just completely random
<START> this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it such a smart comedy very precise yet easy the casting can not be any better all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly the greatest of all is when the village people's <UNK> is <UNK> in it brings out the importance of the <UNK> which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the <UNK> and funniest climax among many comedies i give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated
<START> i first heard about the melancholy of from a reviewer on youtube he literally slapped the show with a big bad rant <UNK> it rubbish and confusing curious i decided to watch the show once i got the order of the episodes right thanks to those who made the lists and i found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious a unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that i've watched the show and two of the best anime moments in history in my opinion plus the opening and ending themes are great br br the anime based on a collection of successful manga novels follows a simple plot once you understand it while the show's focus is on the main character the point of view is from her friend is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural stuff e g santa <UNK> aliens time <UNK> ghosts but he soon ends up talking to who is the most <UNK> girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien considering all men worthless she even joined every club in the school to find something interesting but quit as quickly as she joined upon advice from decides to form her own club with club setting up in the literary club room forms the <UNK> <UNK> its mission to investigate supernatural cases think scooby doo minus the dog the masked man and the mystery machine br br <UNK> three extra members the first is <UNK> a <UNK> of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting the second is a shy girl who is forced into the club by who thinks they need a cute <UNK> to get some things done she is often forced into costumes by to further her <UNK> the third is a friendly and <UNK> transfer student who is always smiling while thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldn't be more wrong while is as normal as you can get the other three on the other hand are rather unique <UNK> is an alien is a time <UNK> from the future and is an a person who has <UNK> all three have come to watch over who may just have the powers of a god and if she becomes bored she may be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world and is involved somehow br br the show is worth watching with great characters music and some hilarious and wonderful moments however for parents there is some sexual references including <UNK> being exposed or touched several times and several swear words used as well apart from that the show is one of the <UNK>
<START> i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight midnight cowboy coming home has ever done but a real tribute to teachers br br despite incredible odds pat <UNK> voight managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic <UNK> and awareness of the world his methods made be criticized by <UNK> dinosaurs like mr <UNK> <UNK> but teachers like <UNK> will always be winners br br voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him he didn't <UNK> the role and i found him to be totally believable voight is br br besides a love of teaching we also see another important point in this film no matter how good you are at your job if you rock the boat the <UNK> will get you
<START> i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in <UNK> al which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot a school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together it's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality story <UNK> from real life <UNK> ripped straight from the <UNK> raw blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end the film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity definitely not suitable for kids too depressing for some people's tastes definitely worth checking out in my opinion though
<START> oh my god that has got to be one of the most useless brainless stupidest comedy ever made what has happened to even money money was worth watching br br <UNK> god this movie stinks br br do not watch it save your money bad movie bad cast bad jokes bad acting even this movie is an example of shoe polish being <UNK> on a face br br trust me this movie does even make you smile vulgar jokes cheap jokes a really stupid movie with no concepts br br rating 0 on 10 br br awful movie those are the two hours im never getting back br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> good old jess franco the always reliable choice of director in case you're looking for <UNK> sleaze shameless exploitation and 200 jess once again really <UNK> himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle adventure let's face it this film is basically just an excuse to have the <UNK> hot and actress <UNK> parade around topless it's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16 year old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the <UNK> eyes of <UNK> franco and it wasn't even the first time since the duo previously already made linda together anyways just in case you wondered yes <UNK> of the does have a plot albeit a very <UNK> one during the opening sequences a plane carrying aboard a wealthy scottish guy and a girl child crash amidst an african tribe of <UNK> cannibals i say <UNK> because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to <UNK> human flesh the obnoxious <UNK> declares himself the great white leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and <UNK> dressed white <UNK> several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly to steal some of the <UNK> legendary <UNK> this could have been a compelling and action packed adventure movie but jess franco obviously couldn't be bothered why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody <UNK> <UNK> when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone's garden and there's a massive amount of clumsily edited national <UNK> <UNK> footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity the back of the dvd describes <UNK> of the as an ingenious feminist and adult <UNK> version of tarzan yeah right they just put that sentence there because <UNK> character <UNK> from one tree to another using a a couple of times
<START> solo starts as a team of us soldiers go into america to blow up a rebel <UNK> joining them is a robot named solo mario van <UNK> who can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger ten times faster than any human being something goes wrong though solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which colonel frank <UNK> william <UNK> isn't happy about back at base general <UNK> barry corbin orders solo to be shut down one of <UNK> main <UNK> is self <UNK> so decides to escape back into the south american <UNK> where colonel <UNK> his men are sent in to <UNK> it br br this mexican american co production was directed by one has to say solo is awful the script by david <UNK> was based on the novel by robert mason is one cliché after another robots were popular at the time solo was made in hollywood at the box office so solo rip offs the likes of <UNK> 1987 universal soldier 1992 the two terminator flicks as well as having the same setting basic story as predator 1987 this is the usual rubbish about an <UNK> robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions starts to <UNK> people sounds like terminator 2 judgment day 1991 to me the character's are poor colonel <UNK> in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating solo at all why he would kill other us soldiers <UNK> orders to destroy it you know i saw this on cable telly last night for free thank god i didn't spend any money on it i looked it up in the tv guide do you know what it said my tv guide described solo as a sci fi action starring mario van which when i think about it is a perfect description of solo in less than ten words my tv guide has hit the nail on the head i mean it's a sci fi action film it certainly stars mario van <UNK> it's definitely dire enough said really br br director doesn't do anything particularly special here the action scenes lack any real excitement the sci fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact solo is a robot so the military lose solo colonel <UNK> is sent in to <UNK> it right i'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a <UNK> <UNK> inside solo in case something like that happened surely at the very least solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time i'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self <UNK> device might be useful if anything went wrong the violence is mild there are a few ok fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really br br technically the film looks alright is competently made it was actually shot in mexico the makers of the dolph lundgren action flick agent red 2000 edited footage from solo into that film the acting is poor van <UNK> was the perfect choice to play an <UNK> robot william <UNK> deserves better than this it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic die hard 2 die harder 1990 br br solo is a really bad sci fi action flick which is basically a huge rip off of big budget hollywood sci fi action films like <UNK> universal soldier the terminator films not recommend i'm going to start pay more attention to my tv guide when it comes to choosing films to watch
<START> for all those people who believe the dialog is worth something and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously this movie will surprise you it is not a for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero professor <UNK> <UNK> dennis quaid br br <UNK> teaches in southern california near the <UNK> <UNK> he has not published a novel in four years his wife is <UNK> him he drinks a bit much and is blessed or cursed with <UNK> wit which he <UNK> <UNK> to his students he has recommended a friend for <UNK> and one bright young student has <UNK> a <UNK> to him as an independent project <UNK> doesn't even want to read it so gives it an a and pushes it to the side <UNK> back with a drink in his office he stares out the window when the bright young student falls past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a <UNK> encounter br br hal comes to talk and they chat drinking some more the <UNK> realizes that he has to read the <UNK> now when he goes home his wife is waiting with divorce papers he drinks some more she leaves and he goes to a <UNK> affair only to find her there he drinks even more and when his wife learns that the student is dead she <UNK> and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student this of course <UNK> him to do some more serious drinking the next morning he wakes up to find himself in the <UNK> room of one of his students a <UNK> named <UNK> meg ryan br br he feels worse than a <UNK> goes to the doctor and learns that he has been <UNK> it is <UNK> and he has 24 48 hours to live he doesn't have much time to find out who killed him and there are sub plots motives relationships and surprises at every turn although everything makes sense at the end all his <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> with sarcasm dry wit and keen observations let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> br br there are no bad performances in this movie there are <UNK> images and symbolism used at careful <UNK> watch for the <UNK> glass and images distorted through glass some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988 and some of the violent action is carefully and <UNK> choreographed the music is <UNK> and appropriate although occasionally it makes it's own statement in song lyrics the visuals in this flick are impressive br br if there are any failures it is that the opening 20 minutes move a little slow and nearly puts you to sleep but the pacing picks up quickly with just the right amount of exposition in between action segments br br there are no explicit sexual encounters although there is violence and some bad language br br this is a writer's movie and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure i do think if you take it seriously you're already in big trouble
<START> i wish i could have given this a zero sure i'll admit that i also <UNK> picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version a clever marketing <UNK> releasing it at this time and being <UNK> displayed at the video store however i was willing to give it a go anyhow i wish i wouldn't have br br where do i start i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good sorry even c thomas <UNK> <UNK> none of the performances were any good not a one br br even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible and dick <UNK> just doesn't really cut it br br now as for the story well it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope what the hell is that when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night or worse yet <UNK> of the next day i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice what the hell the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs how could they miss it there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face the special effects in general are terrible the entire movie is like a bad train wreck when we finally get to the end after this guy trying to get to <UNK> to find his family they just appear no searching no asking questions nothing just oh there you are i am so happy the end br br i am sorry if my review <UNK> a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard <UNK> my contempt please save yourself the time and don't watch this <UNK> displayed pile of cinematic <UNK> it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed i would rather have been getting a root <UNK> it would have been less painful
<START> for an <UNK> film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 but in general it only gets a 3 the effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of <UNK> low budget horror films do the acting is very wooden but at least they had a better display than some films in the <UNK> budget category it's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement the plot as a whole isn't the worst it's a resident evil rip off about an evil corporation <UNK> a small town and an <UNK> makes people into zombies i would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another super zombie i try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned spoiler alert not only do some of the cast just seem to <UNK> past the zombies the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them but one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me the deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil <UNK> <UNK> he kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess the deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up meaning kill all the surviving witnesses no problem but then 2 seconds later he is helping them out there was no real change of heart emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their <UNK> there was no incident or anything to make me buy into this worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks otherwise you will not enjoy this
<START> i didn't like this movie for so many reasons i can't even say then all i thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the and it broke loose on a cruise liner lame it was all right for a lame straight to video movie but not worth spending money on it i can't believe someone actually gave this movie a ten but i guess there are people that like this movie i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the and it had the guy off of lord of the rings if you want to see this movie i would stay home and wait till it comes on sci fi channel don't waste your money on seeing this movie believe me
<START> one of his lesser known films many horror fans have yet to catch this <UNK> <UNK> offering which is unfortunate it is <UNK> mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it the film boasts grade a <UNK> gore with his <UNK> close ups set to savage rock scores while it true that this script is not very complex it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre or his own personal resume for that matter br br this movie <UNK> more of the that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission worth a good look on any night
<START> i don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably every time several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year perhaps decade i mean when i say the cg looks like daytime tv i'm giving daytime tv a bad name i've seen better stuff on the sci fi channel who i really feel sorry for is the actors that they have their names attached to this film they did a good job i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the <UNK> whats really amusing is the <UNK> of some of the sets if you have seen exorcist the beginning it will be easy to spot the <UNK> of some of the buildings however what i thought was the worst thing about this film even above the cg problems was the main demon he was just not scary in anyway his form the way he talked he was extremely bland all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end
<START> when you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the <UNK> <UNK> about obviously your expectations are high right f k yeah but when this baby dropped through my door little did i know what f ed up visuals would grace my tv and <UNK> my fragile mind first off <UNK> is a film fan like all of us growing up on a <UNK> of <UNK> fulci lynch etc and it shows in this film but in a good way although i didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem i was just amazed by the visuals the lighting and of course the performances from everyone who was involved must have truly believed that he was going to push the boundaries in film making which trust me he does and that he was going to have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same br br so what can i tell you about <UNK> cruelty well without spoiling it its a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness which <UNK> into madness a truly unforgettable experience br br keep you eye on <UNK> he can only go onto better things br br i viewed the full uncut print of <UNK> cruelty on a double disc dvd from <UNK> films which is loaded with extras please note there is a <UNK> hong kong release out there avoid this version
<START> i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere i've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever <UNK> <UNK> eerie <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the cave is a film that tries very hard to <UNK> the bar i believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as alien yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the slightest bit scared or thrilled for that matter br br so now that we got the ball of <UNK> rolling i might as well explain why the <UNK> main hook the atmosphere in case you weren't paying attention <UNK> into a waste of my time i'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see the music for one is terrible we either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but i couldn't bear it the many underwater scenes were bad enough it's a well known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell i didn't need rock music <UNK> in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave this actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then <UNK> by the following crash scene br br anyway as i already mentioned it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere heck no the creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to <UNK> horror i'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold the cave does wisely take a page from the alien <UNK> by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame i guess it would be rude to spoil the <UNK> but they are basically the aliens with wings br br i guess you get the point by now atmosphere ruined yet i know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting i'd like to say that about the cave but i'd be lying this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day we've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes the guy <UNK> on the <UNK> and the <UNK> so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien <UNK> in endless <UNK> br br ah but no the pain doesn't end there we must also take the characters and acting into account well i can't remember a single line of dialogue other than run and the only character's name i can remember is jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything other then run and argue they had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply <UNK> it off it's pretty sad when you consider that the cgi <UNK> puts on the best performance in the film br br speaking of cgi there's plenty of it most of which is terrible i do <UNK> them on using suits at least i think they were suits but nothing truly <UNK> with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey br br so i guess to wrap it up the cave is bad and has very little going for it had the film been a scifi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release i might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release with more wit and talent this might have been a <UNK> fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good br br my review from <UNK> waves http <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> page cave
<START> for the <UNK> almost any andy <UNK> film is a shock but despite the fact that i've seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer <UNK> br br this is of course <UNK> take on the <UNK> todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period <UNK> in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there's not a lot for a film with <UNK> in the title the best indication of <UNK> film making here is a meat pie <UNK> only of some poor <UNK> <UNK> br br so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the <UNK> <UNK> curious 3 out of 10
<START> a truly masterful piece of filmmaking it managed to put me to sleep and to <UNK> my mind so boring that it <UNK> sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made avoid at all costs that is unless you like taking invisible <UNK> punishment in which case i highly recommend it
<START> i saw this film on the a e channel this past weekend the mystery was okay i was not able to guess the <UNK> before the end but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery there was a mystery about some of them especially george performed by the wonderful michael and <UNK> cousin <UNK> in fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more from what i've tried to glee about the agatha christie book of the same title i think this film did not follow it to the letter very good performances by the actors involved especially and the lady who played <UNK> companion
<START> i just want to say that chris role as williams for that entire show was emmy worthy it was uncanny how well he did and to be as rapid fire and as random and as creative as robin williams really is wow there were scenes where had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines all while sounds as much like robin williams doing those characters well that my friends is impressive acting its one thing to do a robin williams <UNK> for a couple of minutes its another to do it for a whole tv movie br br i don't know how i felt about the whole show and i don't know how much they played with the facts but i do know that it was chris that kept me watching so for that i give him a 10
<START> the <UNK> and the snowman is the true story of two college age rich kids from l a who become spies for the soviet union one played by penn is already a drug <UNK> up to his <UNK> in trouble the other played by <UNK> lands a position at an firm where his job is to man a top secret cable facility there he learns of some of the dirty tricks employed by the cia on <UNK> that america doesn't like don't forget that the movie is set the early 70s the time of vietnam and <UNK> appalled at what he's learned the <UNK> character decides to <UNK> his country and convinces his buddy to join him neither of them is long on brains it is not long before they're way in over their heads with no way out br br this is not a thriller and is rather slowly paced if this is not a problem for you then it is well worth the rental
<START> this is a truly great film with excellent direction the core plot element the painting of ass is captivating i really can't express in words just how much i enjoyed watching <UNK> getting her ass painted repeatedly br br connor
<START> so it isn't an epic but for people experiencing anything similar br br sibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy an br br imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well br br spent for some reason it hasn't really caught on in the audience br br something i do believe is a result of the main theme why did she br br commit suicide clearly this is hardly something that us br br <UNK> will flock to had it been an european production it br br probably would have reached its audience in a much greater br br extent it is however a movie that although the realism <UNK> by a br br <UNK> <UNK> glow gives the viewer a whole hearted br br impression
<START> a very funny movie michael <UNK> do is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason i'd like to see him do more of these low life roles he was terrific as were all the performers br br the film struck me right off as an american only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didn't need no subtitles br br in a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so two of the best were with john goodman not someone i am crazy about 1 he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says i had to wipe the smile off my face the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles but probably doesn't know it 2 the scene at the end between goodman all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform and <UNK> with the be reiser <UNK> over a table and the two of them then <UNK> that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene this alone deserved a special comedy academy award
<START> this one features an interesting way of handling a camera br br for a <UNK> movie the version i saw was full screen br br but it falls short on the scenario department first you get br br around <UNK> of talk talk talk in a would be hip post <UNK> way then it's slasher city and then comes br br the most <UNK> cheat ending i've seen much worse than br br april <UNK> day where at least it made sense so all in br br all it's the old song and dance interesting director tries br br hard but deserves better movie funny usually it is the actors which are in desperate need of br br something skip it anyway for your time
<START> the women is a cute movie about women at all ages but mostly 30 and their issues in life not just men and infidelity but also about relationships with friends family making time to connect with others problems with image <UNK> your values <UNK> in life and finding what will really make you happy br br it's also about being true to yourself a lot of times people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves sometimes they have created a <UNK> for themselves and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now i really liked this movie granted it was trying a bit to be like sex the city at times but that probably helped me like it the difference here is it's kind of like the <UNK> after the stage in life that the sex the city stars were in here most are married or past the point of trying to find a man now they are trying to find happiness in their <UNK> and lives br br obviously it's not an oscar <UNK> but it is entertaining and serves its purpose br br and for the men out there there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater most were with their wives girlfriends and the men were in fact laughing
<START> this norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide but the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert he meets a man and is <UNK> off to a mysterious city where he starts working in an modern office as an <UNK> the <UNK> seem nice if <UNK> he soon meets a girlfriend yet the city seems utterly strange as food has no taste alcohol doesn't make you drunk and there's <UNK> a children around is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell while at times the films looks as extended episode of the twilight zone even at ninety minutes the movie seems a bit long it is quite thought provoking the best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and <UNK> at discussing deeper issues i always thought there was something <UNK> in advanced <UNK> societies in the way they try to <UNK> the basic <UNK> of human nature and this movie is best when it <UNK> <UNK> this life style unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing
<START> <UNK> mermaid is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the wrong person br br <UNK> directing is his usual outstanding work although this is far from his best <UNK> is very very beautiful despite the character she portrays
<START> what the heck is this about kelly jennifer seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island she finds this juan p <UNK> existing and exotic though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face which he also justify later on in the movie right or wrong these two guys are the first to find each other on the island kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house mr <UNK> they seem to have a great time then billy zane jack characters husband shows up and of course two days without knowing what his wife has been doing <UNK> this gorgeous juan p he is a little bit jealous billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the <UNK> man in the world he <UNK> juan p for hitting his girlfriend at the <UNK> who can blame him hes also is arrogant but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the <UNK> everything cant even <UNK> him a beer <UNK> in 20 min wouldn't you be upset yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him but at the same time he is not to be blamed for suspicious about the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has kelly and billy just lost some dear friends how convenient he just happens to have them no matter what however for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting <UNK> and starts to hate billy for being jealous ok billy is <UNK> thats for sure but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice and even though <UNK> <UNK> at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions but kelly is so <UNK> yeah right and then she starts to have sex with this juan p it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other now you can think that this scenario is possible but for real is it are you cheating your husband after two days on a <UNK> island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case for christ sake juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person catching some fish and built a wood house to get into <UNK> <UNK> is that showing a good side not trying to <UNK> husband in anyway which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island time simply be respect he doesn't care about their relationship and kelly cant figure that one out he just want to have sex with kelly character is just not <UNK> if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl wouldn't she be upset or what or maybe she is billy zane plays a not very nice person and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it and poor kelly is so confused and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p so for all of you who reads this what do you think about it if you where the kelly character would you consider cheating on your husband knowing one day you'll be back in real life and all of a sudden <UNK> maybe not that horrible person after all hes just too jealous and if you where <UNK> character what do you say is he totally wrong in his behavior and juan p character what do you guys really think of him one thing is for sure exist ps the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here what the heck was that about seriously anyone tell me
<START> this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment oh don't get me wrong most of the music back then sucked i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s bands that had some balls forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that <UNK> is horrible and i want to <UNK> garbage but the movies from the 80's are the best they were all about nonsense and just having a good time this movie <UNK> that party get naked get laid
<START> i first saw this movie when i was in <UNK> school back in the 1960s i was fascinated with the character played by ingrid bergman and it was my introduction to the french quarter of new orleans the first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her father's wife and daughter her mother had been driven out in disgrace during this time she meets the wonderful clint played by gary cooper the chemistry between the two is great the second half of the movie takes place in <UNK> ny the <UNK> of the title and i never enjoy it as much as the new orleans setting but it's still very good i give this movie a ten partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of bergman and cooper are equally wonderful <UNK> <UNK> comes close to stealing the scenes from bergman it used to be shown on tv <UNK> but it's shown rarely if ever it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming <UNK>
<START> of <UNK> apple and with your <UNK> i didn't know until looking it up just now also the wants to kill i prefer this very focused deadpan drama over <UNK> <UNK> over the top comedic <UNK> but with your <UNK> is much more layered and subtle but that's another director br br once the part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again a bit claustrophobic maybe that is intentional it builds on the atmosphere you dread the <UNK> and again and again until the in the br br this is some funny stuff
<START> this film is so different to anything you would have seen before it's an honest and chilling account of an entire family's battle with a <UNK> illness br br 'the closer she is shot in a very unique style craig films in a very different way using different angles and <UNK> in what i find is a very eye catching manner perhaps due to his experience with <UNK> works br br his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with br br a very sad but extremely interesting and unique film one i would definitely suggest watching
<START> this seemed really similar to the child's play movies except so much worse a lawyer tries to save a criminal who was convicted of killing his son from execution she fails the <UNK> daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn't hurt anyone throughout this movie i found myself asking myself ' why am i watching this <UNK> ' over and over the end sucked so bad that i went and watched the disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on
<START> <UNK> an italian movie starred by david <UNK> and linda blair i <UNK> expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it <UNK> mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch <UNK> 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
<START> oddly enough it's fred macmurray who plays the more <UNK> part in this screwball comedy carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and <UNK> of drama and seriousness br br as usual fred macmurray remains a mystery to me the camera is no fan of his he's not that attractive and he doesn't have the style and <UNK> to pull off this very cary grant like role br br ralph <UNK> is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with <UNK> character one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle <UNK> love instead of the almost certain doom of <UNK> <UNK> but that's hollywood br br the picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to <UNK> performance it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role lombard and <UNK> are largely believable and likable macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at <UNK> length
<START> you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le elevator to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir
<START> this movie shocked me it was so realistic and the story was incredible touching they talk german and russian which makes it more believable and real this is a must see movie the actors are great too really a good piece of work the plot takes place within a german <UNK> in wwii they have to go to <UNK> <UNK> to fight against the <UNK> you get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the <UNK> as they get captured within <UNK> they get face to face <UNK> with death blood grief and the <UNK> of russia this is a must see movie and you cant afford not to see it
<START> i was surprised by how great black snake <UNK> turned out to be being a fan of christina <UNK> and samuel l jackson id figure id give this a try well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was i mean everything was dead on great and very accurate for that matter this film shows how the great director and writer craig <UNK> who made <UNK> flow another great film can just take anything even something that seems and make it into this well i like how it is just a good time like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way also i love that it doesn't show big of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very the in this was just phenomenal especially from christina <UNK> who deserves an oscar for this role the always great samuel l jackson and even justin timberlake did a great job as well overall almost everything is great about this and while its not <UNK> type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time three cheers for black snake <UNK> br br 9 3 out of 10 stars
<START> motivations of the characters was completely unbelievable many times throughout the movie you find yourself thinking that the characters' actions were totally illogical making it impossible to identify with the characters possibly the writing direction were completely out of sync making the movie painful to sit through i wanted my money back from the video store
<START> this movie is available as a special bonus feature on the double disc of horror 101 horror <UNK> <UNK> it has nothing to do with those movies except it does show that producers directors and are in a <UNK> like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the <UNK> a lot while they get picked off one by one in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity this is by far the worst of the three br br here people are invited to a halloween night only opening of the museum of the dead the museum doesn't have very many <UNK> and they're all sort of ancient central american related there are also flesh eating <UNK> <UNK> zombies in the museum as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors br br the movie is very <UNK> it kills people off fairly quickly to the point you wonder who they're going to have left to kill off at which point some more people show up without explanation so that they can be killed br br amazingly one of the characters does have a <UNK> and is actually able to call the police who actually take it seriously and show up at the museum when one tries to pick the lock to get in the other tells him that would be forced entry if you've got people trapped in a building who are injured i think that's irrelevant the cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in the head it goes down but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don't go down they happen to shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down they continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest stupid br br the opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animation effect over video a poor man's waking life sort of thing but not so cartoonish it is sort of interesting however parts of some of the attacks are done the same way so there's no logic to it br br dreadful
<START> it'll be a blue christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this i loved the original movie and this one was not worthy of being its sequel actually for all <UNK> and purposes it is not its sequel only one character from the original cast returns granted that character happened to be the hilarious cousin eddie but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie his <UNK> is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics alongside chevy chase chevy chase was needed in this film for it to be a success and he definitely was not there as far as i am concerned a movie is not a vacation movie unless good <UNK> clark <UNK> is at the <UNK>
<START> this movie features several well known actors which i usually like so i had at least modest expectations when i rented this on dvd i was highly disappointed in fact i walked off for some <UNK> somewhere during the last half hour and somehow i ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the tv the actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the <UNK> in the movie felt very convincing virtually all scenes had that just a movie feeling to them i just sat there waiting to hear the director calling cut followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next br br since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob like the problem here is just that this whole bad boy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke the constant guitar <UNK> soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fake br br maybe it was just a really really bad script maybe it was just poorly executed i'm no movie critic in fact i consider it rare to see something that's really good but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and <UNK> i'm trying to be not recommended not even as a rental
<START> this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being ground breaking or stellar but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes to me an excellent movie br br i own several copies of this movie and may <UNK> it on <UNK> dvd or <UNK> ray someday holding off right now due to high <UNK> ray <UNK> and of course the face that i don't have a <UNK> ray player but that's beside the point of this review br br it stars off sort of ordinary but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension some action strongly portrayed characters and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end br br wait no it does not start out ordinary br br it starts out sort of like what a <UNK> movie wishes it could be with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a <UNK> goes very very wrong br br by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i won't tell you who watch and enjoy overall rating 10 10 a excellent
<START> dramatic yes historically accurate not quite this movie twists the <UNK> details of the <UNK> by placing lot meeting <UNK> during the building of the <UNK> fascinating time travel for lot made in part by nbc being lot had not been born until years after the thats like having george bush meet with william <UNK> and whats with this guy floating around selling items to <UNK> br br you can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic but don't twist it around placing people where they weren't especially when it comes to gods word
<START> okay so it starts very <UNK> with a narration from the lead character <UNK> played by laura <UNK> an amazing actress in her own right but it goes on to become something <UNK> it has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time there is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of jake containing female mind is trying to get used to her new <UNK> i wont spoil it for you but the second time i watched it was with friends seeing their faces was brilliant it makes you cringe but laugh at the same time i am also a big fan of the music used there is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a <UNK> every now and then but also some gorgeous yet unknown often the best pop songs it has the feeling of being written for an english cast by an american writer which does annoy me only a couple of times overall this film is hilarious i am a massive fan of laura <UNK> now after being given his film for my birthday and expect that even though some of the cast are little known to most you too will enjoy every bit of it
<START> like another ticket <UNK> i saw a nice cute poster about this film it's five star review and awards won thought what the heck let's by a ticket for myself and my two sons bad idea the movie was not a family film it was gratuitous and it contained nothing worth watching
<START> well this stripped my nerves raw they got that right i first rented this movie back in the 80's when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find he also carried all the shock horror and exploitation movies he could dig up and i went through almost of all them previously i had seen blood feast and 2000 <UNK> and the wizard of gore they were gruesome especially for the time period and the wizard of gore got pretty nasty the gore gore girls however was the one i remember as being the most <UNK> gory br br i rented it on dvd a little while ago because i wanted to hear the commentary and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes i forgot that it was made in the early 70's so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then i also realized this was a movie i didn't really need to see more than once it had amusing parts but it was much more disgusting than i remembered i'm very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times i just got too <UNK> out and had to look away this wasn't a good choice of movie to put on dvd all crisp and <UNK> up with better sound and picture quality the commentary is amusing in parts and interesting i think <UNK> said the budget was 00 maybe <UNK> lewis wasn't feeling well that day but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to get offended when the <UNK> from something wild compared him to ed wood jr sorry pal but you're not exactly martin scorsese yourself br br the extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go go dancers in strip <UNK> a cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up sort of he can't seem to stand her to try to solve the crimes <UNK> <UNK> owns a strip club a bunch of really ugly murders happen br br i'm going to apologize in advance because i don't want to sound like i need to <UNK> up but this movie was so misogynistic it p ed me off more than company of men mainly because the main character's and the director's extreme dislike for females and the audience just <UNK> from every frame it's not just the murders the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity for no apparent reason he's not exactly a threat to george clooney like i said and she still follows him around like a puppy she <UNK> upon seeing a horribly <UNK> body and he looks <UNK> at her then <UNK> cold <UNK> from a can onto her face to wake her up later he calls the police to report the crime no no hurry she just seems to have lost face this guy is the hero you can imagine how the other characters feel about women i could go on and on but you get the idea please note that i am making this movie sound much more politically correct and much more fun than it actually is br br most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off not too easy on the eyes so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're not too <UNK> the go go dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their 10 or whatever the going rate <UNK> paid them was and get their drug fix ok it's not quite that bad there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge <UNK> that didn't look as miserable as the rest but still not too thrilled the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene <UNK> yells get outta here before i have you all arrested not to a bunch of <UNK> but to some other policeman <UNK> going about their work they <UNK> and <UNK> off though <UNK> <UNK> is kind of funny though like lewis says he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles i'm sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there though he doesn't look like he minded watching some naked chicks br br might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity for the era the movie was made it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time or if you're really big <UNK> lewis fan and find him or low budget film making by anyone fascinating otherwise if you've seen it once you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low budget movies from the early 70's this movie doesn't even come close to say pink <UNK> when it comes to the skip the popcorn factor if you've never seen an <UNK> lewis movie i recommend you try blood feast first instead you'll have a much better time br br
<START> you know the old saw about a train wreck the one about how you can't look away this movie isn't that good the only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater you might catch a <UNK> br br tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic unsure actor in this production br br i didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place i admit if it weren't basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas my wife and i wouldn't have gone god i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves i <UNK> over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was but she beat me to the punch br br i'm not kidding it's <UNK> only david terrific as usual work saves this review from being only 1 star br br the story is <UNK> insulting and stupid as might be expected for a movie in this genre although the recent curious george was <UNK> intelligent and enjoyable the acting is mostly poor the decision to update the <UNK> songs for today's audience was <UNK> at best and <UNK> at worst it does not work br br the <UNK> of old were clever mischievous and sly these <UNK> are dumb somewhat mean spirited obnoxious and in a surprise <UNK> to the point of <UNK> br br either as a retrospect a tribute or as a completely new production this film totally fails the final straw my son couldn't wait to leave spend your money renting curious george instead
<START> i must admit i did enjoy the earlier episodes but probably because i was younger and stupid at the time i was sorta excited about the return of family guy until i saw the new crap they were putting out no surprise it was exactly like the old crap all the lame jokes were there including the flash backs except this time they added a joke about a old creepy <UNK> who seems to be in every single episode this is just one of the annoying gags family guy lives off of and for some reason people keep watching its no longer funny its just annoying let it die br br maybe family guy was funny at a point in time and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh but now its just not funny anymore if you actually do find family guy funny than you must be retarded or borderline retarded
<START> excellent exercise on multiple plans br br showing the not yet ended <UNK> spirit in france br br more generally the boring mindset of <UNK> from all western people br br a <UNK> of the spy and thriller movies <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and stupid br br the good idea is that in spite of all these messages it is a funny film plenty of jokes and gags very light and <UNK> br br special mention to jean and br br definitely worth seeing wonder how it will be appreciated in us br br seems to be a success in france so probably a next version will come
<START> i saw this movie at the <UNK> film festival in italian speaking part of switzerland br br <UNK> <UNK> is good looking br br i rate this movie 7 10 because of its nice moments br br spoilers ahead br br it has some really nice cinematic moments in it specially at the end br br though my general feeling is this is too long over 2 hours and 40 minutes and containing too much dialogs and nearly no dancing at all br br clearly a bollywood movie like <UNK> or <UNK> is quite a different kind of movie compared with <UNK>
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> best work ever it's one of the all around funniest movies i've ever seen watch it once and you'll be hooked and soon have all the lines <UNK> no sleepy for tommy boy
<START> i turned this off about 50 minutes into it whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of book battle royal make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario deserves to be shot br br it has done the film industry a good turn though now directors like william malone fear <UNK> com can say well at least it's better than series 7 this piece of crap dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made br br be warned this is not a <UNK> bad it's br br this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere br br never see this movie
<START> i seriously enjoy dr who br br seriously don't just dismiss me as a sci fi person because i'm not normally i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it it is actually really funny and more often than not it's fast paced all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle br br christopher is pretty good but david <UNK> is brilliant i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of <UNK> in a tv character again br br i don't know what it is about it but everything manages to work like clockwork br br all i'm going to say is just try it one episode probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two <UNK> though
<START> first off i am a huge fan of robert blake always have been br br this movie came on last night 10 13 and the title interested me of course the star but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started there are some good scenes and i thought they would lead somewhere but they didn't it turned out to be an anti cop anti buddy anti hippie pretty much anti everything movie with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere br br robert blake is great as the lead well as great as someone could be with this bad movie i am still a huge fan of mr blake and love his acting even in crap like this but this drug induced 70's tripe well better stay away from this one and that ending what a
<START> a friend of mine asked doesn't one have to be pro <UNK> in order to like this movie is it a mistake of the movie to <UNK> most want to end their lives interesting questions br br as far as i can see correct me if i'm wrong there is only one who wanted to end his life in the sea inside think <UNK> addressed this in the movie as well it is he who wants to die it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death he is speaking for himself and not other though his <UNK> work depending on one's perspective may prove <UNK> or <UNK> to down the road his primary objective is a personal one but one thing this movie does my opinion anyway is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the questions my friend so <UNK> put forth br br after my first viewing of the sea inside i walked home in a conflicted <UNK> i <UNK> to <UNK> with this <UNK> notion why would <UNK> want to die given the love care and sacrifices so <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> by the people surrounding him why would he <UNK> <UNK> on to his <UNK> decision then on my second viewing a shared thought between <UNK> and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness it threw up a telling observation total <UNK> comes at the expense of <UNK> most human beings <UNK> for such an <UNK> of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individual br br as a person with a <UNK> biased sensibility i <UNK> strongly with the in this movie why can't <UNK> consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends is he blind to it all i would think not the miracle of the sea inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very <UNK> <UNK> of war when we are faced with the of a sane but <UNK> loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a <UNK> gesture does it show up the worth of our love or does it merely <UNK> our selfish fears of <UNK> loss with so much understanding <UNK> to wouldn't their <UNK> charges by <UNK> themselves to the total <UNK> of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice <UNK> or not how much is dignity worth to an individual is living or dying with dignity a <UNK> or a right if we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life as in death a <UNK> of questions the movie might have asked answers to which i'm in no position to provide br br in our <UNK> to intellectually the merits of pro life or pro choice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's the people most <UNK> affected the and the ones they care for the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them <UNK> this film understands one thing that the nature of sacrifice is never one sided in this <UNK> of war we should <UNK> not to win arguments but to <UNK> observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrifice br br the sea inside is a <UNK> film it opened my eyes to things i don't wanna see and for that i am grateful
<START> one of my favorite lines in shakespeare br br i e we're not finished with you by a long shot so not only does <UNK> not get his pound of flesh or the 3 000 or the 6 000 or the <UNK> 000 each of the 6 parts were a in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to <UNK> all his <UNK> and his daughter has long abandoned him already br br vengeance is a dish best served cold but attempt at revenge totally <UNK> br br i suspect this play was and is popular because it <UNK> to the wish we have for justice but the hard reality is the world is <UNK> in injustice and most of it stands a few big names get tossed in jail gang <UNK> lose their <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> but in reality most of the time it's the other way around br br but not in this play the long <UNK> of racism and forgets that it could well have been any other social <UNK> group that gets the <UNK> it's just that the money <UNK> of the time were jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts <UNK> the jew into the role of villain br br <UNK> of <UNK> is my 3rd favorite work by shakespeare 1 and 2 being hamlet and <UNK> this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story the scenes with the <UNK> alone is worth watching also the <UNK> of the new husbands <UNK> and <UNK> the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had <UNK> to keep forever in real life this trick is the thing that <UNK> <UNK> use to remind their better half that promises must mean something and not be made there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedy dramatic aspect it is about loyalty commitment and love br br well worth watching over and over
<START> i've sat through several <UNK> shore movies but this is the only one that i've liked of course it helps that he is far less irritating than usual perhaps even a little likeable the rest of the cast does a fine job especially underrated carla the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy and although few of the jokes are especially funny the film is quite entertaining overall
<START> the <UNK> new groove cast returns for disney pictures follow up but this time the spotlight is on voiced by patrick <UNK> who is no longer <UNK> <UNK> henchman has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant things go <UNK> along until gets word that his john <UNK> is coming for a visit is worried because he knows that his life won't impress his one thing that he has always wanted and never received is a thumbs up from his dad a <UNK> of <UNK> and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant leaves our likable hero very deep in trouble and anxiety to save the day a little help from his friends br br other voices <UNK> <UNK> david spade john goodman <UNK> april and green
<START> throughout this movie i kept thinking why on earth did they make this as a documentary yet not include real footage of the people who were interviewed sure it would have been just like any other documentary but then it would have been up to the film makers to find the meaning for the movie to deliver br br using a host of well known movie stars many of whom apparently asked to be in it to portray real people gave me the feeling that there was a pre determined message to be delivered and the director was so intent on it that real people couldn't be trusted so actors and <UNK> scenes were used yes i know this was also a play but a documentary should be a documentary i really found myself getting put off by the various stars and kept expecting one of them to drop character for a moment and say i'm a good person because i'm in this br br this movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary had it been more objective or let us see matthew shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols the much superior boys don't cry had an <UNK> view of those involved good and bad instead the <UNK> project gives an almost relentless lecture that someone's sexuality should be accepted regardless and little else
<START> if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great <UNK> she is cute funny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays in roles but watching her as <UNK> <UNK> in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james <UNK> who filmed the dramatic and haunting <UNK> close with sean penn christopher walken and co stars <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and don't expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean 80's romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs the 1 hit who's that girl the 2 hit causing a <UNK> and the beautiful and one of her best ever <UNK> the look of top 10 hit in the uk and can't stop a left over pop <UNK> from the <UNK> sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd
<START> my mother told me not to go to see but who ever <UNK> to one's mother br br i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist <UNK> on the way into the theater so i checked with card carrying <UNK> the next day no they also thought it was much more an anti <UNK> <UNK> than a pro feminist statement painting the <UNK> as equal to the <UNK> br br while this israeli movie is careful to show that the <UNK> the story is about is the ultimate ultra <UNK> it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the non fanatic <UNK> rock <UNK> roller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy even in israel that must be fantasy br br the theater was quite crowded so there's a <UNK> up curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies br br originally written 4 <UNK> 2000
<START> sappy br br i liked how they went to the to quote books at each other to impress the <UNK> girl there br br probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job br br just because you keep your nose to the <UNK> is no reason to try to cut a <UNK> with it do you like <UNK> br br the guy <UNK> or something br br well <UNK> ya like <UNK> <UNK> wow that is genius br br duh <UNK> driver would give her number to anybody robin williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf and there's a professor who always wears a priest <UNK> for no reason
<START> this was obviously a low budget film it shows in every scene what is nice to see is where it was made a lot of the film was shot in columbia <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> mountains near <UNK> some of the film was also shot in <UNK> <UNK> very near columbia there is a <UNK> museum in <UNK> and they used some of the old trains in the picture high <UNK> was also shot in <UNK> as was back to the future iii
<START> this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek and i haven't watched trek in years it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way it also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series the cgi definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters except for the <UNK> creature who is a pet with definite attitude anything that would show what he really thought about the <UNK> dog is a 1 in my book he was a stroke of genius br br i am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones i hope and crossing my fingers and <UNK> that nbc or someone else sci fi maybe will continue to run the series and answer those questions br br a really great classy show
<START> no spoilers br br after hitchcock's successful first american film rebecca based upon daphne lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period mistaken identity and espionage as the u s settled into world war ii and the large scale <UNK> of civilians building planes <UNK> and other necessary <UNK> the <UNK> film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often <UNK> thrillers with war time themes these thrillers often involved networks of <UNK> and skilled <UNK> at work in the shadows among the good law <UNK> citizens knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer jack approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption war time <UNK> and a helpless hero thrust into a <UNK> of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary <UNK> dorothy parker during her brief <UNK> in hollywood before returning to her <UNK> roots in nyc who co <UNK> the script were a perfect match for hitchcock's sensibilities br br this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane robert <UNK> who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meets new employee frank frye norman and moments later is framed for committing <UNK> fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far fetched story he meets several characters on his way to <UNK> city <UNK> and finally new york city these memorable characters include a circus <UNK> with a car full of helpful <UNK> and a popular <UNK> model patricia martin <UNK> lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls <UNK> in love with of course in the land of hitchcock patricia kidnapped by the supposed <UNK> barry falls for her <UNK> thus adding romantic tension to the mix br br in good form for this outing hitchcock <UNK> a national network of <UNK> old ladies average <UNK> and respectable <UNK> who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and <UNK> bombs to keep things moving it's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once <UNK> <UNK> in one of hitchcock's more memorable <UNK> look for incredibly life like nyc tourist <UNK> all of which were <UNK> by art directors in hollywood due to the war time on public <UNK> while <UNK> may not be one of hitchcock's most well known films it's a popular b movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific hitchcock villains remember to look for hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his wife was <UNK> by the <UNK> of standards and practices who were afraid of <UNK> the deaf
<START> i like to like movies but i found nothing to like about the box i was interested in the of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably <UNK> it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well i have news for them the emperor has no clothes br br the only <UNK> in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and <UNK> mankind i've heard that story before and it makes less and less sense every time it's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price
<START> i'm just getting the chance to dig into past austen films and i picked this up because <UNK> is has been and always will be my favorite work by jane austen and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my player br br i wasn't disappointed either i knew there were bound to be some draw backs so i'll state them and try not to be too thick about them anne elliot is the most <UNK> of <UNK> characters she is the least <UNK> and the least witty there are <UNK> in the book where anne says nothing only her feelings are described this works fine in print but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen short of doing thoughtful voice overs which would grow tedious over four hours you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and must communicate all by her facial expression this can leave the feeling that the film is slow and lacking in purpose if you need a more overt style of austen then certainly this film is not for you but if subdued is more your style and you tend to pick up on <UNK> this will fulfill all expectations br br anne as anne elliot is thankfully an actress whose face can convey much she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look not a <UNK> anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family nor in her first youth which is also <UNK> occasionally by the lighting and make up what you see is someone who is very like <UNK> character someone whose appearance you might pass over once but hear her speak and look more closely and she grows more attractive the better you know her this is anne elliot as brought to life by anne br br captain <UNK> portrayal is <UNK> handled by bryan marshall the <UNK> is never apparently obvious save at the concert scene and yes i found it hard to believe he wound find <UNK> <UNK> interesting as she was shown but that is another point of <UNK> book he did not find her interesting he tried to find her interesting and ultimately failed sigh of relief so this too fits with <UNK> original story br br i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad this also comes out in this adaptation br br so this is one film which closely followed the book i could write much more about how <UNK> everything was <UNK> but i'd run out of space here charles <UNK> remained one of the most <UNK> characters good fun mary the most annoying i was dying to have her just shut up but i had that feeling when i read the book too <UNK> and the <UNK> i thought charming br br the cinematography i thought a <UNK> stiff there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie one scene chop the next scene the actors enter from right proceed left and chop another scene where the same thing happens this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little a low budget has to show itself somewhere i suppose br br and as i said earlier if you like some pace to go with jane austen don't bother with this one as you'll find it way too slow i enjoyed it enormously though as it brought a wealth of detail the sets were richly elegant to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel i highly recommend it
<START> i've seen professional reviews claiming julia roberts playing herself was clever and very funny i think not an actress playing herself and doing it with her same usual <UNK> whenever she tries comedy talk about <UNK> <UNK> at it's <UNK> why doesn't she just stand there and go me me me look at me the director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel and by the way steven when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem <UNK> hitchcock all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera you seem to have forgotten a <UNK> rule of film making in the name of style the pitt and zeta jones chemistry is quite good however perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and <UNK> with the <UNK> it might have worked once again zeta jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then roberts could dream of sadly this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts i want my money back
<START> it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006 mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her <UNK> on you can have fun finding the others it was a decent stranded hungry cold crazy person video but that is about it and of course what would a movie be without sex the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood wonder if the movie studios know they made a big <UNK> and already released this show and now gonna release it as three billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or <UNK> his head completely juan <UNK> pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes there is a voodoo woman that loves the character <UNK> pace plays and in real life her name is <UNK> pace too not aware of any connection but probably <UNK> or married
<START> someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because reality makes money the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a reality show this will haunt nbc i and about half of my high school about 1000 people total have <UNK> to <UNK> nbc until they bring this show back in my area i don't know about other places but they had a great thing going with the sci fi channel where the sci fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7 00 and then nbc would show the <UNK> new episode at 8 00 this was great because it gave you a little <UNK> as to what happened in the last episode i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that
<START> <UNK> revenge is not a good movie nor is it terrible br br the acting was wooden at least on <UNK> part the puppet had all of 2 expressions as did most of the actors except strangely enough the secondary characters most of them were enjoyable over the top br br the special effects in this are pretty b and as i said earlier the puppet really blew br br the 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand looked pretty good i think they spent about a 1 3 of the budget on that and the shower scene wow i think they must have spent the other 2 <UNK> of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it outstanding br br seriously this is a slightly below average b horror puppet movie rent <UNK> if you have a urge to see puppets kill br br the story had a few interesting <UNK> enough to keep me watching it to the end
<START> i saw this movie on <UNK> the first time then i bought the video and watched it countless times every time i watch it i can get something else out of it it's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good but now the world is changing but you don't have to be older to hold onto the past even the young characters like charlotte don't want things to change the overall tone and mood is excellent the cast is outstanding with all stars like kathy bates beau bridges and arthur kennedy and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films like kevin j <UNK> the mummy and vincent <UNK> men in black and law order criminal intent one of my favorite shows its just one of those movies that stays with you
<START> i've become a big fan of the <UNK> and i didn't really enjoy this movie br br i feel it focused far too much on her <UNK> and didn't let her true personality shine through i wasn't overly fond of <UNK> <UNK> portrayal especially knowing she decided <UNK> <UNK> was suicide which it clearly wasn't although her family was not big on <UNK> and kisses i thought the movie portrayed <UNK> their mother as being terrible br br i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to <UNK> her and make her look <UNK> i thought the metaphor so to speak there was rather effective when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he <UNK> her and feels her <UNK> body was pretty moving which is probably the wrong word as well br br overall i feel they needed to bring out her more <UNK> quirky side her genuine personality even as the focus of the film there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to <UNK> though of course no one can really know and almost made it seem <UNK> the film was more poor singer with <UNK> than karen carpenter's story in my opinion br br i would assume that they changed her husband's name profession and all because they couldn't get his <UNK> to actually include him there were some bad terms there but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes on this note i can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly <UNK> in her life and explains her <UNK> romance and quick marriage to her husband br br on the whole it ends up as a low budget made for tv movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond <UNK> disease i feel that such a legend deserves deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice
<START> dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> fancy term for one of those self <UNK> losers who likes to study extremely rare read nonexistent animals and his crew of hunters manage to trap a a big <UNK> fast moving beast to get it to the <UNK> they <UNK> it on a cruise ship and some idiots open up the <UNK> containing it despite being told specifically not to i guess the strange <UNK> noises coming from inside weren't a good enough <UNK> either the monster then does the monster <UNK> running around biting <UNK> out of various passengers until the <UNK> captain john rhys davies a square <UNK> special agent pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason dylan <UNK> a <UNK> voiced blonde <UNK> bo <UNK> simmons a bunch of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it the main victims who i think are supposed to be the comic relief but it's hard to tell are an old rich bitch paula shaw with a <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> gold <UNK> david apparently the monster can be knocked out with a single <UNK> <UNK> but can live through dozens of bullet hits the design is acceptable though unoriginal but the rest of the movie is devoid of suspense surprise or interest a boring sci fi channel original movie they've made dozens of movies just like this with nearly <UNK> characters and plots but with slight <UNK> on the creature enough already
<START> the ali g show was really something amazing he was so stupid wannabe <UNK> but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending <UNK> cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people and it is very funny so i didn't expect movie to be good cause it was all acted no real people or interviews so the basic point of all show was lost but i was wrong i laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films i ever saw sure it was stupid but who cares if you can't actually <UNK> in to safe with a car <UNK> like someone said it wasn't supposed to be a realistic documentary and it isn't like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesn't mean it is bad when i finished watching i was totally impressed but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway but it still deserves a nine well at least for what it is supposed to be
<START> las vegas is one of the most brilliant shows of our time its combines hard hitting action with light drama and heavy doses of comedy it features fantastic characters lead by the charismatic tough guy ed james <UNK> the show uses cool high tech <UNK> equipment to bring down the <UNK> and <UNK> the characters are <UNK> to watch especially as their different <UNK> within the hotel casino cross paths br br the show is mainly <UNK> around the <UNK> and security part of the hotel casino the two leading characters are ed president of <UNK> and danny mccoy josh former us marine who served in iraq but is now head of security the shows five other main characters are former <UNK> now security <UNK> <UNK> graduate mike cannon james the <UNK> sexy casino host <UNK> vanessa <UNK> childhood sweetheart hotel manager mary <UNK> <UNK> cox <UNK> current sweetheart also big <UNK> daughter and manager of <UNK> molly <UNK> and <UNK> adopted daughter from his cia past casino floor manager holt <UNK> <UNK> who left the show after the second season each character is unique in their own quirky way giving the show its energy and charisma that keeps its audience entertained for the entire duration of an episode br br every episode features a special quest star either a singer actor or band who perform at the <UNK> nightclub <UNK> these cameo appearances by big names is a <UNK> that is popular among the shows audience br br las vegas is a show that can appeal to both male and female audiences for the guys the show features sexy women classy sports cars high stakes gambling <UNK> <UNK> action and overall a pool for topless women for the ladies there is the young and handsome leading man and the tough edgy romance and <UNK> topless guys around the same pool br br the plot of each episode combines action with light drama and comedy to break the ice each episodes also features 2 even 3 secondary stories which <UNK> mainly around the female characters every season also ends with a bang which leaves the audience hanging until the airing of the next season an excellent way to end a season with a mix of <UNK> driving the show and a cast of colourful charismatic characters and of course lets not forget the topless pool makes las vegas one of the greatest tv shows ever aired br br 9 10
<START> excellent story wonderful acting amazing production values and a cool action packed short with a perfect twist at the end what a great short film br br i saw this film in <UNK> or <UNK> at a film festival and was <UNK> by it then i saw it again at another festival where it won again and i was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around for a short film this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time br br <UNK> is not for the faint of heart but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film for any film actually it's an interesting story told very well and every scene moves the story which reveals good film making instincts went into making this film the film looks gorgeous and david morse is also stunning with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene watching his character attempt to defeat the life is throwing him makes a great viewing experience br br it also should be noted that when <UNK> of war are in the <UNK> everyday the lines between reality good and evil can get very gray while the <UNK> gets loud and attempts to make things black and white <UNK> <UNK> allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is what is real and what is not which adds to the mystery br br both times i've seen it the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it which is saying a lot there are a lot of shorts out there right now but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that <UNK> does br br it sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker or has some personal agenda because this really is a great example of short independent film making i see a lot of short films and i must say if only all the shorts making the festival rounds were this good then the shorts business would have some serious legs
<START> the first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting the whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that i started laughing at the awful dialog <UNK> through the film an even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what <UNK> the actions of each character the one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is innovative visual effects however as eye catching as they may be they do little to make up for the <UNK> flaws mentioned above a dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing i was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was
<START> this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i've ever seen i'm seriously considering buying a copy if i can find one dirt cheap to chase away <UNK> company it's honestly that bad i view it as some kind of anti <UNK> weapon if you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage then this movie is a gem just to be fair <UNK> <UNK> character has 1 line that almost works but doesn't quite other than that everything in this movie <UNK> to be insightful but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of <UNK> <UNK> i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the oh and the narrative structure is ill conceived pretentious and amateurish it has failed on both style and substance if you really hate someone invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in <UNK> with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style but that probably <UNK> some <UNK> in the <UNK> conventions
<START> no doubt that the indie flick eddie monroe is one of the better independent films i've seen in a long time the highlight for me was the performance of paul i first saw paul or big paulie as he was called in danny hit indie this thing of <UNK> thankfully the eddie monroe filmmaker s did the same and <UNK> paul's <UNK> skills in a principle principal role out came a performance on camera and voice over as well that shows worthy of big budget studio roles in the very near future it's refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade prove the same to the audience keep up the good work big paulie and we'll be seeing you in hollywood real soon not bad for a kid from huh
<START> this movie is all about entertainment imagine your friends that you love spending time with the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two that's what this film is about an inventive script and brilliantly performed it's not about pleasing the masses with this one it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people which is what i'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it br br the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film in a lighthearted moment there is great dignity in it if you care to look br br a job well done i thought it was a great film i'd watch this before the north american norm any day br br in a nutshell it's not the best film you're ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments i haven't laughed that long in an age
<START> about one step above an <UNK> twins film there's a <UNK> a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the <UNK> <UNK> depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on this guy was supposed to be some sort of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well whatever br br <UNK> <UNK> a great actress whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break out role her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self <UNK> spending her entire vacation <UNK> on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world basically because he's a cute boy yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds ladies let me tell you something if a guy's really into you he's not going to <UNK> off in a <UNK> because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend he may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly contrived and um incestuous but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about br br the plot and dialogue hits every right on cue no originality and no wit but it's sweet and ben's cute so viewers who think titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head one star
<START> i was forced to watch last year in year 10 australian history looking around the class room both classes all 40 students were nearly asleep all 40 heads on the table <UNK> to the person next to them i refuse to believe that because i am only 16 that my opinion doesn't count having studied world war two i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements the acting was poor the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful please do not watch this film it is bias and very <UNK> to the
<START> masterpiece of art gore this cat is definitely a talent to look out for we have in this several longer vignettes with some shorter <UNK> this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewers br br the film kicks off with a short called <UNK> very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked an unseen woman's hand covers the woman's face with a red cloth and makes an <UNK> in her <UNK> out of which an <UNK> stalk is <UNK> i've got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its <UNK> br br human <UNK> is one of the films and it is a totally <UNK> portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister this is one of those must be seen to be believed type things i will say that this film has some of the best effects i've seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most not me though i live for this br br <UNK> could have been cut out of this film all together this is the film's weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people f <UNK> bloody holes in a field and <UNK> very short but this one kind of blows the film's momentum br br right brain <UNK> is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> of religious imagery that i have ever seen and it totally kicks ass think p christ or blood paintings of the virgin mary very hard sexual sexually violent gory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by <UNK> br br <UNK> cruelty is one of the best films i've seen under the <UNK> of extreme horror it will be a very <UNK> film amongst horror fans and the <UNK> public in general some will call it trash some will call it brilliant i don't see much middle ground i thought this film was pretty damn original and i will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it 9 10
<START> i caught this on <UNK> last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style little on substance and originality does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with 70s <UNK> hair and too cool for school clothes plus this film <UNK> in late 1970s <UNK> which works for some <UNK> <UNK> the virgin <UNK> comes to mind but not for this director br br another reviewer compared this to harmony <UNK> work and i agree yet i don't view this as a positive thing what has he done lately anyway is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved if you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a kansas housewife whose <UNK> husband is mixed up in drug <UNK> two professional hit men morgan freeman and his son chris rock murder the husband in his <UNK> room <UNK> <UNK> by the killers witnesses this and <UNK> a <UNK> reaction assuming the personality of a nurse the eponymous betty who is a character in her favorite soap opera believing herself to be the tv character <UNK> takes off in her husband's car which has a load of <UNK> in the <UNK> and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama dr david greg kinnear not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty a handful of men in the know including the local sheriff catch on to what's happening and also seek <UNK> in la the ending is believable and poignant br br if that sounds crazy it's because it is and it's the writer's responsibility john c richards the curious thing is that richards and the director neil <UNK> with considerable help from the performers just about pull it all off this isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold nope i give it bonus points for sheer originality somebody went out on a <UNK> somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago i imagine the people involved down on their knees every night praying <UNK> i don't know if the film was but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms br br it's what might be called an initial premise movie you start off with a single <UNK> event in this case the murder of husband and her <UNK> of a genuinely new personality and follow the <UNK> logical paths realistically <UNK> day is another better and more <UNK> plotted example nurse betty has its logical cracks where the incidents give up their <UNK> <UNK> at a party in la <UNK> finally runs into kinnear the guy who plays her ex fiancé on tv she's stunned because after all she thinks she's betty who lost her fiancé long ago she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as nurse betty the character she <UNK> kinnear by the name of his tv character david the group are puzzled at first then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying in character during the conversation and afterward too after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him <UNK> she's still in character leaving kinnear wide eyed with <UNK> at the relentless way she captures the character of betty on the next date kinnear returns her love that development the relationship between <UNK> and kinnear at this point is a crack in the logic the kind that's absent from <UNK> day by the end of night one kinnear like any other person would realize that <UNK> is a few <UNK> short of a circus br br the rest of the film which includes many <UNK> succeeds beyond expectations the relationship between morgan freeman and his <UNK> <UNK> son is <UNK> spelled out morgan is flawless in his <UNK> he manages to fall in love with the image of <UNK> as he <UNK> clues to her <UNK> and activities and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her she's too sweet to shoot after her transformation into betty she left a note behind in kansas i want to help all life whether it be animal plant or <UNK> who could harm the author of such a preposterous statement his admiration of her comes as an <UNK> as he stands near one of the <UNK> at the <UNK> of the grand canyon <UNK> dressed as dorothy or maybe the good witch of the east well characters that like <UNK> are from kansas anyway appears to freeman and he <UNK> her and kisses her <UNK> it's a scene that's at once eerie romantic and a little spooky i once stood at one of those lights and threw some <UNK> paper into the from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand <UNK> bats who had <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> br br right where was i okay i was trying not to run out of space performance deserves <UNK> everything she does every movement every <UNK> is naive and <UNK> she really is a likable character and that despite the fact that she's no <UNK> girl by hollywood standards but what an actress compare her performance as the <UNK> 19th century <UNK> in cold mountain just the opposite but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film <UNK> <UNK> does a fine job in a minor role watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident kinnear is one of those who wears the kind of ten thousand dollar thin black leather <UNK> that were popular at the time he chuckles and says oh one of those <UNK> deals right okay how do i get back <UNK> doesn't answer she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and <UNK> her head <UNK> br br not a masterpiece of film making but a good original professional job by everyone concerned
<START> of the damned <UNK> is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that i already saw the only thing that i like in this movie is the soundtrack anything else besides that since i am a fan of marilyn <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> park and wayne static of static x br br there are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that i don't even know how to start so many stories were cut like the <UNK> legend one of my favorite <UNK> and <UNK> relationship and even louis is not present to mention a few the plot was dead first they should have made a movie of <UNK> vampire because it is the second book after <UNK> interview with the and not of they tried to squeeze in a single movie so many <UNK> that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles br br so many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie it is <UNK> case for example br br the actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of anne <UNK> <UNK> specially <UNK> that is suppose to be a beautiful tall <UNK> blond guy with blue eyes like <UNK> stuart is also far from being like <UNK> i didn't understand why they changed maker to be <UNK> instead of <UNK> as well br br with the was an awesome movie i loved the actors and tom cruise as <UNK> was perfect and far superior then stuart <UNK> i am sad that tom cruise <UNK> the chance of playing <UNK> again only antonio as <UNK> didn't match with <UNK> looks but anyway far superior from this crap movie called <UNK> the queen of br br anne rice was so <UNK> about interview that i didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production
<START> would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a british neo noir crime film with a cast almost entirely american the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful but entirely in keeping with the performances which are so wooden one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire br br really what kind of disgusting moronic cynical <UNK> is this even neo noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for even if they're wretched and doomed they at least have some decency to them some sense that what they've done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong and that somehow they're stuck with the responsibility for it br br not in this <UNK> these characters are <UNK> <UNK> each other themselves and the audience br br also note that they are low lives all right nothing wrong with that except that they seem to be living a life of luxury for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves the <UNK> here is <UNK> it's all so terribly dull and <UNK> <UNK> know so let's just rip some people off or maybe murder them and go get laid in a luxury hotel what ambition br br this whole mess to some bottom of <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> uneven pacing predictable <UNK> sequences that aren't banal and incoherent set design made for bad tv camera work and editing forgettable score and an entire lack of any imagination or <UNK> in production and direction br br wholly unbelievable unlikeable and for less dedicated movie <UNK> or <UNK> like myself utterly unwatchable br br there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film but they wouldn't print them here suffice it to say you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film just about anything in fact
<START> can they possibly get any worse than this probably but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does well kind of this time instead of <UNK> <UNK> the bad guys he just wounds them by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to <UNK> and foul up the mission the fights just don't have enough bite and the big <UNK> are just big and that's all anna louis seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden also in the cast are <UNK> pierce max ryan and harry van don't put all the blame on seagal for this <UNK>
<START> way back at the dawn of human civilization <UNK> sat around and made lame jokes hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab and women were never seen and apparently at one time had <UNK> these <UNK> lived in a <UNK> diverse region with a a <UNK> a monkey but no women this film tells of the hilarious <UNK> of seven or so <UNK> having burned their land with the new discovery of fire moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra <UNK> along the way we get such great moments of comedy like a fat <UNK> <UNK> a frog that keeps <UNK> in his stomach a monkey throwing rocks at their heads a man <UNK> a mouse to get the frog in his stomach the obligatory gay <UNK> the list could go on and on this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck i was bored from the <UNK> and it only got worse as the <UNK> around hitting each other making poor jokes such as <UNK> on the word <UNK> hitting each other and <UNK> poor <UNK> who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film she isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass et the other bright spot is the music as soon as i heard the score i said to myself that it sounded very familiar i had never heard the actual score but the music was <UNK> that of <UNK> <UNK> it's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude boring <UNK> unimaginative and ridiculous film essentially about a group of finding a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like some animal being taught what she could do sorry i'm <UNK> a yawn as i <UNK> the plot the end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a off your <UNK> this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever the fact that it <UNK> a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will <UNK> viewer interest tail
<START> mel brooks is a great writer director and actor but once in a while even he can have a the beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another you have cary <UNK> who's charming and talented but he can't do comedy his expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the <UNK> in the script richard lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and amy <UNK> is stuck in high school acting mode dave <UNK> shows great comedy range <UNK> and <UNK> for the camera and mark <UNK> is mostly <UNK> in the role of the blind man but then he does still manage to show great comedy range eric allen kramer doesn't have much to do but the few scenes he does have are <UNK> the best roles are those of roger <UNK> tracy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and brooks for when he does appear dom <UNK> has a funny turn as a mafia don <UNK> a clint eastwood <UNK> but on the minus side some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from <UNK> other movies
<START> i'm not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for nurse betty i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie but i'm glad i did nurse betty is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side br br this was one of <UNK> first big one's before hitting it major in hollywood i can see why she is an incredible actress the scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera you can see pain confusion fear and embarrassment on her face just to let you in on the movie she plays betty a shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband she's a waitress and is in love with soap operas especially one where a certain cute doctor dr dave when she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room the murders she notices are two customers she just had morgan freeman and chris rock she then just <UNK> her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fiancée dr dave so she travels along the country to california to find dr and wants a job as a nurse to work with dave she's seen the show so many times somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother despite everyone telling her that she is <UNK> she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's when she meets the actor who plays dave george his real name thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show she just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together br br <UNK> was terrific she was so believable on <UNK> her mind in the movie she has come such a long way and <UNK> you want to admit it or not she's adorable and a great actress br br morgan freeman plays one of the <UNK> charlie who is the father of the two he is so <UNK> and <UNK> by betty and while chasing her around the country he becomes almost just <UNK> with betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her he and his son wesley must find betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities when charlie sees betty and catches her finally she's <UNK> at first but <UNK> down and they know they have a real connection it was a beautifully played scene my opinion is that morgan gave a stronger performance he's just great br br a surprisingly decent performance by chris rock the son wesley he is so gun ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business i loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap together classic nurse betty is a great movie that i'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie i think anyone could enjoy br br 9 10
<START> i do not understand at all why this movie received such good <UNK> from critics i've seen <UNK> of documentaries on tv about the wine world which were much much better when if you watch it please think of two very annoying aspects of first the filming is just awful and terrible and <UNK> to me it looked like the guy behind the camera just received the material and was playing with it plenty of <UNK> for no purpose other than pushing the button in out for instance i almost stopped to watch it because of that secondly the <UNK> the director i think is not really relevant he looks like and ask questions like a boy <UNK> not like a journalist even if the general idea and themes would have been interesting too bad conclusion overrated documentary maybe only for guys who do not know nothing about wine not recommended at all 2 10
<START> ok maybe <UNK> can't compare to other popular cowboy western movies but that's because it didn't have the funding those movies had obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on african american historical involvement and no servants and are not historical involvement hollywood isn't going to be too supportive and believe me they weren't the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> to make <UNK> just so that the story could be told i think that alone is commendable <UNK> may not be oscar material and they don't like black media too much either but it is a start it is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with
<START> less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable <UNK> as to catch a thief and north by <UNK> shot largely on location in <UNK> and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they <UNK> run <UNK> of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to <UNK> their silence br br james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a <UNK> doctor is <UNK> but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story br br the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some <UNK> at a <UNK> shop and day <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> written for this film in a most <UNK> way at an <UNK> cocktail party br br although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock's greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that <UNK> very well with his work as a whole it's hitchcock light but recommended br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> the ruins is to as deep impact was to <UNK> a worse version of a mildly entertaining movie except much much worse one of the characters is supposed to be going to medical school so why are they all <UNK> you can't keep cutting best line form this movie this is an awful movie i like horror movies but fully appreciate that most of them are terrible but had a bit of high hopes for this movie after seeing the reviews on imdb the situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid it is awful the one thing that makes it somewhat <UNK> is its cool australian backdrop despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place
<START> i am very interested in animal children and i have read many rice <UNK> novels but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested nor could i stomach all the absurd unrealistic scenes i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland let's talk about and the actors in ape suits looked like extra large <UNK> rather than great apes there is a difference they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would for comparison see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in <UNK> fashion the apes eat large of meat not a common ape practice as far as i know i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john <UNK> are entirely the parents of <UNK> were <UNK> on an ocean beach but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast give me a break let's talk about <UNK> even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie far from it it tries to be a character study unfortunately the downright silly part <UNK> i did not read <UNK> tarzan books but many of his other series they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose this film just isn't there
<START> for the 1980s this is a very dark movie at this point filmmakers were beginning to operate under the <UNK> that all films require smarmy comic relief which of course is taken to the extreme today flashy action scenes even more overdone today or steamy sex scenes br br <UNK> and penn are <UNK> in their roles as childhood friends turned soviet spies penn in particular is brilliant as hapless drug dealer lee br br what you have here is a true thriller drama there is no eye candy to speak of but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that hopefully most people wouldn't miss it there are a couple amusing scenes in particular the one where penn tries to get his soviet <UNK> involved in a major deal br br well worth watching
<START> <UNK> simon leads a little team of special agents that has <UNK> in finding and returning missing people against all possible odds their latest mission is about the <UNK> of a friend of them she seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing but now the <UNK> are on the case br br comments this is pure b action through and through the key phrase for this is <UNK> supply there is <UNK> supply of <UNK> they don't have to <UNK> once there is an <UNK> supply of bad guys so the heroes have something to shoot at there is an <UNK> supply of breasts many of them bare in an vain and as always failed attempt to distract from the plot holes and there is an <UNK> supply of bad acting it is almost like erika <UNK> performance shines in this what about that and actors that don't seem to care more than the paycheck and why should they when no one else seem to br br and as in most b action movies there are an <UNK> supply of bad <UNK> but these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind i think i saw more realistic <UNK> when i played cowboy as a kid br br but then again i didn't really expect much either how could i from a action movie named the <UNK> and it actually delivers about what could be expected 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the <UNK> between but i am unsure if i can call it entertaining it didn't keep my interest very long br br 3 10
<START> some may think imaginary heroes is a movie exactly like goes down but it isn't in imaginary heroes the director lets us feel for the travis family and the people around them br br the movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done <UNK> and <UNK> acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is the actors director writer dan harris has made a movie that many people should see don't think this is just another teen movie it is a movie about a family and their problems br br i gave this movie a 10 10 because i believe it isn't the best film which no film can be but its the closest it can get to perfect
<START> most <UNK> michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five minute segments tommy boy is a character right from snl a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesn't know anything br br david spade gets the <UNK> overwhelmed <UNK> role he's paired with the annoying overweight <UNK> and they endure miserable <UNK> as they travel cross country to save <UNK> business br br the plot for starters is really <UNK> the whole premise daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family <UNK> can be <UNK> back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together br br the movie's biggest influence is the 1987 comedy classic planes trains <UNK> that movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled it's basic yeah a guy traveling home for <UNK> gets stuck with a <UNK> but it's real <UNK> it makes all the difference the characters are real the situations are far more real tommy boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations <UNK> the characters we feel nothing for them and we don't care about what's happening on screen <UNK> walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate able tommy boy is simply absurd with jokes like a simple deer in the <UNK> turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead then <UNK> and <UNK> their car br br the whole <UNK> car thing is stolen completely from <UNK> and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin john candy movie br br <UNK> is simply way too obnoxious to find likable i've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind <UNK> given very little to do serving as the movie's most <UNK> character br br dan <UNK> is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy <UNK> business the ending is a joke and not in a <UNK> <UNK> funny way more like a oh god are they serious way br br some people dig it that's cool but i just can't get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrows from not just counting <UNK> a without any credit whatsoever
<START> this cheap grainy filmed italian flick is about a couple of <UNK> of a <UNK> in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house br br i wasn't impressed by this it wasn't really that scary mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be a girl her two cousins and one <UNK> girlfriend head to this huge house for some reason i couldn't figure out why and are staying there cleaning up and checking out the place characters come in and out of the film and it's quite boring at points and the majority of deaths are quite rushed the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death and the scene is quite good but then things get slow again until a confusing end when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way and this weirdo guy i couldn't figure out who he was during the movie or maybe i just don't remember goes after this one girl attacking her until finally this other girl kills him off hate to give away the ending but oh well the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it and they show scenes of her living there years later the end you really aren't missing anything and anyway you probably won't find this anywhere so lucky you
<START> despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isn't too <UNK> and pink because love is as a rose with <UNK> that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth br br the music and lyrics of the <UNK> <UNK> esquire songs sung b <UNK> knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it <UNK> mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the <UNK> relationship which is <UNK> by joy and jealousy br br london gets <UNK> from another angle for once the <UNK> life of dylan during the <UNK> of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small <UNK> <UNK> and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger br br maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story
<START> east side story entertains and informs about an unknown part of cold war history what is the purpose of any documentary to inform the reader through commentary and footage this one succeeds at both you will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are br br you get to see and her music from musicals made in east germany russia and other countries under soviet control it shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a <UNK> would look for which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and hopefully white teeth
<START> lost <UNK> a place for food fun and murder after a guy disappears on his way to a gas station a group of her friends head out on a trip to search for him they come across a wax museum where they think their friend might have ended up unfortunately for the friends however the owner of the <UNK> attraction possesses the power to control his wax <UNK> and use them for evil one by one the tourists are stalked down and killed by and his legion of wax <UNK> can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend following in the footsteps and <UNK> them around of the great classic wax films house of wax mystery of the wax museum tourist trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style as far as character development action dialogue flow etc it seems to be just a basic slasher flick but it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is the acting <UNK> from acceptable from the main cast to very good from backwoods <UNK> mr played by western legend chuck <UNK> the writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story also some scenes are a bit silly like the <UNK> <UNK> attack on <UNK> it's nothing however that would detract from the effect of the film as one would expect from a film about wax <UNK> it is full of the endless creepiness <UNK> by the <UNK> it's strange that a mostly <UNK> object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling perhaps it's the human <UNK> or the blank stare or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack whatever it is the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film as far as slashers go it's one of the best and it stands as one of the <UNK> films i've ever seen br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore the film is full of some cool deaths the gore isn't excessive but it's done well and leaves it as being realistic br br sex nudity there is an extended skinny <UNK> scene with the very attractive lead females though <UNK> <UNK> barely begins to describe the ravishing future angel <UNK> roberts but it's all a <UNK> as the girls remain mostly underwater they do remain scantily clad throughout the film however br br cool killer s creepy is just the beginning of and his <UNK> one of the best killers in the slasher <UNK> br br scares suspense from the opening scene on the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the <UNK> jump scares from the attacks and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation it's all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film br br mystery well mystery wasn't really the point of the film just the meaning behind all of it is what matters br br awkward dance scene all these cute girls and not a single dance shame br br final verdict 8 10 see this creepy slasher br br <UNK>
<START> i may be a but i found this movie truly moving it was the first movie that reduced me to tears and it did it more than once i recommend it to anyone both gay and religious or not supporting co star jackie <UNK> stole the show especially with her one liners the nude scenes were superbly crafted as well and all in were good taste most shocking was the portrayal of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the mormon church to the lead character it shocked me that this still goes on in the world nevertheless i enjoyed this movie tremendously this is definitely the best gay film since torch song trilogy and much better than the other gay movie offering that year the <UNK>
<START> this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear the performance of marie <UNK> i hope i am spelling it right as a drunken old <UNK> is reason enough to see this film it is an amazing performance she is in a drunken <UNK> in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done amazing and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and <UNK> great the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories very deep and intense this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile
<START> but memorable because it includes an actor i actually recognize james is by these types of <UNK> standards lawrence olivier he's given some decent performances on stuff like <UNK> and various star <UNK> so it's kind of amusing if mildly depressing watching him <UNK> himself here okay yeah there's a plot character and his wife are fighting he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his masterpiece film and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of <UNK> but watching is really the only enjoyment to be found here
<START> br br br br 5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters stories of war drag queens and and <UNK> in general being represented as <UNK> living off the land saying words like and generally being the classic underdog br br luckily australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is <UNK> out modern day such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boy and <UNK> people br br in this evolution of film we also find two hands br br set in kings cross two hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town played by bryan brown is a sydney mob boss he's the king of <UNK> crime wearing <UNK> carrying a <UNK> and helping his son with his <UNK> he's vicious but real as are his holding <UNK> to someone's head in one scene and then playing in the next they are well respected and if they ask you for a favour you don't say no br br enter jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is your average aussie guy in his early <UNK> he's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone's bad side so when asks jimmy to deliver 10 000 jimmy accepts br br things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while jimmy is at the beach so now jimmy is 10 000 in <UNK> to a major mob boss from here we start to see all the <UNK> stories with jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money jimmy and alex the love interest played by rose <UNK> trying to find jimmy and of course the two teenagers and their new found <UNK> the concept is <UNK> by the narrator <UNK> dead brother michael who was killed by and his gang years earlier br br in the end all the <UNK> connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and <UNK> the audience i thoroughly enjoyed it br br
<START> i've enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect <UNK> and this is one of them the characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people working together <UNK> building a team and achieving goals without ever preaching morality the situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise the tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout the movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters and to laugh pretty well all the way through this is a feel good movie as good as they come br br what <UNK> me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining the music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the <UNK> the scenes in the credits are a great music video of in the navy which deserve their own full screen special feature the scenes and cuts are crafted well and the casting and acting is right on br br this movie is a classic as great as any ever made without any <UNK> in fact the lack of <UNK> is what makes it so much fun to watch i love these guys and gal br br the other day i thought of the film and wondered whether it was available on dvd good fortune has come to us and the dvd came out in may 2004 i headed to the store and <UNK> up a copy then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen i've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels far better than many high budget films and oscar winners this is entertainment br br listen up fox home video you have a great movie in your <UNK> and it's a shame to find a cheap shot dvd with badly <UNK> off <UNK> colors only 8 years since release so why not <UNK> the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen i'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right i'm grateful to have my own copy now give us the eye candy that the film deserves and how about <UNK> the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature
<START> i agree with the <UNK> comments for the most part however there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal christina <UNK> <UNK> a rural property that she <UNK> to open a mountain <UNK> she gets <UNK> with chip bobby <UNK> whom she had known when she was growing up in there the plot <UNK> when james paul logan arrives with his new stripper friend lane because christina had been <UNK> stripper friend in years gone by and the <UNK> is that james had done her wrong somehow to add interest to the movie sophia <UNK> <UNK> parent a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the <UNK> as do eric <UNK> guy and linda flower pair of lawyers from the city james the local building <UNK> inspector on business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down so the question is how far will james go to <UNK> the <UNK> and will he succeed br br watch for lane here and in beauty betrayed she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the r world another notable is samantha <UNK> playing the role of bait clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies
<START> i know if i was a low budget film maker i would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it so i really hope the creators of the movie actually read this i think you should find a way to <UNK> me for the hour and a half of life i just wasted watching this garbage please stop making movies about something you probably <UNK> about just stop making movies all together you are one of the reasons it is so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big do the world a favor and get a job a <UNK> or something so you can do something <UNK> with your life i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store
<START> a movie about a french girl who gets raped by street <UNK> the rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera in a fit of rage the victim grabs her friend's or was it brother gun shoots him and runs off with the weapon she meets this prostitute who has just seen her <UNK> shot down they team up and make off towards paris a series of crazy meaningless and wild killings follow the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before one poor guy gets shot in the hole there are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings br br the movie is not the most violent i have seen i would say saving private ryan probably had more violence in it if violence is what you are looking for then there are lots of other movies out there and if it's sex you are out for then i would suggest one of those <UNK> ones br br i went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it the movie itself is no big deal just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand held camera i was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in sweden if 15 year olds can watch this movie they should be able to watch <UNK> movies too
<START> ok chuck norris has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years this is not one of them i won't even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible <UNK> gone wrong the acting of the main characters is so wood like <UNK> would have done a better job the <UNK> based soundtrack is even worse than the one in deathstalker whereas <UNK> low budget spooky movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of graphic violence this one is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> the plot <UNK> down to different versions of the bible
<START> <UNK> animation easily rivals that of pixar and goes well beyond most anything i've ever seen disney do while some say the story is a bit too abstract i find it a thought provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bumbling animals typically found in animated shorts it's an <UNK> version of <UNK> anyone who has left the safe harbor of home and gone off to a lonely frightening place by themselves will readily identify with this <UNK> excellent work mr anderson br br
<START> my mother and i rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for <UNK> i have rarely laughed so hard this is a typical low budget horror movie with dumb special effects a worse plot and even worse acting but are you really expecting a classic when <UNK> <UNK> receives top billing i thought not br br since this movie does have some entertainment value i give it a 3 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst mini series i have ever seen on tv i sat through the first half hoping it would improve but it only went from bad to worse needless to say i could not bring myself to sit through the torture of a second nights viewing what was jon voight thinking when he made this
<START> so we saw this on dvd at our apartment here in paris we're all here on an exchange program we all laughed so hard <UNK> so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us i mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true know what i'm saying br br i think i related more to the quiet guy the italian than <UNK> because i'm more of the <UNK> in our group anyway i wish i had a hot roommate like <UNK> de france she seems like a cool chick in the movie and for real after i saw her <UNK> the cannes festival last month br br now i'm thinking i wanna go to <UNK> next summer after seeing this movie i gotta check out the sequel too which just came out here in france
<START> the story is derived from king <UNK> the setting is a farm in <UNK> here's a test for this kind of thing if you find yourself asking why did so and so do such and such and the answer is because that's what happened in <UNK> you know that the film has failed well that is what happens here the father figure in this story isn't living his own life he's <UNK> a fictional one but there's more wrong with the film than this br br <UNK> is ambitious far more ambitious than i think she realises she's trying to take the king <UNK> story and completely change the setting this is a task in itself the result is that the <UNK> story will die and nobody will quite be able to work out why although there are enough successful <UNK> like west side story to make it worth trying but she's also attempting a <UNK> retelling in the version of king <UNK> she wishes to create reagan and command our sympathy and is a villain this is a task in itself too br br <UNK> at either task is hard <UNK> at both at once is impossible in fact <UNK> at one while so much as attempting the other is impossible if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events which means there can be no <UNK> with setting if the story is to be <UNK> alive into a different setting its moral heart must keep beating the whole while which means there can be no <UNK> with <UNK> perspective was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her <UNK> and so she did naturally it's possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some <UNK> hit upon a work of art that's good for independent reasons i mention this because i haven't read jane <UNK> novel which for all i know is good for independent reasons but the film isn't if there was nothing else wrong with it there would still be no getting around the fact that it's just so thoroughly excruciatingly dull the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life which <UNK> be the case since off the top of my head i can think of four films the wizard of oz north by <UNK> the straight story in which the <UNK> aren't boring at all
<START> i thought that one dark night was great it deserves a 10 as to a statement made by one user the dead were actually zombies in this movie a dead person brought back to life is a zombie regardless of the method or cause for of being brought back to life the zombies in this movie are used to <UNK> the girls not to feed off of them like traditional zombies this movie is a definite star among horror flicks of the 80's the score and atmosphere are quite eerie and the audience is kept in suspense throughout the <UNK> scenes the acting is actually convincing with genuine expressions of horror at the sight of the undead although i enjoy all zombie flicks this movie is a refreshing change from the typical flesh eating zombie movie
<START> this stinker is in <UNK> frequent <UNK> on one channel here and i've found myself watching in horror again and again the script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks and the production values match admirably br br it's meant to be a children's movie but features a grotesque and poorly explained kidnapping scene the star dog has a lack of star quality <UNK> only by the other actors and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background br br it even all <UNK> up with a budget ran out voice over sequence when the story to one's relief simply stops the high <UNK> here must be either the producers or the majority of the extras from the soccer game
<START> what can you say about a film that makes the erotic witch project look like the english patient again the plot and characters are secondary but the plot is almost an exact copy of br br four <UNK> <UNK> sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare <UNK> and the women become sexually charged the bare <UNK> leaves porno devices and a blow up doll just like in they get lost the <UNK> gets lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel there they <UNK> the end of the blair witch project as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing a game integral to the thin plot br br at least three of the <UNK> sisters here have <UNK> large breasts full of <UNK> and stretch marks along with the rather obvious surgery <UNK> the one natural gal here is <UNK> by the director in a very unfunny and overlong end credit segment <UNK> scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad <UNK> br br julie strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare <UNK> this one scene seems to be added later since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it in the background as the women <UNK> and stroke you can see someone's <UNK> fence this may be director jim backyard br br this is just bad stuff the lesbian love scenes are <UNK> degrees <UNK> than the erotic witch most of the <UNK> consists of the four women <UNK> their eight collective breasts together i think they are trying to form a <UNK> based that would rescue them from this bad career decision no such luck if imitation is the <UNK> form of <UNK> then the makers of the blair witch project should be really really mad br br this is <UNK> and contains mild physical violence strong profanity female nudity sexual content and sexual references br br
<START> a young frenchman himself as he becomes an <UNK> exchange student in <UNK> and comes back a better man sounds boring no way the movie is filled with colourful people all of them stereotypes the british and her racist brother the sexually <UNK> <UNK> the ultra <UNK> german in this case though the stereotypes are brilliantly done you feel like you know people like that i for one know an arrogant doctor and his <UNK> wife and they're just like the characters in the film they feel like real people br br go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles
<START> rko was trying to boost its <UNK> joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong <UNK> enough to make a doctor john <UNK> come to terms with running away from <UNK> in this little <UNK> tcm aired it as a stepping stone in the career of joan fontaine br br fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job nothing more and john <UNK> is okay as her love interest but it's obvious that philip huston who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine whatever happened to this handsome actor why didn't rko promote him along with fontaine he showed skill as a light comedian br br these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title the story itself is rather tiresome only occasionally coming to life because of <UNK> spirited heroine br br she photographs <UNK> as the nurse and wears her serious expressions <UNK> suggesting that there was more to be <UNK> at a future date <UNK> never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why strictly lackluster br br but whatever happened to philip huston evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career br br trivia note watch for dwight frye of dracula as the out of control patient aboard the airplane
<START> danny lee's performance as a <UNK> cop is the only spot of interest in this film even though it has an excellent cast including <UNK> <UNK> fat <UNK> andy <UNK> on and alex man plays a <UNK> boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but alex man a total psycho who has a big grudge against won't let him tries to escape to but to no <UNK> after his family is blown to bits his <UNK> dead or <UNK> wounded and broke returns to hong kong to get into some serious revenge br br it sounds a lot better than it is is well dressed and handsome looks <UNK> <UNK> and cries on cue but somehow or another you just don't care andy <UNK> looks great but that's about it <UNK> has a tiny tiny little part which was nice but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that alex man is a cartoon villain he's so over the top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden variety nut br br danny lee is great though too bad he's only a small <UNK> on the screen of this dark literally and essentially boring movie br br rent it don't buy it or just skip it altogether br br this is the sequel to rich and famous even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously it was released first because of power
<START> this off beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews my question is why i think this movie is pretty good dee <UNK> did very well for his first and only time directing he also plays the antagonist captain <UNK> this movie seems to have a view of the future although it came out back in 1998 it seems to be about modern issues internet <UNK> seems to be the underlying plot here although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today i'll admit the story fell short a few times but that doesn't make this a bad movie at all robert englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better the acting wasn't bad the characters were pretty good as well was a pretty good antagonist i think i give this off beat horror a 7 10 recommend for fans of saw
<START> this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in <UNK> as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the <UNK> world of america the <UNK> family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone <UNK> set amid the harsh <UNK> stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass an opening sequence sees the <UNK> males <UNK> <UNK> up a <UNK> <UNK> stones in their mouth to offer at a <UNK> at the top in exchange for a that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are it further shows life aboard the liner <UNK> masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in <UNK> island where their journey still not over they are <UNK> and examined to prove their to enter america what is not shown is the ship in <UNK> or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large ocean going liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify america no cliché view of new york <UNK> and the statue of liberty so that <UNK> island could be anywhere in any country perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera <UNK> looking down on hundreds of people <UNK> together slowly almost <UNK> two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the <UNK> a powerful statement of society being <UNK> there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an <UNK> of typical families conditions at the time with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn <UNK> at the <UNK> but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed
<START> first off i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead this movie sucked br br possible spoilers if you haven't seen the tv series where to begin well let's start at the quality the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted however the cgi was horrid br br then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our <UNK> to <UNK> what would happen in the future br br and then there is the stories biggest fault adding wwii and hitler why the series was perfect and didn't need hitler it didn't even need germany br br overall the entire movie was sorely <UNK> in what a true movie could have been and if i were the directors i'd <UNK> <UNK> and make a new more ending ending
<START> i won't bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them and hopefully you are already familiar with park chan work br br i strongly disagree with some of the other <UNK> in saying that park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah because you know what he has the vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the and subtlety of sympathy for mr vengeance with the frantic and <UNK> of <UNK> park chan <UNK> has incredible style but his movies don't all share the same style that has been true and remains true with the release of <UNK> br br <UNK> is an incredible picture it literally has everything you want in a movie jaw dropping violence <UNK> gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes the story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next i'm so happy to say that park is back in top form with this fantastic dark comic vampire love story watch it as soon as you can
<START> antonioni with <UNK> <UNK> some of the best of the best story character visuals like most of their works it is not really aimed at the children or the childish don't miss the genius contained in this one
<START> i really wanted this to be good as i am from <UNK> where it is set but it truly awful the acting from everyone involved is <UNK> the script is terrible <UNK> terrible terrible
<START> i think this film version of <UNK> <UNK> is actually quite good it certainly is amusing well it's not a masterpiece as pride and prejudice <UNK> but there's very good stuff in it especially the city of bath setting the royal <UNK> the roman <UNK> the fascinating <UNK> atmosphere that is excellent if you are a bath fan like myself you'll love watching this film the performances may sound a bit too melodramatic but i've got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period the only <UNK> is probably the female lead as i personally have another idea of catherine physical appearance the music is also a bit unusual but i strangely find it acceptable despite it's got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed i'm wondering what would dear old jane think
<START> this is one of those movies that go out of print and are very expensive on ebay this movie is a little known fairly amateurish flick that has the strong advantage of being the only movie that shannon appears in multiple nude scenes looking very seductive i might add it also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish shannon and smoking fetish <UNK> it's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror drama <UNK> movie it tries a little <UNK> but you can see what's coming a mile away shannon does a decent job with her role but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateur night as is husband character avoid unless you're one of the groups i mention above now let's hit ebay and see if we can <UNK> this thing 8
<START> dee <UNK> was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie this movie he wrote directed produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs horror from stay hungry people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king wes craven dean <UNK> or in his own time alfred hitchcock the movie <UNK> a modern psychotic created by current <UNK> in society personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims criminals this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and <UNK> it could happen
<START> a <UNK> force army unit assigned to find a <UNK> of missing green <UNK> bad <UNK> not known for going completely missing will be in a fight for survival against a <UNK> <UNK> man the supposed spirit of an ancient indian warrior who was <UNK> when <UNK> disturbed his grave the <UNK> man rides a horse and has the ability to <UNK> to and <UNK> using a type of dimensional <UNK> and seems <UNK> by bullet fire and <UNK> the <UNK> man's horse leaves no <UNK> <UNK> and he can ride from behind and around his prey <UNK> the film's point of view through the <UNK> man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color in other words he's not seemingly human so how can captain <UNK> michael <UNK> as <UNK> and intense as ever and his gang of would be <UNK> stop this menace for some reason the <UNK> man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant what are the <UNK> man's motives for <UNK> endless human beings and why is a blind indian living in the forest our <UNK> inhabit <UNK> if the <UNK> man as a human slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself br br as completely stupid as it sounds just unbelievable horrible this is the kind of film that can brain cells casper van <UNK> gets second billing in the credits just under <UNK> yet is <UNK> with a ridiculously <UNK> character who <UNK> the film quite early <UNK> deserves better than this if i were an actor i wouldn't want this movie in my resume the <UNK> man is a reject knight from a de film he has a <UNK> which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact an arrow shot from the <UNK> man's bow actually destroys the <UNK> of a <UNK> plane for nearly 99 of the film bullets are shot at the <UNK> man and he can go in and out of that <UNK> <UNK> yet at the end all of a sudden he becomes vulnerable to attack oh and the horses also change as the <UNK> man <UNK> moves through the forest from that <UNK> the film is written and edited by <UNK> the attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters who are supposed to be experienced pros make really bad decisions throughout this film the mind <UNK> with this film good for some laughs and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie
<START> it's too slow paced and complex for children and too lightweight and dull for adults none of our family 6 weeks to <UNK> years could be bothered watching it all the way through br br are there jokes in it i couldn't really tell there was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo there was probably a <UNK> message of sorts but i wasn't engaged enough to care br br the live talent are just stumbling and <UNK> their way through it i have to wonder if they were actually being paid or whether it was some form of community service or <UNK> bargain br br please keep watching <UNK> daniel honestly i wouldn't bother
<START> this movie i totally not funny and i would imagine to be pretty offensive to jewish people and i am not jewish why first the whole movie portray the protagonist <UNK> as a cheat running shady business and deals while his son is gay his daughter is lesbian and his niece is a slut then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family first his daughter with his joshua and <UNK> and then his son with his niece two incestuous relationship running in family i am surprised they didn't add the plot of having a mentally disabled in the family now that would really complete the nazi ideal sub human gay lesbian jew br br totally disgusting film i am surprised this film gets no response from any jewish community
<START> this relatively obscure hong kong is the perfect desert island movie for video age <UNK> at least its first half is every set up every scene every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's <UNK> stare down at her breasts <UNK> at her bottom and <UNK> at her tight <UNK> what it's establishing is the lead character's perverted <UNK> of course br br genre <UNK> anthony wong is a <UNK> perverted married man who is plagued by erotic <UNK> and outrageous fantasies all involve scantily clad sexy chinese ladies with nothing but sexual <UNK> on their minds br br the plot is <UNK> by a homicidal subplot voodoo doll <UNK> and a little rape and <UNK> br br some of the sex scenes are fairly hot and the gore is liberal but the supernatural elements introduced into the second half feel half baked and the plot developments are ludicrous br br clearly producer of <UNK> garbage wong <UNK> was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of theaters br br the arty title sequence did not fool this jaded <UNK>
<START> it's not real flashy but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters and letting you know their hopes and desires while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet a very sweet movie fun also to see vincent <UNK> and mary louise parker so early in their careers
<START> i really don't know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror it was confusing to say the least what really upset me however was the lack of story development between the characters br br the <UNK> bruce 17 year old daughter clara <UNK> is stuck with him for the summer and they don't spend 30 seconds on screen together at any one time br br the hot native american jennifer lee <UNK> apparently has the <UNK> for the sheriff but they don't spend any time together either br br the hot secretary <UNK> honey ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put together br br the bad <UNK> vs the native americans is an <UNK> story but i personally like evil <UNK> getting theirs as i live in florida br br the only reason i stayed with this was the creature it was original i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures
<START> warning some spoilers included though it is a documentary br br i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d a and chris which includes moon over broadway com and the war room all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend watching this ultimately boring and account from 1988 tour i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together the band members were certainly less than <UNK> on camera hence undoubtedly the contest to add fans on a one week bus trip was added to <UNK> things up a bit really now i mean c'mon who thought a concert film of a <UNK> pop band with three <UNK> and a singer would be a good idea granted i like music and martin gore writes good <UNK> but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting and this movie is proof positive unless you are a huge fan of mode stay away from this documentary it's a complete waste of time
<START> here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become auteur suddenly 80 through the making of this movie <UNK> spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth gone wild there are <UNK> good girls bad girls gangs the kindly old diner manager and the town creep things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end when the only likable character is killed off and the anti hero is blamed this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie but all this stuff starts happening and during the final reel major <UNK> ball then things get weird the kindly old <UNK> forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp the mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer the <UNK> creepy town nut which in any real universe he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with even if the anti hero was found with her body br br we're left with a somewhat feeble happy ending which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes <UNK> it br br even more odd is this film's <UNK> on playing homosexual innuendo to the <UNK> but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight maybe this was on purpose perhaps resistance to <UNK> down with the girl was more because of his sexuality which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him than his need to be a drifter if the director's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn that the drifter <UNK> because he feels he's an <UNK> sexually that his <UNK> regard towards danny is not in fact <UNK> but <UNK> that his inability to remain with carrie is <UNK> in a sexual <UNK> that even he does not quite understand it could have been made more clear instead we get this very bizarre <UNK> of <UNK> and behavior that is completely <UNK> br br these young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out when danny is <UNK> and once even in bed with a woman <UNK> out and takes him away danny pays way sure there is another explanation for it but it still strikes a <UNK> every time you see danny buy lunch they end up living together at the end not since hitchcock's rope has homosexuality been so blatant but denied br br mst3k did the right thing by taking this one on aside from jack <UNK> there is little to <UNK> the film
<START> i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life to date this movie is his best piece of work br br the plot is a mixing of stephen <UNK> book of the same title <UNK> with the man's life the story is told through interviews with family friends and himself br br don't be fooled it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking the <UNK> of life and theories is <UNK> and thoroughly entertaining i was particularly moved at how well they <UNK> this genius and <UNK> man tho physically <UNK> <UNK> greatness and <UNK> brilliance is <UNK> into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and <UNK> over at the same time br br find this movie watch it and enjoy and if the studio who owns this picture reads this a 15 year <UNK> edition would be perfect now
<START> what will be <UNK> in the <UNK> century what is his life why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in <UNK> this man john cassavetes is a broken hearted giant he can command the storm he's got the power the but he is human deep love of life is the subject of this movie the acting is incredible all the genius of john cassavetes gena rowlands <UNK> and shakespeare and paul <UNK> of course don't miss it it'll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies
<START> this was pretty bad pedestrian work or worse i don't think it was <UNK> just really bad if anything it was really amateurish like when you're 14 and first discover curse words and skin <UNK> br br the main point of this movie the romance falls really flat i can't help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this movie br br plotting and pacing are horrible going nowhere at all one minute we're watching these guys catch <UNK> then we're at a gay club then we're at a date out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics and then they sleep together none of this feels real like an <UNK> school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boy br br the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl unnecessary and actually kind of disturbing br br still you have to watch it why br br as others noted the director's commentary actually is hilarious what kind of of professional talks about <UNK> or <UNK> up with the actresses dialogue sucked relationships lacked chemistry you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass
<START> this movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers especially contemporary audiences nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down to earth charm of william <UNK> one of my favorite stars and the dazzling beauty of jennifer jones there are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors <UNK> what in lesser hands could've been trite lines the cinematography of hong kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie all in all a better than average romantic drama 7 10
<START> it's hard to tell who this film is aimed at the characterisation and style <UNK> of a children's <UNK> series crossed with an aussie soap yet the subject matter nudity and language aims it at an older audience br br the first half hour has the heroine <UNK> <UNK> about losing her virginity and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18 a complete rip off of <UNK> <UNK> from the talking at the camera bit down to the on screen graphics br br her nerdy friend brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man or actually creates a male alter ego of her called jake don't look at me like that i'm just relating it the way it was shown br br after this the film is mildly amusing for a while amongst all the drama school <UNK> only rupert <UNK> jones brings a real comic touch to his woman trapped in a man's body role of jake there's some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body and new feelings nothing you haven't seen before but then in this film you'll <UNK> at anything that's entertaining br br unfortunately <UNK> and jake meet up and hilarious antics ensue i wish involving the owners of the <UNK> machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him or examine him or something anyway it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases for such a cheap looking movie the explosions come often and loud suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong places br br in the end the heroine realises she can't fall in love with herself <UNK> her alter ego and ends up in a one night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s but only after he <UNK> his glasses and puts some hair <UNK> and a leather jacket on god <UNK> she actually have sex with someone who looks like a nerd of course this is a bit <UNK> in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself and that everyone is special in their own way it's <UNK> <UNK> to have a film which screams <UNK> at you and treats <UNK> and <UNK> with the contempt they deserve br br the characterisation is simple dire the nerd is very nerdy room full of computers thick glasses social virginity no leather jacket there's a slut she's very <UNK> blonde tight dresses orange <UNK> accompanying music there's a jock he's very well you get the picture you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy but virtual sexuality isn't very funny it's only mildly amusing in parts and excruciating in others it takes a lot for a woman as cute as <UNK> played by laura <UNK> to annoy me but she manages it br br don't be fooled by the title there's absolutely nothing erotic about the film and it doesn't deal with the topics of how the new <UNK> <UNK> are changing the way we view and <UNK> relationships unless you actually think there is a chance your <UNK> might blow up and change your sex br br
<START> the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair jimmy <UNK> plays a character that could have been upset by the <UNK> of the story he is evil and a wife <UNK> it's a character as far from his <UNK> and la law roles as you could possibly get br br if you've thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role <UNK> your present br br but mary louis parker wears black <UNK> and little black throughout the movie br br she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer br br i'd buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available
<START> okay so writer director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye catching names good for him now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here hell ride isn't a movie it's a <UNK> and hopelessly inept fan boy <UNK> to bring homage to the notorious biker flicks of the 60's and to the recently <UNK> <UNK> cinema formula in general with hell ride larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set up and there are many obvious reasons for this he hasn't got a story to tell  or at least not a very interesting one  but <UNK> tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists loads of gratuitous and very women <UNK> sleaze overlong and <UNK> dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence the plot looks complex but can actually be <UNK> in one sentence the ancient <UNK> between two <UNK> biker gangs <UNK> up again with the arrival of a new member a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double crossing <UNK> that got executed back in 1976 that's it seriously all the rest going from <UNK> gang members over to the <UNK> of old <UNK> members over to <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> girl is all completely pointless and confusing padding material another major problem in hell ride is larry <UNK> very own tremendous and seemingly <UNK> ego he definitely shouldn't have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow minded especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie granted bishop starred in a couple of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies like the savage seven and angel <UNK> but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn't any good as an actor maybe it simply was <UNK> life long dream to play a character that always <UNK> his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually <UNK> and just wrote a whole screenplay around it the veterans in the cast like dennis hopper and michael madsen don't really bother to leave a plausible impression and i can't say i blame them this whole production is lame and pathetic and i can't bring myself to <UNK> it to anyone regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked <UNK>
<START> i don't see that much wrong with this movie granted the principal singers might not be <UNK> pavarotti and maria but they can certainly carry a tune burt <UNK> and hal david are talented <UNK> and i happen to love their songs especially the world is a circle the things that i will not miss and question me an answer some people claim that <UNK> <UNK> choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic i disagree on both counts i've seen <UNK> snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me and most of all in this film's defense it is appropriate for a family audience at least i remember it being that way when i saw it on christmas day a few years ago with all the <UNK> over sex and violence in the cinema these days i find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its g rating and they don't say that naughty f word every ten minutes like some films i've seen thank god so although this film may not be everyone's cup of tea it does have some redeeming value and i give it ten points out of a possible ten that's my story and i'm sticking to it
<START> hands down the best drama comedy show on television a cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too <UNK> lauren graham struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path which through out the show is becoming harder and harder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of <UNK> which surprises them both with the help of luke danes scott <UNK> and <UNK> st james melissa mccarthy and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters this show easily remains one of my favorites what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there s no real hard core sex what do people mean by hard core sex the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring <UNK> <UNK> and big john holmes well anyway this is really poor film i doubt if i <UNK> ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film the script is really poor and <UNK> the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non <UNK> it truly is an absolutely awful film you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it s about the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their <UNK> and a giant <UNK> comes along and <UNK> them yes you read that right a film set in roman times has a scene with a head <UNK> giant <UNK> br br trivia point many years ago a pirate copy of the thing 1982 version was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of <UNK> meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of <UNK> of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts this led people who d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant well that s what you get for renting pirate videos but having seen the whole of <UNK> i don t know what it meant either
<START> i'm thinking of some things for this movie first really is a very bad movie this is really <UNK> the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat maybe the original idea was good but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty my advise is don't waste 2 hours of your precious time you have been warned this is the first movie i rated 1 star at imdb com second none of the characters are likable you really don't care what happened to them third the villain is very easy to identify the <UNK> kills his father <UNK> the friend's son get the maid pregnant <UNK> his grandfather like <UNK> says if you like evil with no <UNK> this is your movie nothing more to say
<START> a wounded <UNK> standing alone to protect three innocent lives a <UNK> woman a deadly plot racial tension smart indians br br these are things we rarely if ever saw in the tv series but this movie adds them all into the mix while this is most certainly a lone ranger movie it mixes up the formula just enough that those who grew tired of the series would probably still enjoy it definitely recommended for any fan
<START> what is wrong with american movies these days <UNK> keeps making movies that have men acting like women and women acting like men the idiotic male director and writer of this movie need to have their heads examined the main problems with this film are its overt extreme feminist portrayals of the <UNK> br br in the scenes of the bar eva <UNK> and her friend are <UNK> from the beer <UNK> like you may find sailors on an oil <UNK> doing so at a bar in <UNK> <UNK> continually kisses every girl she sees after that she also dresses <UNK> in every scene yet <UNK> like a guy she gets very emotional when she fights with will smith for a while while trying to all women from bad guys everywhere br br the men are no better in this movie what we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything they can to win a date the males in this movie are concerned with getting either sexual <UNK> or unable to speak clearly when face to face with a woman men in real life do not behave this way br br what we see in this movie is a product of culture gone awry everything is flip <UNK> guys act like girls girls act like guys all this is done while keeping the extreme <UNK> of the <UNK> very much a part of the story men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in sex most of the time while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as a <UNK> for their emotional <UNK> br br this movie would be good if it wasn't presented <UNK> to the audience the content is not the <UNK> it is the manner in which the content is presented
<START> spoilers looking for a little more excitement then seeing <UNK> being fed at the local game <UNK> sisters grace and pat diana glenn together with <UNK> boyfriend adam andy decide to take a trip <UNK> in the desolate and deserted of human australian <UNK> br br with their swamp guide jimmy ben at the <UNK> of his <UNK> boat the four get by a giant <UNK> crocodile who quickly grabs and drags a terrified jimmy down to the bottom along with him grace pat adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with pat hanging on for dear life on the boat the rest of the film has the hungry and determined crocodile play a cat and mouse or and human game with the trio that ends in a showdown at a mud bank just where the dead and <UNK> body of jimmy finally came to it's rest br br both the director and actors in the film take full advantage of the swamp making it at times far more scary then the giant crocodile swimming in it we get to see the killer crocodile just about a half dozen times in the movie but everyone of them hits you and jimmy grace pat adam right in the gut br br <UNK> there were kept in suspense by the giant <UNK> always doing his damage from beneath that comes so unexpectedly that it the <UNK> attacks has far more effect when you don't see them coming then like in the last ten minutes of the movie when you do you wonder right from the start who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them the ending with the crocodile <UNK> human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film br br the crocodile who was both so <UNK> and effective in the earlier scenes seemed to have <UNK> or <UNK> himself out not having either the strength or speed to grab with his deadly jaws and finish off the sole survivor of the expedition in fact the killer <UNK> was so <UNK> that even after he his victim or victims he just couldn't hold on to them this in the end turned out to be fatal on his part br br a lot like jaws the film black water has the killer crocodile like the great white shark in jaws more interested is killing his human prey then eating them with all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the <UNK> grace pat adam jimmy for <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> that he felt was the grand <UNK> of and for daring to do that they were to pay with their lives
<START> it does not surprise me that this short <UNK> minutes b w movie that was made 50 years ago in the soviet union during the short period called or the <UNK> has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world it is sublime and beautifully filmed some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time <UNK> camera work and creative <UNK> were included in the text books and widely <UNK> the film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by <UNK> war but <UNK> alive in the memory of a young woman it is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for it is about forgiveness and about hope the film received absolutely <UNK> the grand <UNK> at cannes film festival and <UNK> was chosen as a <UNK> of a special award at cannes for playing <UNK> the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie after <UNK> with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent br br for me the movie is very personal and dear because i was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning i walked the same streets <UNK> and bridges over the river every family in the former soviet union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to <UNK> cold and <UNK> during wwii and my family is not exception my mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of <UNK> not just from the movies and the books <UNK> are flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply it is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life my background my memory and my past
<START> this is a fair movie good for one off viewing the plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a <UNK> surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flick br br the <UNK> <UNK> are hilarious a <UNK> giant and a blatantly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hand <UNK> <UNK> on a bit of wire br br definitely to watch once for <UNK> entertainment value br br 5 10
<START> this film follows a very similar <UNK> to the warriors only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about br br the story in general is not that bad based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another <UNK> girl they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re written it but as mentioned above with not nearly as much intensity br br the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down br br this film has nothing on once were warriors br br low budget alright story poor acting nothing to write home about
<START> this is unique in films of hitchcock's that i've seen in that i didn't really enjoy it br br in fact i actually found this quite predictable and annoying br br cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple he's the kind of lovable rogue character that you've seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as i am concerned br br in fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausible br br unable to hold down a job and trying to live an <UNK> lifestyle grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back br br fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is <UNK> for and presumably what her late father was worth br br average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date
<START> let's get things straight i was raised catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home that was useful for two things to make a convinced <UNK> out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the church and its <UNK> and i say if a catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he can report it to the police even if the murderer has <UNK> to him afterwards he can not reveal what he's told in confession but he can talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut so here we have a movie entirely <UNK> on a lie and another lie is there's no <UNK> for murder according to the catholic church there's <UNK> for any sin as long as there's sincere <UNK> so far the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller br br as people frequently say this movie would have improved if bob <UNK> and alan bates had switched roles <UNK> is naturally suitable to play gangsters i will never <UNK> enough that he lost al <UNK> in favor of one of de <UNK> weakest performances in the <UNK> and <UNK> features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past but above that i think the film would have been much better had real life <UNK> native liam neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played mickey <UNK> part not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but he'd make us believe the character as real something rourke just can't back in the 80s rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like brad <UNK> who's as good as the director he works with and as a former ira terrorist <UNK> acting comes across more like a <UNK> sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when neeson achieved <UNK> celebrity status in 1990 with sam <UNK> enjoyable darkman and <UNK> in 1993 with <UNK> list while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has been liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of but just can't carry this movie along as the lead yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable fare br br ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer bill <UNK> worked for me i didn't find it overly melodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful it reminded me of howard <UNK> score for the silence of the <UNK> here's to mike talent who made get carter yes but don't forget he's the mastermind behind flash gordon as well br br it seems the film was <UNK> in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just don't <UNK> and a director's cut is waiting to see the light ok but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there 4 10
<START> i first saw all the rivers run on tv when i was a kid and loved it it was great seeing a mini series that was set and filmed in a place so close to home living fairly close to i loved going to the historic <UNK> to see the <UNK> <UNK> the first one i ever had a ride on was the philadelphia in the movie i love how it takes its time to let the events unfold nothing feels rushed as most movies are today the acting was fantastic all the rivers run was perfectly cast and i just love the crew of the philadelphia mac is always amusing to watch with his trademark raw <UNK> <UNK> after a big night out easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini series of all time along with the <UNK>
<START> just saw 'the league of gentlemen at a special screening in <UNK> with mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of the league in <UNK> br br at the back was peter kay who has a brief cameo in the film <UNK> <UNK> at the back during the q a session after the film br br the film was complicated in a good way and very very funny it follows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as they try and save fictional <UNK> from the <UNK> of their creators br br the league play a wide range of their characters and themselves or character based on themselves and are <UNK> supported by the cream of british character and comedy actors such as bernard hill victoria wood and david warner br br warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in <UNK> br br the film <UNK> in and out of various realities and allows some of the <UNK> of <UNK> some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy <UNK> br br steve <UNK> has a great moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a <UNK> to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters br br this echoes something mark and <UNK> said in the q a afterwards that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is <UNK> and that the whole film is really a love letter to them br br for a format that started as a radio character based sketch show these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction <UNK> comedy tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations br br the fans of the show will love it it pays off dedication and attention to detail in <UNK> the <UNK> may be a little lost but the joy of the <UNK> was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their <UNK> observed characters and take the <UNK> leap into farce and <UNK> movie homage br br there are <UNK> a plenty in this one including 'the <UNK> and <UNK> belle et la to name but two i spotted and they <UNK> demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in england that makes perfect sense when you're engaged with the movie br br what can i say i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at a successful british tv comedy to cinema translation br br if you've watched and enjoyed 'the league of <UNK> in the past go see it you will enjoy br br if you haven't rent buy a dvd and then go see it br br well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous q a
<START> this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half few movies can actually give me chill <UNK> this one did few horror movie give me a sense of dread this one did it kept me guessing i cared about the story i cared about the characters the acting was decent unfortunately about half way through the movie the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self <UNK> it does what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters the story concludes with disappointment while this movie seems complete there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel the movie isn't good enough for a sequel this movie is worth seeing in the theater just don't expect to be stunned this is best suited as a movie to rent it's probably not a movie you'd want to own
<START> i'm assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but frankly this movie is truly <UNK> i was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending you cannot take issues like this so lightly without knowing the final <UNK> of the movie we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2 hours as he tries to establish a new life you cannot have sympathy for a character who does this cannot not to mention we're given nothing until the last say 1 2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie as to why this guy is suffering so much no flashbacks no sudden reactions to noise or movement stuff that real vets are suffering from all we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't <UNK> take care of her and his 3 kids there really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current iraq vets are going through br br additionally the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score its a catastrophe it is truly <UNK> to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times joe <UNK> it <UNK> everything you're supposed to feel and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely again this was a brutal thing this guy did and so seeing him get a new job meet a new blonde struggle behind the counter making <UNK> is not appropriate and really the ending what a <UNK> cop out how dare you br br there are far <UNK> films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers please don't bother with this one
<START> does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this i have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere probably because it was only on video and they never made the dvd or vhs or <UNK> br br i saw this right off disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie if anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like 50 bucks or something please call <UNK> thank you
<START> valley girl is the definitive 1980's movie with catch phrases <UNK> throughout this wonderfully acted movie the characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual day in the life of any high school usa this flick is to the 1980's what the brady bunch tv series is to the 1970's if you don't like it well then gag me with a <UNK>
<START> although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch you are alone held my attention and was <UNK> honest in its dialog it truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships in addition the soundtrack was amazing the lyrics and the tone of the songs <UNK> the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie br br jessica is the best actress i have ever watched her compelling and believable performance made the movie it made me wonder if she really is a prostitute who knows anyway the movie was very worth seeing love your sister yeah that's right
<START> howard <UNK> kevin kline is a teacher who is about to get married then one of his former students wins an oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks howard in his acceptance speech outing him as being gay too this film follows the aftermath as <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight br br i love this movie kevin kline is wonderful it has some really hilarious moments and it always leaves me feeling great with an enormous grin on my face consequently it's one film that i enjoy watching as often as possible if you haven't seen it you're missing out
<START> in one of the many bugs bunny <UNK> duck cartoons elmer <UNK> is out hunting and <UNK> tries to get him to shoot bugs needless to say bugs has his own agenda moreover rabbit <UNK> makes interesting use of word order and warning it just might hilariously and <UNK> mess up your speech br br i think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by bugs and <UNK> one of them seems like it would have been <UNK> for <UNK> especially in a cartoon but they pull it off perfectly as they always did all in all this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were
<START> destroy all planets winds up <UNK> for all by film's end as a space monster resembling a giant <UNK> falls to the <UNK> <UNK> known as gamera actually gamera is saving earth right from the get go knocking out space ship 1 even before the first set of film credits roll the scene switches to a japanese <UNK> camp where we meet a pair of <UNK> young heroes jim and who take part in <UNK> exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and <UNK> aboard their ship in an <UNK> bubble shield br br it's pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be <UNK> previously boy genius had <UNK> the unit to run in reverse direction of it's controls but dr <UNK> didn't think about checking that out as a possibility at least that prepared the boys for <UNK> with the alien space <UNK> controls by playing <UNK> with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> br br when boss alien says the hang on to your seats for <UNK> footage from earlier gamera movies where he battles and <UNK> these take up quite a bit of screen time but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it for the longest time addressed an invisible crew and when they finally appeared they were <UNK> who could fly imagine that br br seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are gamera drawing blood comes to mind and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated when <UNK> <UNK> started <UNK> from the <UNK> bodies i made a connection to the <UNK> films having the individual <UNK> <UNK> to form the giant was a neat device br br i guess the appeal for young kids might <UNK> in <UNK> with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster move around pretty <UNK> on an alien space ship and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien <UNK> technology seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults it could have been a simple case of wish <UNK>
<START> this documentary is absolutely fantastic i was really <UNK> that you can make with so less money such amazing fx especially the scenes of the birth of the babies or the sad story of the big flying dinosaur were wonderful and breathtaking well the only flaw was it was to short
<START> i normally like casper in his movies a real credit to starship troopers but the box cover on this video <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> at my local video people rent it expecting a perhaps <UNK> like vampire and instead they get a bad re make of <UNK> <UNK> it had great potential and fell very flat <UNK> think i could have written a better story line and screen play why is it in every science fiction movie they the cast constantly refers to a <UNK> system as a galaxy didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class it is a pet of mine but a <UNK> system is a single star with planets a galaxy is a whole bunch of <UNK> systems it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs makes it sound even dumber
<START> like most other reviewers i really enjoyed this tv miniseries i didn't see it when it first came out but my grandfather a big fan of mysteries and war films happened to record it in 1989 i remember watching it at my <UNK> cabin one night and i was completely drawn into the story it has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama romance and espionage i've seen lots of films that are set during wwii but none with a twist like this thankfully i was able to make a vhs copy of the film several years ago i've watched it several times since then and i still enjoy it i would love for this film to be released on dvd it would be so much easier to view with chapters
<START> i first rented this movie on the infamous day of september 11 2001 since then i've seen it a number of times my only complaint is that it's too short would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours as it stands the running time is only an hour and a half br br ex twisted sister member dee <UNK> wrote produced and stars in this 1998 set in a small <UNK> town he plays <UNK> a crazed <UNK> who has psychotic <UNK> on human evolution and a love for near death experiences is no <UNK> he's a <UNK> up six foot modern primitive someone who has <UNK> and <UNK> their body to the very extreme when he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sight br br main <UNK> in life is to share his spiritual <UNK> with his kidnapped victims he visits internet <UNK> under the name capt <UNK> and then invites people over to his house they believe they're going to a party instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering <UNK> their eyes and mouths shut and <UNK> them by sticking <UNK> and <UNK> in numerous parts of their body if it sounds sick it's because it is br br one of victims is <UNK> the <UNK> daughter of detective michael gage gage not only manages to save her but <UNK> as well four years later is released from a mental institution completely <UNK> to the <UNK> of the community a group of <UNK> led by freddy krueger himself actor robert englund decide to kill him they fail and <UNK> back to his old self br br the rest of the film i'll leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in <UNK> with the exception of <UNK> the acting isn't too good but it's <UNK> the direction is okay too there are some humorous parts in and they are very funny i also loved the soundtrack it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock overall this is a movie worth watching if you love low budget horror films with a sense of humor check it out you'll probably like it
<START> undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever balance of terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense with intelligent real world parallels the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the us and the soviet union during the cold war spot on characterizations and the introduction of star <UNK> second most important hostile alien race after the <UNK> the <UNK> br br after receiving a distress call from a <UNK> <UNK> the enterprise is dangerously close to the neutral zone which if crossed would lead to open conflict with the <UNK> although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh soon enough a <UNK> appears carrying a new weapon and a device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat facing the threat of <UNK> <UNK> kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the commander mark to ensure the survival of his crew unfortunately the task is made more difficult when one of the men <UNK> spock of being in league with the enemy due to the physical resemblance between <UNK> and <UNK> two races that are in fact related a fact that is quite ironic with <UNK> given went on to play <UNK> father starting with season 2 br br always very critical when it came to the subject of war star trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic although the <UNK> aren't actually based on the <UNK> the name is actually taken from <UNK> the <UNK> of rome the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear american and russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons that fear gave birth to the titular concept of balance of terror but even without the subtext this remains an essential episode due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two <UNK> which <UNK> into a duel between shatner and no need to say who wins
<START> this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other henry may long is a very well acted <UNK> lit depressing turn of the century period piece about a friendship between a <UNK> ill man and a melancholy <UNK> <UNK> talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea and all the crying wears thin recommended if you like independent <UNK> intellectual slow paced <UNK> <UNK> type features br br i suspected that the main characters were in love but their connection was so <UNK> it didn't really have the emotional impact of mountain ' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life but it is truly a dark and depressing film
<START> this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever guest is truly talented he has a gift for humor i almost died laughing actually when i saw this in theaters i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb and this is a really good combination you will be laughing from start to end br br this <UNK> style film follows an array of characters all competing at the <UNK> club dog show the cast includes parker posey fred <UNK> eugene levy catherine o'hara john michael michael larry miller bob <UNK> jennifer <UNK> and tons more br br this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing someone born without a personality would laugh at this film it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity best in show 5 5
<START> it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me something similar happened with <UNK> of <UNK> but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate an exchange student from japan immediately started laughing at the movie saying that it sounded dumb now i don't agree that it is dumb the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time br br but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me it has an interesting message about and greed but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning especially because you already knew it anyway the sound effects while the man is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for example are indeed repulsive br br there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the out of his <UNK> but it goes on for so long that it seems to <UNK> everything else there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it br br as i said about <UNK> of <UNK> this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim or its japanese counterpart but an academy award nominated film it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from
<START> <UNK> might just be the most incoherent and <UNK> scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few <UNK> qualities like fantastic gore effects an <UNK> musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn't make one <UNK> of sense but who cares when linda blair with an <UNK> <UNK> portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david <UNK> depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo <UNK> shut lips upside down <UNK> vicious <UNK> and an <UNK> but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of <UNK> the young couple is there to investigate the <UNK> dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his <UNK> are considers re opening the hotel and the <UNK> female architect simply <UNK> along for casual sex they're forced to stay the night in the <UNK> hotel and then suddenly the previous <UNK>  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of <UNK> jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an <UNK> spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there's something <UNK> morbid and unsettling about staring at a <UNK> woman hanging upside down a <UNK> and waiting to get fried
<START> well i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday for my dad the film is so harmless and <UNK> it suits all ages much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion and i used to work in the disney store the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the <UNK> wedding especially the musical talents of <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> and the amazing night club scene the musical numbers still have me <UNK> 20 years after i first watched it there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby sitting and in fact every child i know thanks to my loving parents have seen this film many times it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant <UNK> and over all originality
<START> i saw on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the is a great <UNK> for teaching and for simply helping each other set in the early 60s with the civil rights issues <UNK> <UNK> and all that came with the 60s it is forgotten that the peace <UNK> and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the <UNK> that be the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves maybe hopefully see this film
<START> than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie would've lasted a bit longer but it would've been worth it at least for me br br casting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable <UNK> br br not much more to say really but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious br br
<START> is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects however it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story along with a magnificent cinematography the narrative structure is set around two narrative <UNK> one of them the other each one having elements that relate and co exist in excellent harmony the story never loses the right pacing and it shows a very good <UNK> of the human figure with its natural environment which is a character in itself the acting is great and for that we owe credit to the <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> furthermore the characters are very well written and masterfully complex so once you become <UNK> with them you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything i can't say i liked this picture because of all the hype it generated in <UNK> but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you <UNK> with the <UNK> of people's lives hopefully will establish a reference for future projects in <UNK> as it is a very good example of nice movie making
<START> this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a <UNK> things about women the universe the better life the terrible <UNK> of the brilliant architect from manhattan who all <UNK> with everyone including his three years old child which may seem irresponsible to some actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to <UNK> and the scene with his old school pal which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the <UNK> in a desert movie br br the scene with the father who left home when i was a child has been told and told and told of course it did not prevent the <UNK> from making his way of life and when you see the hero's wife's attitude you may think she must never have heard about woman's <UNK> br br the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson tom waits or bonnie <UNK> but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work
<START> this is my opinion of this movie expressed in its dialogs br br to be more serious i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either br br first i was simply indifferent couldn't get my mind into the apes world even though the make up are very realistic the constant screaming was irritating may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my <UNK> of the latter br br the second part is more interesting with the talent and <UNK> of then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but i felt <UNK> all the story is located in a big british mansion no matter how <UNK> is it it was like a prison for me br br at last it could be a good adaptation of the <UNK> story of tarzan i don't know having never read the book or seen the disney br br in conclusion i don't have any good moments to remember so one viewing would be enough for me br br i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called <UNK> at the beginning what's the meaning only the director knows it
<START> though the our gang comedies still have their followers i've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films courtesy of hal roach came up way short why did roach have to pick the civil war as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow br br dashing southern <UNK> phillips holmes takes in young orphan <UNK> <UNK> and his young black friend <UNK> thomas after <UNK> inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a <UNK> all is <UNK> and <UNK> in the old south and then the civil war comes to ruin it for everybody br br but even children can charm the worst in the world and there's none worse than those damn <UNK> they just come south and ruin it for everybody br br criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint gone with the wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though <UNK> which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters <UNK> <UNK> would not have won her oscar if it were not so <UNK> <UNK> character of <UNK> as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension br br here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in hollywood the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> does show that kids get along racial feelings are acquired not <UNK> it's not the of the blacks that's <UNK> but there total acceptance of it right from that horrible <UNK> song sung over the title credits the message of general <UNK> is a bad one br br yet it did get an oscar nomination for sound recording probably one of the very few hal roach ever got out of the short subject field br br general <UNK> is far from gone with the wind though
<START> although is 15 years old tonight was my first time ever seeing it i had heard about the movie but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period well i caught it on one of the <UNK> channels and i must say that it was very good br br this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him her back to life besides the all star cast this movie had some serious bite to it just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough but i really thought the writer director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view this was no generic attempt to thrill <UNK> and make one's mind race this was the real deal br br instead of making it an empty superficial star <UNK> thriller this movie had substance a nail <UNK> white <UNK> edge of the seat hard nose thriller i give it an 8 10
<START> i saw this back in 99 and i remember loving it still to this day i can remember parts of the movie in my head like the <UNK> pitch unfortunately from 99 now i could never remember the name of this until i was looking through the filmography of a friend of my <UNK> and came across this he played clive straight away after reading the description i knew what it was after catching up i was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or dvd but still has yet to be repeated this is a massive shame i am begging you <UNK> at least repeat this superb tv movie nick <UNK> showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character mike this is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren't too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated movie deserves to be repeated or released on video dvd so <UNK> myself and other fans of this movie beg you please consider one of those
<START> mike <UNK> <UNK> is an interesting film and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see br br before i start the review i would <UNK> it by saying that if you get a chance to see it definitely do as it is worth watching and isn't the <UNK> film in the world to track down br br let's start with the premise luke wilson is private joe an army <UNK> who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws making him totally average in every way this along with the fact that he has no living relatives makes him a standout candidate for an experimental <UNK> also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was <UNK> to the project by her abusive <UNK> unfortunately a few days after they are frozen the top secret project is abandoned and they are forgotten about br br they wake up in and find that with the <UNK> down of society following the <UNK> of recent times everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a <UNK> the way that <UNK> joe talks is seen as being much as someone speaking like shakespeare would <UNK> now and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states actually this one probably isn't that outrageous really the best show on tv is called <UNK> my balls which admittedly sounds pretty good and not only is everything spelled wrong but signs seem to have run out of space for the <UNK> leaving them to be <UNK> up at the end br br it's a funny premise for film but this is the problem aside from the initial premise not that much in the movie is truly funny what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself obviously it's not terrible but it probably could have been funnier br br there are some winners in the script such as <UNK> now offering happy endings and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood <UNK> but they are just too few and far between so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future <UNK> out a slack <UNK> profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and or intelligence then the laughs might be pretty well <UNK> br br it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space because it's a very different film but as a film regardless of what came before it <UNK> is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15 20 minutes than in the rest of the film br br i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road
<START> caution possible spoilers just watched <UNK> for the second time the first time was 30 years ago on an air force base i was reminded of that by the air force <UNK> with tech sgt <UNK> wore by the boyfriend dealer we <UNK> had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a rank over the years i have carried several other images from the film foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive as someone else commented you could not take you eyes off her i did not realize until now that this was a 20 year old susan sarandon in her first movie what a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that i also recall the irony of having a <UNK> hero like peter boyle playing the title role of a right wing gun nut not unlike george c scott playing <UNK> in dr <UNK> and <UNK> and of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression br br 30 years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base we thought it was a great film then and i have been reluctant to see it again because i was afraid that it would be as <UNK> dated as easy rider but watching it today i was amazed at how well the film has held up it is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the <UNK> when sarandon gets in with him br br searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining i have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting boyle was physically believable as joe as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the <UNK> <UNK> character a few later did ted knight model his character judge after the dennis <UNK> advertising executive in <UNK> they look alike and sound alike patrick was totally believable as the wrapped too tight upper middle class executive and <UNK> <UNK> eyed innocent with the ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers perfect casting br br the nude and drug scenes actually hold up they were very provocative for their day and are as explicit as anything to be found in about the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic <UNK> was about the same time as 'the wild <UNK> and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change br br another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the <UNK> of the theme and context of this film in the film both types of are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the <UNK> and filled with envy at their free and <UNK> lifestyle the <UNK> is portrayed as mocking the straight culture and although paranoid toward <UNK> <UNK> so given that this was just a couple months after kent state they cannot resist <UNK> their lifestyle in an attempt to the political landscape is not all that different 30 years later i'm not sure <UNK> envy young people and <UNK> as much as 1970 but they fear and hate them more br br an excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970's
<START> when someone refers to the independent cinema realm in the united states it's often <UNK> that it means the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted this today is not really always the case unless someone is a solid auteur and creative freedom still comes with the <UNK> that one has to find distribution with one of the independent <UNK> of major studios or by getting picked up somehow for some kind of low level deal at a worthwhile film festival but robert downey film about a tough as nails african american accidentally promoted to head advertising guru at a production company is independent cinema the kind of work that went right along with the likes or romero's night of the living dead and cassavetes faces at the same time of getting no real typical studio distribution but causing waves kicking ass and taking names in the cinema world for all its moments that are rough and crude it's unforgettable br br it's also a film that is funny very and excruciatingly funny sometimes the sense of humor is just so ridiculous it's nearly impossible not to laugh from the mere appearance of the president with his wife to lines of dialog from the <UNK> team puts together like i can't eat an air <UNK> in a real soul voice it is as smart as the audience it is aiming at which is anyone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work isn't offensive or too shocking because it's meant to <UNK> the cage and it does this pretty well in the first five minutes once that's past downey sr goes on his <UNK> of sorts as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose his protagonist is part <UNK> castro part <UNK> hayes circa 1972 and yes it's 1969 in the film and part hard <UNK> ad <UNK> with a firing streak to make mr on the <UNK> look kind and don't forget those side characters dear god br br there's so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track from maybe the most hilarious <UNK> assassination attempt in any movie to the one ad for face off skin cream that includes lines that would give south park a run for its dirty mouth money to just little <UNK> with the one guy from jack <UNK> movies playing the muslim who keeps giving lip to and that one boy with the the nun who <UNK> up a storm and <UNK> in a swift stroke it's a pretty direct message about media and advertising but there's also a lot of powerful moments where it just hits the nail on the head about racism in america sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with doing something huge like having black <UNK> types going this way and that around advertising regime and for a low budget production i mean super low hence the comparison to night of the living dead and faces downey got some really good actors all non union and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera here br br it should be mentioned that <UNK> style doesn't make it perfect it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good and i'm sure i didn't get some of the underlying humor of a couple of the ads since i'm from a full generation after these ads were aired albeit the miss redneck jersey was definitely not lost on me in general though this is one of the finest of its time period a satire that <UNK> and a feature with a <UNK> black cast that is all too knowing of what comes from an excess of power regardless of skin color it is as someone might say good s
<START> this film did entertain me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving along in all types of crazy directions if you like suggestive language and sexy looking <UNK> they were all in the picture and <UNK> and guys all looking burned out before they even graduate from high school there is one scene where the teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it out into a lake or ocean which is repeated over and over again there is no horror to this film except the word horrible for the entire picture and arnold who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character please don't waste your time viewing this film
<START> believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious the basic story is about <UNK> <UNK> who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all he can about life <UNK> has to be one of the <UNK> to relate to characters ever made he takes everything to the extreme and it's just laugh out loud funny every time from his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters br br one of the funniest things about this show is simply constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions he spends a great amount of time in various super <UNK> <UNK> like dragon half or other times in less then 0 1 seconds his face will turn not just serious but manga fighter style life or death expressions like a weight <UNK> trying to a new record it's hilarious br br if that wasn't enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better english <UNK> is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an <UNK> series it practically <UNK> the word if you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie you'll love this br br com
<START> sorry folks but all of you that say this is a great documentary and that award it won at sundance well you've all been <UNK> i've heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it maybe in 1999 when it came out and reality tv didn't have such a <UNK> presence in the industry this movie would have seemed entertaining but mike and mark are so obviously playing themselves mike and mark at times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the <UNK> but mostly they do not ring true they are the reality version of jay and silent bob yes the people are real they are not actors but it's put on it's exaggeration of themselves and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe so many people think it's the real deal i wasn't fooled so it was actually a tad boring mildly amusing but not missing much if you miss it
<START> this film was nothing more than exploitative gay <UNK> it was not an art movie just an excuse to show several gratuitous exploitative over the top scenes with extensive male <UNK> nudity there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men the camera <UNK> in on the men's <UNK> and <UNK> as they are portrayed for several minutes with their <UNK> in full screen view there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously i was wondering if i was watching a <UNK> video by mistake if these same scenes were filmed using women ex totally naked and showing their <UNK> repeatedly it would be quickly <UNK> as just <UNK> porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy which is all that this film is any artistic merit got <UNK> down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality the themes of class distinction homosexuality longing desire etc were simple and superficial no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead
<START> that's how i was when i walked <UNK> out of this film i couldn't leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trapped br br the tiny <UNK> of original footage which attempted to <UNK> this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense br br <UNK> cinematography was hideous <UNK> of disjointed framing and some of the <UNK> lighting i've witnessed br br as for the stock footage well at first one br br wait br br why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please don't watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry
<START> this film offers you a fascinating trip through one of the most <UNK> cities of today <UNK> and its musicians do not expect a <UNK> of turkish <UNK> or anything like that alexander a german musician and member of the cult band travels to <UNK> to get to know the music scene his sparse voice overs of what he experiences are a <UNK> line through the film but mainly german turkish director faith akin lets various artists from <UNK> do the talking and of course their music br br you meet a variety of personalities big stars and street musicians young and old people playing many different musical styles but this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of <UNK> it also draws a compelling picture of <UNK> today and how turkey has <UNK> ahead in the last decade the film <UNK> its protagonists with subtle humour but never without respect all of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power br br akin again shows his talent to portray diversity <UNK> when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes after his award winning feature film <UNK> die <UNK> head on faith akin proves with crossing the bridge that he is equally able to touch entertain and guide his audience in a documentary if you have never been in <UNK> you will want to go there after having seen the film
<START> each show is excellent finally a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people shame it got canceled br br mike <UNK> and julie <UNK> of the simpsons wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour <UNK> in here take officer steve cox and think <UNK> <UNK> however it does come with its own unique brand of humour and let's face it a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alone br br what is it with television that <UNK> most good shows and we are <UNK> fed with such <UNK> as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called please learn a lesson not everything has to be about <UNK> or romantic <UNK> or especially reality shows on how to <UNK> every aspect of life some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward well my <UNK> is done for the day now back to the simpsons when is it on oh yes all the time
<START> i honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as ernest goes to africa aside from two or three good laughs <UNK> throughout the film there is nothing positive about this hour and a half waste of time and life it is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act film and edit this piece of trash and even more incredible that this is the <UNK> installment in the ernest series br br during the opening credits of the movie we see ernest posing next to various african objects such as wooden masks and the heads of african animals making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd <UNK> laugh this opening scene gives the viewer a taste of <UNK> frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95 of the time br br the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is everyone in the film is a typical c movie actor but linda stands out as especially terrible she is the epitome of overacting all of her lines are delivered with shockingly <UNK> enthusiasm that you'd find only in a middle school play most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance jim <UNK> at least displays some comedic ability every now and then but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete <UNK> trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices br br ernest goes to africa begins in africa where an <UNK> has stolen two priceless gems from an african tribe the gems then make their way back to the united states where an <UNK> man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market he hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items and then runs from the scene ernest is looking for a gift to buy for <UNK> a waitress he likes so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems he later takes them back to his house paints them and <UNK> them together to make a <UNK> <UNK> he gives the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average and she wants a man of adventure <UNK> and ernest are <UNK> down by the henchmen and are then brought to africa to be kept as prisoners br br most of the movie really doesn't make sense once ernest is in africa he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river in the next scene we see him as a <UNK> servant named hey you his skin is dark and he is wearing a <UNK> cloth at first i thought jim <UNK> was playing another role in the film in addition to ernest but i immediately recognized <UNK> idiocy once hey you began to speak br br another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the african wilderness <UNK> and ernest have taken an <UNK> <UNK> truck and are being chased by the henchmen driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road both henchmen are shooting at ernest who is in the back of the <UNK> <UNK> truck ernest on the other hand is throwing <UNK> eggs at the henchmen and their driver the henchmen never hit ernest once during the five minute chase but ernest is able to <UNK> them off by hitting them and their driver in the face making their car <UNK> off the road and explode in a giant <UNK> of smoke i should also add that ernest is the eggs two at a time from a large <UNK> br br the set design is also incredibly poor in this movie there is a large portion of the film in which <UNK> and ernest are walking in africa trying to find civilization during their <UNK> we see them walking through fields and <UNK> which probably could have been shot anywhere in the united states the fields are simply plain fields with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near africa they could have at least <UNK> added some african trees in the background and the <UNK> look like the woods of rural <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hanging from trees according to imdb com the film was actually shot in south africa but i still wouldn't believe that at all br br the movie goes on and on ernest joke after ernest joke the rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either the african <UNK> all speak english for some reason and ernest is later challenged to a battle of truth by the lead henchman who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage <UNK> the henchman has a table of <UNK> swords knives and before him while ernest has a table with a <UNK> a teddy bear and a few other worthless items however ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day br br overall this movie is painful to watch i couldn't handle it in one sitting i had to stop halfway through and do something <UNK> for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate humor they should really put a <UNK> general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie i would have to say that out of all the movies i have ever seen none comes close to being as <UNK> as ernest goes to africa
<START> if you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was i probably would have left most of this out but i am a fan and as any fan i visit the movies sites often well when super troopers came out i visited that site after the release on dvd and was hooked <UNK> it's a difficult site to stay on but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together what a story this company comedy <UNK> has begging people to come and see there movies on street <UNK> <UNK> anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years they crap on it and decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans but the worst thing about it they didn't tell any of them they just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are you know the same fans they <UNK> years ago still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with super troopers and got <UNK> attention and thank god for that because after that they have sucked with everything else good for you guys way to go mainstream just remember when you realize your material isn't that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who <UNK> the original ones away fans make you who you are not the other way around never burn your bridges
<START> ok lets start with the best the building although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting other than that its not worth it br br as far as the bad its done by wwe films wtf is that supposed to make you want to see it if anything stay away horrible horrible idea for them to make movies and allow gregory dark to direct it bad choice the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining br br i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is <UNK> actors a disappointing vague storyline apparently many of the actors are from that show all saints its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show other than that the bus driver which you never even see just him closing the door has had more action that just about everyone together at least he handles stunts for some decent films br br i like to see scary movies i really do but this one blew so much the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through very annoying the child behind me was more during the previews of other horror films br br this is not a film to see even less if you have to pay for it
<START> when the china syndrome was released plenty of right wing critics and pro <UNK> supporters <UNK> this film particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt <UNK> of nuclear power but it only took two weeks and a near <UNK> accident at three mile island to shut those critics up br br fonda and douglas are the l a news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the nuclear power plant douglas films the event through the <UNK> <UNK> glass but the tv station will not air the footage <UNK> a massive <UNK> it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth despite a massive attempt by the <UNK> owners to cover up the accident br br but a <UNK> shift <UNK> jack lemmon has <UNK> certain <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> support structure he believes that these <UNK> were the cause of the accident and that though it would be extremely <UNK> and lengthy if <UNK> aren't made the next accident could be apocalyptic but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political technological and human interest stories together in one disturbing package br br while obviously quite politically liberal in nature the china syndrome well directed and co written by james bridges the paper chase is also <UNK> a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together <UNK> nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect that is what the film is saying and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way it says it brilliantly
<START> following on from the huge success of nick park and the <UNK> team with the wallace and <UNK> short animations we now have the first hopefully of many feature with the <UNK> characters that so many love the dvd of the movie has proved to be the most <UNK> and best used of my two children's many christmas presents by a long way the plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the w g films for me is the background gags there are plenty of up front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy but the background is the killer for me all in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for nick park and i would recommend fans and new <UNK> to see this film often
<START> seriously people need to <UNK> up and just accept that funny is funny and this movie is f king hilarious better than the first and <UNK> really grew a pair for this film and did way more <UNK> stunts then the first if ebert and <UNK> not saying that i'm a huge fan of theirs can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to i wasn't sure what to expect from this but i was <UNK> and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original this new one i believe <UNK> the first big time so do what i did just relax kick back try not to <UNK> at some points and laugh your ass off
<START> caught this flick as one of a five for 5 deal from a local video store and it was a most pleasant surprise it's a collection of four <UNK> tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up they tell each other these stories to kill time and are occasionally <UNK> by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o henry <UNK> ending that left me <UNK> a real discovery blood and plenty of it breasts and <UNK> round it all out rather nicely <UNK> is worth the price of admission alone this one is a keeper jim bob says check it out br br oddly enough <UNK> was one of our five choices too and imdb <UNK> that for anyone who likes <UNK> tales i'll <UNK> as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one <UNK>
<START> i would say this is a background movie play it the background as your <UNK> to busy work <UNK> checking email etc i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted wrong it was done in 2009 the screenplay script is pretty awful i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along it almost seems like it's a made for tv movie based on the cinematography am i watching a tv show br br even the secretary breaks out into song what the f is going on actually she seemed to have the best voice amy adams was so great in enchanted lead actor is average disappointed for sure this movie would have been good for lifetime but that's about it
<START> there have been several books that have <UNK> this as the earliest gay cinema i don't really see this as all that gay in the homosexual sense but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the worlds first movie musical does have its attraction br br there have been several earlier comments about this film <UNK> any homosexual overtones as to those that are quick to dismiss this film as just being silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks well i've heard that story before br br this film is of interest as an <UNK> and if folks want to consider it the first gay film so be it better this than the depressing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> die
<START> <UNK> is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r <UNK> is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel <UNK> the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired <UNK> force soldier while in the film he's a teenager <UNK> has it's good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts i'm a fan of micheal <UNK> and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog <UNK> was impressive since it was well trained br br the film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked <UNK> since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would <UNK> an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the is <UNK> around killing people and <UNK> out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents they then <UNK> in the woods while the government agents and the are not far behind br br <UNK> is not a great adaptation of dean r <UNK> novel but it is a 80's horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out
<START> i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me i was watching through my fingers the whole way through so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has <UNK> michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh
<START> well as a life long fan of kung fu films i have to say this is one of the best i have ever seen sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain as does most movies of the genre this film is packed with action and does not <UNK> its viewers it's so damn fun when i watch i have a smile on my face the whole time this also has an impact on future films like kill bill many of kill <UNK> sound effects come from this film for example this is essential viewing for all knew viewers in kung fu form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better i have seen in the genre there are few kung fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film so if in search of a great kung fu movie check this one out for sure
<START> i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly <UNK> in high school which is something i never imagined her being a great flick with lots of laughs i don't usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one
<START> i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid i loved it whilst i haven't watched it recently i am sure i would enjoy it just the same today its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh the situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative i particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's <UNK> who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion the robbers and the nuns this nice humour style is much missed these days also this movie proved that actor paul <UNK> <UNK> days of our lives was off to a great start i recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop
<START> so what is one to do if you are a porno star with <UNK> looks i know become a pop star this documentary and i use the term loosely follows the trials and <UNK> of <UNK> as he tries to <UNK> himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic read dance music i only wish mr ford's voice was as muscular as his arms sorry to say his <UNK> are painfully thin there isn't much interesting going on here but mr ford and friends are eye candy br br see him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune see him travel to new york to make connections see him go back to l a with little success see yourself look in the mirror and ask why am i wasting time watching this mess
<START> exceptionally silly <UNK> with <UNK> leads in a story which would have suited a fill in issue of <UNK> the action sequences never really flow as they should leaving some cool bits <UNK> in a sea of sound and fury <UNK> nothing i really wonder how they'll release this one in the west sam lee overacts like crazy newcomer edison chan doesn't display any acting talent yet the robot is clunky and not very impressive and the cgi effects though done by us <UNK> people are ridiculous totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief i am not looking forward to gen z cops
<START> spoilers spoilers br br i saw this movie last night at a screening i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci fi the first third of the movie was very cool the score was good the cinematography was interesting the film <UNK> vision of the future was realistic yet <UNK> interesting nonetheless i remember thinking to myself this is the most intelligently done sci fi movie i've seen in a while then they just couldn't keep it together br br although from the outset there were a number of more rough around the edges issues with this film namely the editing and later some of the writing plot development these issues were forgivable they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all br br robbins could not breathe life into his character but did the best he could his female counterpart her name escapes me now was good in her role br br the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci fi movie or a futuristic love story they ended up with neither br br good br br some of the cinematography grainy it felt like 21 days later some times br br very fitting for a futuristic movie like this br br i <UNK> some of the location shots br br the music was cool br br the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting br br i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie br br some of the writing was interesting early on br br the girl who played maria <UNK> name can't recall she was good br br spoilers below br br a few questions comments br br i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a <UNK> story namely <UNK> obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically <UNK> of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could <UNK> report him for code <UNK> then they take him away and <UNK> his memory and the movie ends classic <UNK> cop out ending if you ask me ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right br br was <UNK> character naturally good as <UNK> or was it the virus br br why didn't they explore the <UNK> of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom that could have made some interesting story br br at first i like the from across the globe in everyone's speech but it became <UNK> especially since their accents were not convincing i get it the future will undoubtedly be <UNK> and <UNK> more <UNK> but it started feeling like an at t global <UNK> commercial by the end of it br br if they were how could they have gotten <UNK> for code <UNK> br br was never well defined sometimes it seemed as trivial as a <UNK> and other times it was as vital as life or death again loose <UNK> allow them to use it for <UNK> <UNK> parts of the plot together br br okay i'm starting to get to negative about it so i'll stop there were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie but that only gives it a 4 10
<START> soul <UNK> is more solid than it ever was with the new character creation and the bad ass <UNK> of the sword mode on the home version br br the <UNK> version is more complete even though the character <UNK> is smaller than the home version this version is definitely the more pretty of the two <UNK> all of the goofy unrealistic fighting styles found in the home version if you were in any way disappointed with the home version or perhaps thought it was too much you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of soul <UNK> in the <UNK> think you have what it takes to become a legend
<START> caught this recently after <UNK> james earl jones name on the title it was better than i expected of course it's pretty old made during the early mid 70's but it actually is a decent drama it runs a quick <UNK> or so and showcases good performances from james earl jones and <UNK> <UNK> the plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on <UNK> who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that <UNK> this makes for an interesting view also in the fact that the script wasn't too sentimental or <UNK> it's almost like looking at a slice of the past all the 70's styles are out in abundance the ending is kind of <UNK> though probably would've done better without the <UNK>
<START> i saw <UNK> when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as i watch a lot of foreign films in various genres you have to watch movies in their original language for sure not only is it annoying to know the voices don't belong to the actors but they always seem cheerful like the whole movie is one big long <UNK> commercial or something it makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and i have had to <UNK> a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren't as good as north american films that they aren't hollywood enough also they translation is never right it's too literal and <UNK> up the vibe of the movie even if it's basically saying the same thing i watched <UNK> by myself the other week in german then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his <UNK> and didn't want to have to miss parts when he couldn't see the subtitles because he was <UNK> 30 mins in and he <UNK> me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles he loved it both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films kelly
<START> this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage i saw capturing the <UNK> a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better br br the story is not an incredibly shocking one but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and cold war block <UNK> <UNK> the viewer through <UNK> family footage and after the fact interviews his interview style is sensitive and <UNK> and his insights are clear and <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40 50 years of social change the social <UNK> and potential for redemption
<START> as a dedicated lover of all things egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's along with my other favourite land of the <UNK> the sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so neat in the production quality i thought victor mature was well cast and peter ustinov a real gem the whole look of the movie along with others made in this era has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their <UNK> effects i have yet to see the 1999 movie the mummy but am sure i will love it br br top stuff
<START> the man with the golden arm the movie is a decent career vehicle for frank sinatra but fails <UNK> as a good adaptation of a fantastic book you always hear about how books are changed when they are made into films things are cut out <UNK> down etc well you can't even say they changed anything with the movie they just told a completely different story the characters and setting are the same sure but not the ambiguous characterization the depth of the men and women of polish chicago in the book as for the setting it's become merely a play stage complete with the unnecessary supporting role players walking all too down the claustrophobic interior exterior streets the movie is a <UNK> down completely different take on frankie machine and drug addiction when this happens frankie <UNK> all lose their psychological edge <UNK> <UNK> a modest dream in the book becomes his full passion in the movie probably because sinatra is a musician and drug addiction is treated as <UNK> the acting is decent especially the <UNK> who is more menacing in the movie than the book but it's just a shame this kind of movie can be <UNK> as a classic alongside the book it is based upon the real story of frankie machine the movie just goes to show hollywood get anything right without <UNK> it down and adding a happy ending in this case they just changed it completely an important and realistic story into hollywood fluff i'm sure as hell biased because i read the book first so i can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is i actually thought about turning the movie off and i never do that just so i wouldn't get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book but this is an overrated film and while it's not so bad the book should come first as it was the first and it should have remained the only story of division street and frankie machine
<START> a fun romp a lot of good twists and turns and we were not even baked br br didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd oddly it was there along with the city of lost children and the adventures of baron br br the plot keeps you wondering throughout br br the acting was awesome hank <UNK> shows his talent again bill bob is billy bob br br definitely worth watching
<START> this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i <UNK> this movie to everybody <UNK> bart
<START> i first saw this one when it was first shown so i'm not too objective about it it really managed to scare me partly because it was so late at night but partly because of that whole feeling from a <UNK> suspense story the same thing that helped dark shadows itself and the casting was so right i hardly know <UNK> <UNK> from anything else so it might not be so right to call him well cast but to me he is <UNK> gray and as far as the other male actors the one who fit his part so well was <UNK> <UNK> who's so good at larger than life characters as sir henry and john a sort of dan curtis <UNK> player at the time because of dark shadows as one poster points out this version manages to include the <UNK> with men in a fairly subtle way the scene where <UNK> <UNK> a list of men's names to john character as a way of <UNK> him and the look on face were very well done if that scene were done now it would probably be done in a too obvious way and be bad by comparison i saw it when <UNK> gray was barely a name to me let alone more so even more than the famous 1945 version which is rightly famous this is the version to me
<START> blade is a dark gloomy but vampire movie and is one of the best ones a bit of gore but nothing really that bad wesley snipes played a strong role as he <UNK> the vampires not really like buffy because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark <UNK> night thats at best viewing br br <UNK>
<START> i got to know back in the early 90s via television and i loved it br br what did you like about it the <UNK> drawing style the flawless artistic action involved the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters the whole <UNK> of the surrounding future world no matter what you loved about it br br the <UNK> <UNK> film of late 2005 has nothing of that br br <UNK> <UNK> the so called director of the film was hopelessly over strained with <UNK> the original content to a new film if you <UNK> not familiar with the original series you won't understand anything during for the first of the film the story is <UNK> and the vapid characters do not develop during the film br br attempt to improve the storyline by <UNK> some rather weak <UNK> conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a <UNK> it's simply <UNK> of the original concept br br <UNK> <UNK> might be an attractive woman but she can't <UNK> the character although she was attached to strings doing action scenes her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film the result is a tremendous amount of <UNK> picture cuts to cover up the sheer <UNK> of her <UNK> br br forget about all the rest it's not worth talking about br br i give for ms <UNK> showing her boobs and for the nice <UNK> photography in the film that's it
<START> is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this there's a bunch of apes wandering about <UNK> b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period i can't believe there's even a sequel to this br br 1
<START> this interesting lost film written by <UNK> <UNK> stars <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> forrest as two wacky southern brothers on a quest to open a <UNK> restaurant <UNK> <UNK> was never <UNK> and forrest should have been nominated originally titled the <UNK> brothers this light hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy br br where is this film i've been searching for it for 30 years <UNK> was still great back then and i'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following maybe it does these guys are a crack up with more ambition than brains but totally lovable <UNK> a 7 out of 10 if you can dig it up somewhere you'll have fun
<START> laura <UNK> creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life of course oh what jolly <UNK> don't ensue in a <UNK> flop so day <UNK> bright yet so dismal it manages to make the <UNK> 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent the sex obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher a former <UNK> <UNK> who's obviously never watched an episode of <UNK> the <UNK> in his life shame because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were <UNK> members of the human race this <UNK> <UNK> lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who <UNK> they're amusing suddenly the thought of new wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive
<START> i loved this movie but then again i am a big <UNK> fan if you have not seen a david <UNK> film then this is not a good place to start <UNK> the fly <UNK> would be a place to start and then work up to <UNK> before checking this one out this is certainly one of his best and takes the <UNK> game <UNK> one step beyond br br in this game the players plug a bio <UNK> game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal <UNK> and get into the game directly through their nervous system it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget it is full of <UNK> slimy body works dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including jennifer jason leigh jude law and willem dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously these people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it like other movies of his there is no <UNK> of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto accident you don't look away if you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one
<START> much better than expected good family flick catch it on reruns the whole is more than the sum of its parts paul <UNK> <UNK> up the scenery he has way more talent then the role deserves a treat to watch inspector from the <UNK> go over the top the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in <UNK> the cameos were particular fun for the parents nice to see lee <UNK> and <UNK> again it's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film but let's hear it for a movie that <UNK> honesty between a child and their parents amanda <UNK> does a fine job when she gets to be part of the <UNK> i normally can't stand frankie but he is just fine here hats off to the casting director if only for hiring <UNK>
<START> not for the first time i'm out of <UNK> with the majority view oz is a dreadful pretentious <UNK> series the makers have their cake and eat it oz em city etc are used as ultra crude <UNK> that the apparent <UNK> is complete fantasy this allows viewers the of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense <UNK> with everything that is bad about human beings br br when you watch an episode please remember that while the foul mouthed violent <UNK> convoluted unconvincing sick imaginary drama unfolds before your <UNK> eyes several hundred <UNK> in <UNK> parts of the world have died from bad food or water br br oz is exploitative drama at its worst it appeals to the <UNK> instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful it blows hot and cold and changes from to more often than a <UNK> br br dialogue is <UNK> ugly and <UNK> the liberties taken with realities are stupid here's a nightclub <UNK> dandy arriving at oz in his <UNK> <UNK> complete with a ridiculously <UNK> contact lens in one eye <UNK> a <UNK> of drugs that nobody <UNK> here's a murderous <UNK> <UNK> about the heat death of the universe begging to be killed but of course being refused by the <UNK> he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself br br the action races on at a pace fast enough for the <UNK> dim witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown don't worry a betrayal a murder a sex scene will be along within a minute or two br br finally oz is obviously pretentious you don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers writers and actors are doing everything with a huge <UNK> or same word but for a change of <UNK> to the audience br br yes you can be a nasty minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the <UNK> post <UNK> etc skills of the oz production team they appeal to the lowest common <UNK> while pretending to operate on a higher plane br br truly a despicable series and every hour it shows rewarding its makers and actors and <UNK> advertising <UNK> for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible successful widely praised series
<START> sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good this movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english so you have to get past that the acting also was stilted and forced other than what was done by the real rats who imo did an excellent job of acting the part <UNK> to the rat <UNK> anyway the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage <UNK> go on strike as a result thus leaving large <UNK> of trash everywhere this storyline has been used before not to mention has happened in real life too often unfortunately and the audience is not in for any surprises but this is fine we know what's going to happen and when and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along we have our hero down to the <UNK> face and body the semi hero s and of course our heroine who happens to be the doctor but only still in training though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying and not just from a rat bite of course the villain must die okay all the villains meaning the rats and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not
<START> <UNK> is one of those awful <UNK> which manages to get into <UNK> and give <UNK> a bad name telling a <UNK> <UNK> tale of <UNK> twin sisters who crawl from a <UNK> car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily <UNK> making goo goo eyes at some guy and ending up on an army post so <UNK> no army would want it yeah right an apparent attempt at a coming of age flick <UNK> is an almost complete loser which wanders <UNK> as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with <UNK> a shred of credibility to be found anywhere not recommended for anyone
<START> this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb <UNK> <UNK> once again doing a poor stallone imitation is ray <UNK> a ex con just out on <UNK> all he wants is his old girlfriend <UNK> played by a young <UNK> gay <UNK> back unfortunately for ray <UNK> has hooked up with <UNK> elliot played by sam <UNK> further <UNK> matters is that <UNK> old cell buddies want some <UNK> and they kidnap <UNK> to make sure they happen ray and elliot team up despite mutual dislike br br what follows is violent and slow but <UNK> gay <UNK> shows us why she would win oscar in the future she's not as polished here but her raw emotion sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching almost br br rent fever no the title doesn't fit the film if your a fan of hers otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things br br note this is a hard r flick for language violence and nudity
<START> paul <UNK> interesting odd and strange movie about a mid life crisis set in nyc and a remote greek island with john <UNK> as world renowned architect who decides to drop out he is accompanied by his daughter molly <UNK> and a <UNK> singer susan sarandon a beautiful transfer of this 25 year old movie on the dvd but without any extras not even the theatrical trailer tons of great scenery and razor sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip <UNK> julia and gena rowlands round out a strong cast a good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity this recent dvd release is worth renting b
<START> i saw this at the san francisco independent film festival and liked it a lot it worked for me as a slightly weird comedy because i don't like horror but there were only a couple of minutes i had to close my eyes br br the dialog was good the costumes and settings were not far off bbc quality which is amazing for an indie film i liked the way the plot twists and even <UNK> it kept surprising me in good ways i even <UNK> up to the willy character who i quite disliked at the beginning it would have been better if <UNK> been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island that felt very much like a plot device br br i am fond of dominic <UNK> and he did a good job at <UNK> horror and at the more thoughtful moments nice voice in the narration too br br this would be a fun and unusual date movie
<START> this was the best movie ever has seen on <UNK> club <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century it cause a very good impression to all the partners of <UNK> club i recommend this movie to all the fans of troma and to all the people who like the good movies not the commercial movies
<START> this is another of my favorite <UNK> it sports a top notch cast including john cassavetes who was never or <UNK> <UNK> myrna loy and <UNK> <UNK> now here's something i've always wondered had paltrow been born when this episode was shot or was <UNK> pregnant at the time thanks to imdb i have my answer she was five pregnant now i can really feel ancient br br cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to <UNK> was apparently to use the social connections of her mother loy he has a mistress on the side <UNK> a prominent <UNK> but she <UNK> she wants more she's sick of being back street on the night of their concert he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide columbo picks up a few problems immediately one thing he notices you have a beautiful woman here bedroom eyes she has money a body and a career where's the man it's wonderful to see falk and good friend cassavetes together there's a very funny episode at the vet with <UNK> <UNK> everyone in the cast is great br br this is one of the episodes that made columbo the classic series it became
<START> i haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater and i have been searching for it since at the time i was 12 and the story excited me and now the ending <UNK> me it was young love that <UNK> me the most not to mention john's <UNK> and lyrics the story at the time hit home to my psyche i am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years it is that good place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run if this movie didn't <UNK> your curiosity then you were just too old i look forward to seeing it again even at my age if nostalgia is in your <UNK> i'm sure this is an interesting movie to see it's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable
<START> i'm not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this poor excuse for a film but whatever they thought of didn't help this movie it only hurt it and it hurt this film badly the acting for once isn't the problem it's the horrible editing scenes will end for no apparent reason while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid sentence i'm not sure what the story was but it didn't really matter since what i did see was fairly uninteresting just bad all around a huge jaws rip off and not a good one at that the <UNK> version was funny though 7 for that none for the film itself
<START> overall this is entertaining and odd film don't try to make sense of it there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with but robert <UNK> and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this fugitive like story br br unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie this fugitive isn't looking for a one armed man but a two armed nazi <UNK> by the the name of frank <UNK> <UNK> barry kane gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the <UNK> looking for the man who did it <UNK> to clear his name br br the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting then <UNK> lane pat martin enters the story and it starts to <UNK> down a bit with some sappy dialog director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked <UNK> character here was a little lame br br actually the villains played by otto <UNK> charles <UNK> and norman lloyd frank <UNK> were the best in my opinion just fascinating acting and dialog was especially good br br if you haven't seen this film but saw hitchcock's well known north by <UNK> you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it instead of a climactic scene at <UNK> <UNK> here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty as usual hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view
<START> certainly when i saw this movie at hbo i was bit <UNK> in following the plot but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies but then in the long run it changes my point of view seeing this stirring film made me experience once again at my seat not <UNK> my tears suddenly roll down my cheek and then after let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i myself couldn't imagine how it touched me the story was strongly emotional but is not <UNK> with such the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film like the role of meryl streep she was a mother who honestly <UNK> her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle dustin hoffman was way too outstanding i can't even <UNK> how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different then performed it well even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times when i seat back and <UNK> at my home <UNK> worth movies to <UNK> and buy a time for it catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment
<START> although i have definitely read this particular agatha christie book at some point i didn't remember anything about it except the name which is a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer genius of agatha christie the way she <UNK> you and then pulls the <UNK> out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and <UNK> in addition to her stories the excellent production values beautiful locations wonderful music top notch acting elegant directing etc are the reasons for this <UNK> success and <UNK> and all those virtues are present in after the funeral a word of advice be alert right from the start there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence there are some quite unnerving moments as well in contrast to the peaceful looking english countryside locations and some small touches of humor a must see for mystery buffs and just a very good film in general
<START> the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction the first really bad thing is the guy <UNK> steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by <UNK> driving but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie br br it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will <UNK> your chance of getting a headache br br i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies
<START> with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the <UNK> together <UNK> of the first and yet to my horror <UNK> is far worse than i could have imagined br br my hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the predator ship and i almost <UNK> a sigh of relief when we finally saw the predator home world a throwaway digital <UNK> painting but still nice to finally see it and then of course the humans if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such are introduced br br one must wonder why it seems to be impossible for fox to make a good film out of aliens and <UNK> at the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their <UNK> br br characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst friday the 13th sequel the pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it <UNK> and teen non actors do not make for a real film they make for a cheap flick and alien 1 3 and the predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept remember that the 1st alien is a b movie done as an a movie the brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been <UNK> by simply knowing their alien predator roots in both the alien and predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group alien <UNK> workers aliens marines alien 3 <UNK> and in the predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit predator arnold special forces predator 2 danny glover police and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both <UNK> started to go wrong in alien we have pirates or something we have <UNK> with guns and of course in r we have teen slasher clichés what is there to identify with here in concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a first blood type of action hero but like many things it was never paid off br br the film making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason there is no sense of forward momentum to the action just small sequences that build the most <UNK> levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting taking the audience out of the movie at every turn the action scenes themselves though much <UNK> in the trailers are so darkly lit it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur basically the movie is <UNK> from many levels bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay which as a screenwriter myself i noticed seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most <UNK> writer devoid of ideas could have <UNK> together the writing if it can be called that is not even direct to video quality nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established <UNK> of the previous entries in the series why does the all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien <UNK> down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an <UNK> for more than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight and given the <UNK> growth time even more so than the first as quickly as possible why must meaningless small talk between cardboard <UNK> on sticks meaning the supposed characters substitute for real character development remember a character is defined by what they do not say why is the sheriff leading civilians to a <UNK> of guns isn't he an officer of the law how does the bimbo of all people know where they are why does the wait for the predator to very slowly remove his mask before it attacks why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series post alien 3 habit of <UNK> all the time to let their prey know to run how on earth did this series <UNK> to a character saying people are dying we need guns how this writer even works is beyond me and reflects badly on <UNK> already destroyed artistic reputation it's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental <UNK> or really are that inept at every level of the film making process br br the effects are pretty lousy this time around the aliens look like men in suits and <UNK> is just getting lazy with their creature design the aliens look like <UNK> <UNK> from alien <UNK> with that same <UNK> <UNK> around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design nor a good one to <UNK> again everything is <UNK> in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere but simply to hide how bad the creatures look and just like in stan winston is sorely missed when the fake looking predator face is revealed br br there are too many faults to list so i will just say this do not waste your money on this movie fox is beyond caring about the fans as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of i felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it though it was free and <UNK> to her <UNK> after this is one die hard fan who is done with the franchise br br note to fox what we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick it was a film adaptation of the original which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993 br br <UNK> off
<START> spoiler alert this was my son's review of the movie which he wanted me to post he wrote this i swear br br with malcolm in the frankie and amanda <UNK> they get to go to show business they team up on the actor paul <UNK> he stole jason <UNK> <UNK> on big fat liar and makes it in to a movie jason frankie and amanda <UNK> have to go to l a to get it back <UNK> dad does not believe that he wrote that <UNK> so every time they see each other jason asks wolf paul <UNK> to give <UNK> dad a call because he wants his <UNK> back wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it at the end the family and see the movie made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd
<START> why oh why is this trash considered a classic i've seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it's running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low rent soap opera br br the <UNK> family are going through tough times and when dad is away <UNK> and little boy go to get the car fixed but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the <UNK> st bernard circles them over and over br br regarding the kid i have never ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life and obviously he's completely <UNK> since blonde haired and blue eyed kids such as the one <UNK> featured on of <UNK> chocolate are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me all he does is cry and <UNK> same goes for <UNK> she gets out the car she gets in the car she gets out the car she gets in the car br br i know this was made in 1983 but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid illogical decisions if <UNK> just used some common sense she'd be able to get away from the <UNK> dog br br it's very poorly written and there's zero tension if you want to see a good bad dog movie then check out john man's best friend it's funny inventive has a better dog a higher body count and a more involving story leave this garbage be
<START> it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different br br we get the usual ripped off scenes from i want you <UNK> the <UNK> gives the richard gere character his <UNK> of <UNK> in hopes he'll quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the <UNK> is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top <UNK> plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here <UNK> is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves br br the main problem with this wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one dimensional you never care for either in the least and when character finally turns around just like gere did in you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point <UNK> and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he <UNK> story or the other six plot points in the movie what's more <UNK> is the great reviews i see here the general <UNK> opinions never <UNK> to <UNK> me
<START> whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film making it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever br br if you're depressed already this film will send you over the edge br br if you're feeling somewhat depressed this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time br br otherwise you might be able to make it through this film <UNK> i didn't btw safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than <UNK> then again you might consider that you have been <UNK> yourself and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish br br the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie i hated it it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly for no reason whatsoever looked back at itself and then stopped br br jim does not have an <UNK> at least not one that is conveyed on screen jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of <UNK> he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self discovery br br of course no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie as others have said it's no hollywood tale it's gritty and it's real it's well made life is quite a struggle at times if anyone were to know the answer they do well to shout it from the <UNK> br br still i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say you feel that it's going to say something that if you just suffer through a little more of it it'll have something to say it'll make you stop and think br br it doesn't br br again i do submit that this is a well crafted film and therefore may be of value to a film student with a <UNK> for e g lighting techniques of the use of colour <UNK> br br for the rest of us it's utterly miss able
<START> as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that <UNK> the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director <UNK> <UNK> decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies br br a tale of two sisters <UNK> the story as it's name suggest of two sisters <UNK> <UNK> and the younger <UNK> <UNK> who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their <UNK> gradually rising <UNK> and <UNK> behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so i'll just leave it at that br br the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out <UNK> <UNK> focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective <UNK> <UNK> the weaker <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> father to the <UNK> frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it br br the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat <UNK> <UNK> direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the film's <UNK> scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film br br a tale of two sisters is a <UNK> how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better
<START> the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available this show has gone from informative news to <UNK> <UNK> i tried to support this show in its decline because i like human interest stories and <UNK> used to have some very good ones unfortunately april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the <UNK> <UNK> that participate in it abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the <UNK> of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the <UNK> instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals they had some pop <UNK> send stern <UNK> to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too <UNK> i was truly <UNK> i hope this review stops one person from watching this <UNK> trash in the future if it does i will be happy these days all you can expect from diane <UNK> and the good folks from <UNK> live are butt kissing sessions with a list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars don't waste the hour of your life you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at <UNK>
<START> claire booth the women shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play and 1939 film that also has joan crawford playing a bitch a character who might have been amanda <UNK> 20 years before that has no male characters here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are they use women like toys and throw them away leaving the women to suffer ironically the women in the women perhaps because they are all we see are shown in a less than <UNK> light alternately silly and scheming with the only nice one norma <UNK> growing <UNK> by the end in the best of everything we see the men for the <UNK> they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable br br this is a film about women <UNK> from things diane baker leaps from a car in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history which is not in the book <UNK> parker falls from a fire escape the women in the film are <UNK> into the <UNK> looking for success and love at the same time women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade but they would come back to it in the 80's and 90's through the novels of people like sidney <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> although their works aren't as good as this br br the best thing about this film is the way it looks i love the glossy <UNK> films of the 50's and 60's they look so much better than the challenged home movies we've been making since especially in the <UNK> version we see on tv and the dvd with the picture so clear you could walk into it the look of the <UNK> of young <UNK> in it is also memorable this film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other it has a <UNK> <UNK> parker a beauty queen myrna <UNK> who was not miss america 1954 as <UNK> <UNK> says in the dvd commentary but rather miss usa 1953 per the imdb but so what and a playboy <UNK> june blair from january 1957 my vote goes to <UNK> one of the astonishing <UNK> of all time her acting here isn't as awful as people pretend they are just <UNK> as people did then to the sight of a <UNK> the first really trying to act nobody seemed to care how well she did her role that of an apparently <UNK> woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine br br the most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time hope lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959 diane baker was 20 <UNK> parker was 26 hope who looked to be grace kelly's heir never made it really big and wound up being mrs <UNK> on television and per the imdb wound up living in a home with <UNK> for coffee tables because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age <UNK> in 2003 this film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then baker always a welcome face in 60's tv especially to richard <UNK> and still active as an actress and acting coach just turned <UNK> parker found the best of everything with <UNK> <UNK> for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year lange did but here they are young beautiful and ambitious for success and love just like their characters
<START> oh my god the <UNK> hit a new low with this <UNK> act of political correctness a mixed race family living in <UNK> with a disabled kid thrown in for good measure whoever <UNK> this tripe should be hunted down and thrown to the dogs the usually funny <UNK> <UNK> is about as funny as <UNK> in this show and don't get me started about the others they have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb i only hope comedy will get better but with the likes of little britain and catherine <UNK> about i severely doubt this i think you'd be better off getting the box set for a decent comedy from <UNK> such as <UNK> towers or bottom if you want a laugh br br <UNK> this <UNK> clean rubbish
<START> there is no doubt that alfred hitchcock was a seriously talented director many of his films are <UNK> classics that have stood the test of time and are highly watchable to this day this list could include the <UNK> steps rear window north by <UNK> <UNK> m for murder vertigo the birds shadow of a doubt and a few other films br br however suspicion is not aging well at all and is really so unwatchable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even by 1941 standards the list of scenes that work well could be listed on a with a <UNK> the script is loose and ridiculous most of the time but the acting seems so forced and wooden and borderline amateurish throughout that it is almost unbelievable joan fontaine tries to shore things up but she is on a <UNK> <UNK> and cary grant doesn't provide much assistance his acting is so bad at times that i have seen better performances in high school plays or college theatre experience classes where a chemical engineer is acting for the first time with no <UNK> training br br after about 30 minutes of watching this film you may find yourself reaching for the dvd <UNK> in the dark to see if you accidentally picked up some kind of special edition version that was <UNK> together without any editing br br the subject matter is serious yet the film has a silly and trite feel to it that just seems so out of place you become <UNK> with <UNK> br br suspicion is basically unwatchable and another very very very overrated bad movie
<START> the brief existence of the sex <UNK> and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking english punk <UNK> break up both happened before i was born however i started listening to their only album never mind the b s here's the sex <UNK> in 2003 when i was a teenager and quickly became a big fan i didn't see the great rock <UNK> roll <UNK> until 2006 but saw it a couple times that year and thought it was pretty good certainly not great but pretty good even if i could only remember bits of it and didn't see how it all connected seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second i didn't care much for it at all i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place can't remember now br br this film is a <UNK> in which sex <UNK> manager malcolm <UNK> tells his side of the story of the band and its members <UNK> steve jones credited here as the crook drummer paul cook credited as the tea maker <UNK> sid vicious credited as the gimmick and john <UNK> a k a johnny rotten credited as the <UNK> <UNK> claims that he created the band and even the genre of punk rock as a <UNK> to make money he tells much of the story to helen <UNK> lloyd a k a helen of <UNK> in various places where they go together it's basically a <UNK> of <UNK> talking <UNK> songs live footage of the band fictional scenes often silly strange ones several cartoon sequences etc all put together in one film to tell the <UNK> <UNK> side of the story in a bizarre way br br it has been well proved that <UNK> is a liar i know many have already pointed this out including band members themselves he was not the driving force of the band he didn't create them nor did he <UNK> punk rock and the sex <UNK> weren't even the first punk band though they were unique the band members were the ones who made the band what it was the filth and the fury a much more believable film about the band from <UNK> temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who <UNK> <UNK> claims however the <UNK> of the great rock <UNK> roll <UNK> is not my biggest problem with it if it were actually entertaining which i used to think it was to a certain extent i would be able to overlook that like i obviously used to be able to do during my third viewing apart from sex <UNK> songs some live footage and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence it was pretty dull i found the who killed <UNK> song mildly amusing at first but it got <UNK> very quickly br br is this <UNK> worth watching for sex <UNK> fans it seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the short lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band but for entertainment that was once my opinion on the great rock <UNK> roll <UNK> after the first time i watched it i couldn't remember a thing <UNK> said and by the time i saw it the second time i was aware of what the <UNK> manager was using this film to imply but could still barely remember anything i heard him say obviously other aspects of the film were what i found impressive now after my third viewing i can definitely remember some of the things <UNK> says but it still wasn't 100 clear like most of the film i guess his words are not that memorable probably because of the way they're presented if you're a <UNK> fan i guess it wouldn't hurt to give <UNK> a try but to me for the most part it's just an incoherent boring mess that tries to be funny but fails
<START> a <UNK> in cinematic history is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic it was the picture that made <UNK> m <UNK> a <UNK> of film making at the time and today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been br br is a film that needs to be seen as one <UNK> not to be picked at don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the sequence and then move on to <UNK> <UNK> or 'the <UNK> see it all in it's glorious 75 minute running time to really understand and enjoy it don't expect every <UNK> detail to be perfect though i mean the acting of the <UNK> silent era makes <UNK> <UNK> look like a master of understated realism certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie br br the most memorable moments in the film are the <UNK> on the <UNK> body falling off the ship the sailor under the <UNK> at the end of the <UNK> the mother holding her dead child the baby <UNK> on the <UNK> steps and the lion rising up to <UNK> as further carnage ensues for each new pair of eyes that look upon it 'the <UNK> comes alive once again
<START> this film gets off to a bad start an incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly done truly amazing spaceship crash then things go downhill again as you realize that the survivors are all a bad actors apart from the <UNK> pilot and the psychopath and b almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster fodder hell half of them don't even speak english <UNK> the audience from getting to know the characters at all you feel as if you were watching deep blue sea meets silence of the <UNK> minus the good bits and unfortunately the entire thing tries to hard to be crashed on a desert planet with <UNK> <UNK> during the daylight scenes <UNK> <UNK> is a great actor but he is no anthony hopkins and he frankly <UNK> as the smart hyper cool psycho there is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so br br but then things take a turn i can't exactly <UNK> the moment but soon the movie gets a lot better it also feels less chopped the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative and <UNK> <UNK> becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show <UNK> by the time the first monsters appear the film is actually quite enjoyable by the time night falls it is great thrilling horrifying and exciting and even the character development of most main characters is well done if you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some great entertainment br br besides the visuals are eye candy and i honestly admit i love the colour and the tone of this movie br br 7 10 could have been 9 10 if only
<START> every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be br br the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be br br a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b <UNK> and lots of blood br br if you want to <UNK> the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports <UNK> digital or <UNK> 5 without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and don't forget to switch the light off br br my points on different aspects br br direction 9 10 acting 8 10 atmosphere 10 10 sound effect 9 10 br br total 9 10
<START> i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it pretty well if you ask me it was a pretty good show anytime i think about it i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well in addition to that everyone was <UNK> cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> thanks to silly horror movies like <UNK> and the <UNK> atrocious cult favorite <UNK> 2 it has become practically impossible to take movies with <UNK> and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days only just recently i watched the 70's made for tv movie don't be afraid of the dark which is basically a quite terrifying and serious toned film about domestic little <UNK> monsters and yet i still couldn't help thinking back about the laugh inducing <UNK> headed <UNK> dressed in garbage <UNK> that were running amok in <UNK> 2 same thing happened to me now as much as i tried going into inhabited with a clear mindset <UNK> i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden <UNK> with the badly <UNK> <UNK> of still even without all the prejudices inhabited is a remotely entertaining albeit <UNK> straight to video horror flick it's a cheesy soft and politically correct <UNK> of family drama and northern europe mythology the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average <UNK> they are the wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through <UNK> the youngest children this <UNK> the russell family as they move into their <UNK> dream house in a remote little town the <UNK> blond daughter of <UNK> actress <UNK> <UNK> starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden she claims her friends are <UNK> and even though the sinister <UNK> also warns for strange <UNK> in the past <UNK> parents simply think the girl has troubles <UNK> to her new neighborhood when she keeps <UNK> about <UNK> they <UNK> an <UNK> with the acclaimed psychologist dr <UNK> whilst the are slowly coming out of their shelter not much special to mention here the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute you understand this is a family friendly horror movie so no bloody murder sequences are <UNK> being shown here heck even the <UNK> of the family's pet cat is kept off screen this is the <UNK> nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an <UNK> greedy and self centered authority figure
<START> amanda <UNK> is an enormously talented actress and i've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past especially in the fantastic she's the man for that reason alone sydney white was a huge disappointment for me the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters in a good fun teen comedy its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality based teen characters in sydney white this idea is thrown out the window br br amanda <UNK> makes a fine sydney but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her <UNK> as an actress i blame this on the script which makes her character too bland and restrained and on the hair makeup department which gives her a <UNK> plastic look and an annoying hair style the seven <UNK> that sydney eventually befriends are far worse they are so <UNK> that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters they're essentially repulsive gag fodder as is the story's prince charming who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be br br perhaps the film's biggest star to be with the possible exception of amanda <UNK> is sara paxton who's actually very good as the conniving rachel it's just a shame that the script writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black br br the plot is basically that of snow white what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re imagining the connections to snow white are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown prince charming is <UNK> charming the witch is far too <UNK> <UNK> the seven <UNK> are too <UNK> and sydney is just too pure of heart now this is not to say that the movie is all bad though <UNK> is forced down by the script she still has her moments as does sara paxton who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes room mate named <UNK> is also great fun as a character it's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichéd to recommend
<START> this is a semi fictional <UNK> of an international man who have witnessed various political <UNK> in recent 30 years br br i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting however i was disappointed by this film <UNK> seemed <UNK> with the main character <UNK> staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes as could be expected no detailed storyline could be <UNK> in such time frame the excuses of him moving to another place were often <UNK> explained the result was a disappointing collection of <UNK> clips shot in various countries
<START> what a terrible misfire not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda george segal vehicle of a few decades ago why i wonder someone with the <UNK> of jim carrey will not only star but also produce this tired ugly pointless excuse for a comedy he could be taking comedy to a whole new level instead he goes for what he may assume is safe territory money money christmas but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny and failing miserably it could have been an outrageous politically incorrect mirror comedy of the post <UNK> days but no that would be pointing too high too <UNK> what a shame
<START> i think trash really sucks i watched it a couple of weeks ago and i haven't seen that kind of c p at the cinema since female trouble by john waters and that was even worse the dialogues the acting it really <UNK> it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back but actually i am glad i saw it because then i could tell my honest opinion on it one should see this film even though it stinks
<START> <UNK> starts months on the submarine the ss <UNK> where genetic experiments have gone awry the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer <UNK> jump to <UNK> a couple of months later where general <UNK> james lieutenant williams john miranda on his mission to board the <UNK> assist genetic scientist dr <UNK> ryan michelle meadows before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists marines are on board the <UNK> are shocked to discover he <UNK> corpses of the crew apart from dr mike thompson <UNK> clark who doesn't make much sense it's not long before the <UNK> attack first to fall is lt williams so sergeant sam <UNK> christopher <UNK> is promoted takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety end the menace of the giant <UNK> forever br br this <UNK> america co production was directed by martin he also handled the cinematography i thought this was a strictly by the numbers uninspiring creature feature it's early into the new year <UNK> is the first giant <UNK> mutated monster creature <UNK> type film i've seen in 2007 hopefully things can only get better the script by <UNK> is incredibly clichéd gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably aliens 1986 lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine there's the <UNK> assembled team of marines including one who <UNK> on a <UNK> throughout the entire film there's the scientists including a blonde <UNK> one to try explain it all the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life the final <UNK> being the monster alien <UNK> or whatever in this case there's loads of large <UNK> running around but they're not <UNK> in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer <UNK> yeah it's all here unfortunately <UNK> isn't an aliens if you get what i mean it's a touch long at over 100 minutes it's <UNK> predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb br br director doesn't <UNK> himself it's not scary there's a lack of atmosphere the action scenes are dull <UNK> there's not many <UNK> attacks it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that's for sure i mean that's not to say the effects in <UNK> are good but i've seen worse there isn't much blood or gore there's some <UNK> bodies some decapitated heads someone is ripped in half the only clever amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked <UNK> female scientist <UNK> her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the <UNK> however there was a moment which had me <UNK> <UNK> my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to <UNK> the <UNK> get the lights working by hitting the power supply computer boards with a hammer it works as well br br technically <UNK> is average at best there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous <UNK> was shot in <UNK> in if your interested the acting was poor there's nothing else to say br br <UNK> isn't a great film it isn't a great horror film either i can't recommend it at all but i've seen worse if you liked <UNK> unlikely you might like the similarly themed <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> films tail <UNK> 2001 or 2006 just as unlikely
<START> stumbled over this film on amazon com had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copy br br have to say that i was not impressed the production values are cheap the story is derivative the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs br br i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypes br br there are bits in the film that make no sense at all like one of the leather <UNK> trying to get in a <UNK> like he'd even look at him twice or the vengeful ex wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband <UNK> is not the word well at least it explains the movies uk title i suppose
<START> spoiler terrible camera work horrible writing non existent plot and numerous plot <UNK> wonderful acting except for julia roberts who poorly plays someone who is <UNK> julia roberts poorly catherine zeta jones is adorable in this movie br br during the movie we repeatedly zoom in on each of the twelve characters twelve is too many even for a classic like 12 angry men and the problem is we <UNK> zoom in on the characters when all of them are in the same room doing the same thing br br yep <UNK> eating yep <UNK> eating yep the jew is eating yep the geek is eating yep the eating yep mr sensitive is eating yep yep yep yep yep yep <UNK> this happens at least three other times in the movie yep they're all sitting in cars bored yep they're all getting arrested frightened yep they're all being led out of a jail depressed br br but it wasn't until i was home that i realized how badly they'd got me on this one this is a heist movie right that's what i went to see right but when i walked in and set my car keys in the change jar only then i realized nothing was actually stolen in this movie that's right it's a heist movie where nothing gets stolen oh they try they go to try and steal some boring document or something from some guy's house whatever and it turns out it's already been stolen 20 minutes of my life wasted then they try to steal some egg from some museum yawn and they screw that up and get arrested br br then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did and we get all the joy of <UNK> except this time the person inside the tight dancing around the fake <UNK> is an ugly skinny french guy um br br but it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either actually our heroes stole the egg <UNK> ago in another movie entirely which would have been a great movie to watch had they made that movie br br instead we see a 30 second clip in black and white about how they robbed some college student of his back pack you heard me the daring caper the ultimate heist the <UNK> of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap is them stealing a back pack from a college student by <UNK> getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him and replacing his back pack with an identical back pack what br br ugh i'm telling you this was so bad i didn't even realize just how bad it was just how badly i'd been robbed until i got home
<START> i am speechless honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have <UNK> to a script like this cast anyone in the film let alone direct it the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers this film should be thrown in to the <UNK> rather than be reviewed i am disappointed in <UNK> alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone <UNK> the role <UNK> i think i just insulted the word <UNK> uh yeah i did <UNK> what the less said about this mindless drivel the better you have been warned nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself watch at your own risk
<START> this movie was awesome it's a documentary about how surfing influenced <UNK> in the early days it has interviews with <UNK> such as tony <UNK> my idol and <UNK> <UNK> to name a couple <UNK> is a so called ghetto part of california where there used to be an amusement park that was torn down people started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park soon the surf team was formed that led to first real start in <UNK> the z boys were a team of <UNK> teenagers who loved <UNK> and started the phenomenon known as <UNK> <UNK> they started it by <UNK> in <UNK> swimming <UNK> that's just a bit of the story behind it it even contains rare footage from charlie's angels of <UNK> <UNK> making a cameo i think you should buy this movie if you are a <UNK> it'll teach you that <UNK> wasn't always popular even if you are not buy
<START> princess warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters one evil and one good fight for control of the throne the good sister is being beaten so she escapes to earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t shirt contest the rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister but the younger sister is helped by bob a good hearted dj and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister's ignorance of earth customs and culture the older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again throughout all of this action there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age <UNK> to bring the good sister back sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around los angeles and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed the film <UNK> in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending br br it seems to borrow elements from star wars the light <UNK> and the look of the girls' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes dr who the phone booth like means of <UNK> and some of the costumes from the cult on the home planet could have been taken from star trek episodes br br ms dana the evil sister in the movie in another user comment mentioned the endless and dull wet t shirt contest it is seriously the longest wet t shirt contest in cinema history and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength <UNK> <UNK> shirts that <UNK> all efforts to get them wet and <UNK> i couldn't state it any better the only thing i would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying br br most of the acting is pretty over the top but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie the actors playing <UNK> and <UNK> were just too much for me i just found them annoying ms seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously in contrast to sharon lee jones who acted <UNK> but seemed to be taking everything more seriously all of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots presumably to add comic relief which is a bit unnecessary given that the whole movie was rather comical br br from a ratings perspective this film had a lot of foul language some topless women and others scantily clad in <UNK> but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity one sex scene that was portrayed in a non graphic arty <UNK> fashion and little violence while there were <UNK> of violence throughout the scenes of both sword fighting and <UNK> were exaggerated and too camp to be offensive though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it br br i have to wonder who came up with the character names a small egg a <UNK> <UNK> used for <UNK> and cleaning <UNK> similar to a disease <UNK> by <UNK> skin and an eating disorder with and and another disease br br overall this is a bad low budget campy sci fi action movie but it did keep me entertained though i might need a few drinks before watching it again
<START> i bought the video for at <UNK> we pay more in britain as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive br br i have to say that the opening credits were a let down the dancing music not very powerful br br the car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be <UNK> was a nice touch something unexpected though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly <UNK> and still carrying a <UNK> looked corny for most directors but for lynch was something else br br her <UNK> walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers <UNK> along a <UNK> i thought another lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons <UNK> into her shocked and <UNK> self conscious after a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation i discovered the new video <UNK> <UNK> br br i dont know whether this <UNK> took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time and money br br the two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough though predictable there were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes the hoover switching on there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous <UNK> the coffee being <UNK> into the <UNK> by the menacing <UNK> and the silly monster face at the back of the diner oh and what about the paint in the <UNK> boring and <UNK> br br this whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius you know when you listen to the worst dylan track ever and think my god that was embarrassing was that really bob br br the whole feel is that of a failed tv movie badly put together with a few not many extra bits to give it a 15 rating br br i it on during the last 30 minutes br br do i give it another chance and watch again if i want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film i will watch frank woods guide to <UNK> <UNK> br br lynch did one classic blue <UNK> and straight story was nice br br this like wild at heart was a let down his weirdness is now predictable and stale anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video br br make way for some younger original talent david br br four out of ten and no more sorry
<START> i just finished watching the movie tonight and i truly loved it john denver didn't play a <UNK> but it was the <UNK> of the little town who decided to leave the floor for john denver to speak it's a really great movie with a wonderful christmas message it was also fun to watch
<START> wow what can i say i was born in 1960 i love bad tv movies love them i get involved the works i want to get involved i'm spending time watching the thing i watched the <UNK> last night on tv how in the <UNK> world was the empire falls excellent name tv movie up for any awards it truly had wonderful talent of course and they tried admirably but how can anyone pretend that was an ok tv for goodness <UNK> screenplay ok direction you know i wish everyone the best really but i thought it was totally mind <UNK> that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many <UNK> awards for me it was sort of a wake up call that hollywood is such a small <UNK> community being cynical is not really my thing but wow
<START> in this movie everything possible was wrong and i don't know why i bothered watching it until the end it would have been more fun watching paint dry for crying out loud i even liked d and it was much better than this here is the basic plot for you a redneck gets bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes an undead killing machine murdering teenagers that have zero personality during the movie i lost hope when it didn't scare me at all when the kills were bad and there was bad cgi blood and cgi snakes it got worse with the cardboard thin characters killing their friend by holding her from her legs and not letting go so she got <UNK> by a tree and when the bad guy moved under water like the shark in jaws i'm still upset why i even bothered with this i guess because i'm a horror movie fan
<START> i being a fan of rupert rented this film a few months ago i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors it was entertaining and showed that rupert could play more than his most well known character of ron his subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable br br ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job he finds one and becomes the i guess you could call assistant to a retired actress at first it is just a way for him to earn some money but after a while he and seem to develop a friendship helps ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself and in the end they both seem to need each other br br whether you are a fan of rupert or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors
<START> i saw peter <UNK> and the war game a few months before this and was very impressed the technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film <UNK> on the one hand a trial of in california in the apparently near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to <UNK> through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a government run punishment park as an alternative to prison films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little <UNK> or required strong suspension of disbelief how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and <UNK> prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery and that's merely the most obvious example but questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch no question you have to be interested in political film making to really get involved but the film really isn't like anything else of its era it pulls no punches offers no simple <UNK> the <UNK> political figures are certainly painted <UNK> at times but they aren't all alike the right wing government seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an <UNK> taste 8 10 dvd rental
<START> this is one of the most satisfying of the book to tv adaptations the actress who make us believe that a <UNK> could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and <UNK> can have some redeeming qualities br br the tv plot line does not follow <UNK> story exactly but is both exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a darn good yarn if you have a <UNK> for romance in uniform there is a lot of sexual energy <UNK> between our man <UNK> and the lying <UNK> made me wish her role was closer to that in the books but no matter there is enough hero <UNK> hero redeemed hero in rage hero in flight and hero in battle to keep you <UNK> to your dvd play
<START> i agree with another reviewer this is such a shattering film that will be tough to watch again soon though for quality alone it deserves repeated viewing the complexity of the characters the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching br br there is one scene of the two <UNK> dragging themselves through the snow to escape a <UNK> that's perhaps for sheer <UNK> the most amazing performance i've ever seen in fact though not episodic the story flows this is a movie of memorable scenes there's the passing of <UNK> amongst the <UNK> the snow scenes the ruined farm scene the encounters in the houses the <UNK> the basement scene the <UNK> all stand out like <UNK> in a <UNK> br br for me the <UNK> isn't overt frankly i don't think it would have been <UNK> in a soviet film i do see this as an existential <UNK> about the value of life here is a tale where the hero and he is a true hero becomes the villain and the weaker one becomes the stronger one is this a mystical process or one <UNK> by circumstances there is a but does it come from within or without you must see the movie to understand the issues for they can't be discussed without giving away too much of the story i can't say enough about the acting it's hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting i'm not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors but they are all superb i also note how director uses children they remind me of child angels br br there is a little <UNK> in the end there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier and the <UNK> but this is left <UNK> and the final scene is a bit ambiguous but compared to the total experience these are <UNK> this is a movie that will mark you for life
<START> in alfred hitchcock's adaptation of patricia strangers on a train guy haines <UNK> granger and bruno anthony robert walker meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders the rather <UNK> anthony suggests that he could murder <UNK> <UNK> wife and haines could murder <UNK> <UNK> father the lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain <UNK> the <UNK> of the conversation leaves the more easy going haines with the impression that the <UNK> is not entirely serious complications <UNK> later when anthony murders <UNK> wife in an amusement park and then <UNK> haines to keep his side of the bargain br br the differences between the two men are clear from the start haines is a professional <UNK> player respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas <UNK> life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three <UNK> for drinking and gambling haines is in a relationship with a <UNK> daughter who he wants to marry anthony <UNK> <UNK> this as a cynical <UNK> on <UNK> part to provide himself with a <UNK> to a career the character differences are also <UNK> visually anthony often <UNK> <UNK> areas and travels in a boat called <UNK> whereas haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles br br there are some striking visual sequences such as br br 1 the murder of <UNK> wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from anthony br br 2 the depiction of anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white <UNK> <UNK> building br br 3 the occasion where all the <UNK> at a <UNK> match are moving their heads in <UNK> following the action whilst one head <UNK> <UNK> remains fixed in a position looking at haines br br 4 the scene where the <UNK> goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly br br frequent use is made of <UNK> throughout the story for example haines and anthony are originally introduced as 2 <UNK> of feet getting out of their <UNK> and going to the train as the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward the 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double the hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass haines feels double crossed when his wife on an <UNK> they had for her to see a lawyer to <UNK> a divorce <UNK> wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends when anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 <UNK> in her glasses anthony later becomes very <UNK> when he meets the <UNK> younger daughter who he sees as a double for <UNK> wife anthony also feels double crossed when haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder when haines is travelling alone in a train going to <UNK> he sees 2 men in the same <UNK> accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and anthony had br br the action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of robert walker and patricia hitchcock as the <UNK> younger daughter are particularly powerful
<START> the 1970s are often regarded as a golden age of british television comedy a period which saw numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows such as monty <UNK> flying circus the period was however <UNK> not a golden age of british film comedy and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen the most <UNK> exceptions to this rule were provided by the <UNK> but their best films monty python and the holy grail and life of brian were very different in conception to their tv show br br the main problem with adapting sitcoms for the cinema is that concepts <UNK> to fit the <UNK> 30 minute <UNK> 25 minutes on <UNK> which has to find room for commercials do not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four times as long few people will remember the film versions of say up or <UNK> and son with the same affection as the television versions in the case of many classic tv comedy shows some mothers do 'em yes minister <UNK> towers the <UNK> no attempt was made to film them at all for which we can be grateful characters such as michael <UNK> frank spencer or john <UNK> basil <UNK> can be hilarious in half hour doses but i doubt if they would remain as funny over two hours one comedy programme albeit a <UNK> of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense which might have worked in the cinema was the fall and rise of <UNK> but any hopes of a film were <UNK> by the <UNK> early death of its star leonard br br <UNK> army was one of the few television sitcoms of the period which was turned into a decent film about the only other one i can think of was <UNK> this was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well developed characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them the original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the <UNK> of a home guard platoon in the small <UNK> town of <UNK> on sea the home guard initially known as the local <UNK> <UNK> was an <UNK> <UNK> during world war ii made up for the most part of men too old to serve in the regular forces the film version is a three act drama act i deals with the <UNK> of the platoon and the <UNK> of its members in act ii they cause havoc during an army training exercise in act iii they succeed in capturing a group of nazi <UNK> whose plane has been shot down br br the three key players in this drama are the commander captain george arthur lowe and his two <UNK> sergeant arthur wilson john le <UNK> and <UNK> jack jones clive <UNK> who in <UNK> life is the local bank manager is a <UNK> little man <UNK> at the world through a pair of thick <UNK> it is he who takes the <UNK> in <UNK> the home guard unit and who <UNK> himself its commander he is pompous <UNK> with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own powers of <UNK> the sort of man who does not suffer fools gladly and in george world view the term fool covers most of the rest of the human race he does however have his good qualities he is motivated by a genuine patriotic <UNK> and is capable of great physical courage shown in his encounter with the germans br br wilson is deputy at the bank the two men are very different in character something <UNK> by a difference in appearance wilson being tall and thin whereas is short and <UNK> he comes across as being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss his accent suggests he may be a former public <UNK> nevertheless he has ended up playing second <UNK> both in <UNK> and military life probably because he has the sort of passive personality which leads to <UNK> and <UNK> and an inability to take anything altogether seriously jones is an old soldier who now runs the local <UNK> shop his promotion to <UNK> is due mainly to his ability to <UNK> with black market <UNK> his enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos although his <UNK> is don't panic he is prone to <UNK> at any given opportunity br br several other members of the platoon are featured private <UNK> the <UNK> scottish undertaker is even more of a <UNK> than wilson <UNK> we're doomed man doomed private <UNK> is a gentle old man whose main concern is the <UNK> of the nearest <UNK> private walker is a sharp cockney <UNK> and private <UNK> another bank employee a <UNK> <UNK> boy <UNK> mother is <UNK> mistress although wilson tries to keep this <UNK> secret from the <UNK> two significant <UNK> are the mild mannered <UNK> and the <UNK> warden <UNK> enemy and quite his equal in and br br there are occasional <UNK> <UNK>

jimmy perry would later go on to create comedy shows such as are you being served and hi de hi which were notorious for suggestive humour the film does however <UNK> much of the mixture of gentle wit nostalgia and sharp characterisation which made the tv series so successful 7 10
<START> i don't recommend watching this movie it's a movie in which a movie is being filmed with no attraction between actress and actor being played the sex scene at the end of the movie which is to explain the <UNK> of the actress being played in the movie to <UNK> with the actor being played in the movie in it is a blunt <UNK> of the same scene in the movie fat girl everything there was played with more <UNK> if you can <UNK> <UNK> to a sex act like that a typical french expression for the the thing happening in sex is comedy is oh la la in film brief crossing there also is sensitivity in sex is comedy i don't see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the movie is not being developed so that there is a rather loose story with the <UNK> of the end
<START> a couple of help a group of <UNK> cross some rough country on their way to a new <UNK> this low key western is unusual for ford in that it lacks any big stars johnson gets top billing but his is basically a supporting role although he and carey work well together <UNK> is given little to do other than provide the love interest the best performance is given by ford favorite bond playing the leader of the <UNK> in fact this role helped him land a starring role in the long running tv western <UNK> train before his <UNK> death at age <UNK> featuring beautiful cinematography ford regarded this as one of his favorite films
<START> i remember catching this movie on one of the showtime channels what stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in phoenix arizona i'm from there so i spot the locales easily br br regardless a ninja kills a scientist because they wear yellow <UNK> and golf who is pursued by the police it takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him there are no discernible bullet wounds his spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his <UNK> br br from then on she <UNK> gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja then another ninja from japan comes to kill the evil ninja this might be a plot device from the previous two films or perhaps a plot hole all i know is that this movie is very campy bad and entertaining this is something to watch with a <UNK> of popcorn and several friends and give it the mst3k treatment
<START> just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun this is a pure slice of the 1970s even the cops need <UNK> badly shot in and around london the plot of the american ex con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an <UNK> to a bank in <UNK> and then has the <UNK> put on by crime lord david niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well handled br br i liked its simplicity and even innocence it <UNK> back to a time when caper films where just that a caper and violence wasn't a part of the deal br br all in all you could do a lot worse than watch this it has enough twists and turns to give it some <UNK> and a cast that obviously had fun making it br br nicely made and watchable
<START> i like most other people saw this movie after hearing of it from <UNK> oddly enough it was easier to find than i thought it would be though it shouldn't come as a surprise that i found it used br br the plot is summed <UNK> masterfully within the title it's a bed that eats nothing more nothing less there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one br br a <UNK> blood ended up on a bed and as a result it becomes possessed it <UNK> anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then <UNK> it in what appears to be orange there is an artist who fell victim to the bed but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it <UNK> the narrative is told entirely through him br br this movie fails horribly at everything even at being bad still it's not without its own brand of charm
<START> sherlock holmes basil <UNK> and professor <UNK> lionel <UNK> engage in a battle of wits for control of a <UNK> <UNK> bomb sight creation holmes wants to <UNK> it for the british while <UNK> isn't above selling out to the nazis br br while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war time setting this particular film proves light hearted fun which doesn't <UNK> in wartime propaganda as it might well have done dennis inspector <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> dr watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief the <UNK> between holmes and is colorful and well thought out to boot <UNK> does well enough as <UNK> even if he's not as memorable as some others who played the role br br while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series it is a wonderful escape from reality somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more <UNK> less repetitive plot and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes
<START> before i begin let me get something off my chest i'm a huge fan of john first film project the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit <UNK> two sequels a spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph <UNK> a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  <UNK> kills three people while trying to rob a <UNK> store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where <UNK> talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael <UNK> a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up <UNK> his son's coach but once executed <UNK> returns as a or as kelly calls a <UNK> without the <UNK> whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making life a misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with <UNK> chasing <UNK> using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis <UNK> a french chef with an accent as bad as his <UNK> a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an <UNK> to death although that doesn't stop martin <UNK> from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay <UNK> back for killing <UNK> wife br br director john does not seem interested in <UNK> instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film's main flaw since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported <UNK> by <UNK> as well as paul <UNK> who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly is annoying as the <UNK> who tries to help but makes the situation worse
<START> jason lee does well to give this <UNK> movie fleeting promise but it's not enough to <UNK> it from any other bland family comedy br br this live action cg enhanced adventure sees a <UNK> police dog jason lee transformed into a super dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr simon peter underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret a challenge given that he can both talk and fly br br the odd gag raises a smile but human <UNK> james belushi and alex as father and son are as dull as the predictable storyline one for kids too young to have seen superman or spider man or even shaggy

<START> the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine <UNK> would operate i e ground air <UNK> and <UNK> as a team that's the season i give the high rating to true there are still a lot of liberties taken in season 1 but the stories were more believable br br the subsequent seasons were a <UNK> awful attempt of <UNK> place meets top gun br br i was a marine <UNK> at at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area i got to talk to rod <UNK> and james <UNK> br br <UNK> character was good to go br br <UNK> character was good in the first season only for some reason he <UNK> off after the first <UNK> of the second season br br if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team <UNK> then season one is the one to watch br br if you're into <UNK> place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to <UNK> them into top gun then see the last two seasons
<START> every now and then some amateur will come out with a tired piece of action film making this one is just so wrong i don't think i even need to comment about the plot acting script camera work because it have none if putting a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main <UNK> of making a great action movie then <UNK> action movie
<START> i've seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst my family bought the dvd <UNK> and couldn't even make it through the first half i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing it had been a christmas gift to me and was just appalled br br the only redeeming factor and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show is mark lin baker playing the mock turtle with a <UNK> accent it's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously other than that the songs are half songs the <UNK> are half <UNK> and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good

<START> like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm in fact so fond are said <UNK> memories that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to <UNK> that happy and <UNK> period of childhood <UNK> i used to sit utterly <UNK> as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey sandy and later <UNK> lung a horse dragon man you'll really need to watch it to understand when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday <UNK> as i recall br br well i'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i e more cynical eyes the show has lost none of its <UNK> charm br br simply wonderful entertainment from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects which actually serve to <UNK> the fun and of course not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season the passing of time has not in any way shape or form <UNK> any of <UNK> <UNK> charm br br as monkey himself would probably say you there go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun '
<START> hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person <UNK> their own business who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the <UNK> plot that's behind their troubles is resolved that way the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero we certainly do in this fine film barry kane is only trying to help his fellow man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration like helping <UNK> pick up the letters he dropped at the factory barry even returns a lost 100 bill to <UNK> later on that was big money in 1943 it's <UNK> acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon he's wrongly accused of <UNK> and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself similar to the <UNK> steps in plot the hero travels cross country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by cells an arch villain who nobody could believe to be a closet nazi and a beautiful blonde patricia martin who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane <UNK> trademark touches of humor are here too patricia is a <UNK> model who's various <UNK> ads are a help and comfort to barry as he <UNK> a ride with the bad guys all the way from las vegas to nyc we meet a <UNK> who's a one man comedy act someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three <UNK> a day field employees of the fascist spy ring about being forgotten or ignored by the suits just as if they were working for some <UNK> enterprise during a chase scene into a cinema audience members laugh at the action of a <UNK> comedy gangster flick as the <UNK> cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and kills a <UNK> movie <UNK> awful for the dead old man but funny <UNK> liked to use famous <UNK> in his movies and this is the best instance with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon it works even better than the <UNK> <UNK> scene in

<START> i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed br br basically dr crawford dennis hopper has predicted a meteor will hit the earth the powers that be don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people br br jake lowe peter <UNK> is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy <UNK> who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains he sets out to investigate br br while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives he spends the rest of his time <UNK> at dr crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor br br i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself br br don't waste your time on this turkey
<START> well the movie was no terrible but <UNK> created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of <UNK> this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born i suggest reading the book one of a kind the real <UNK> story they left out huge parts of his life they also at times did not understand the real that he was the actual facts of his life were at times out of order and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have so please don't watch the movie read the book by the way i'm not just some <UNK> who feels you have to stay 100 to the real story but they did not even come close
<START> hollywood <UNK> is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two <UNK> of the 20th century fox <UNK> don <UNK> and alice faye and containing a couple of in jokes br br the film concerns a max <UNK> type michael <UNK> <UNK> who brings an actress to hollywood molly <UNK> faye and makes her a big silent <UNK> eventually moving her into more dramatic roles he becomes extremely successful with her as his star obsessed with his work he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man alan curtis run off and get married he's so shocked he <UNK> her she and her husband go off and continue to be more and more popular while <UNK> studio starts losing money at an <UNK> rate before you know it he's through molly wants to help and asks that <UNK> direct her next film br br there's lots of <UNK> <UNK> type footage which is quite funny and some fantastic slapstick by buster keaton who is wonderful the film also has a scene from the jazz singer when the <UNK> take over the in joke of course has to do with <UNK> tin tin for whom <UNK> used to write in one scene <UNK> brings him in as a potential contract player for <UNK> studio <UNK> throws both of them out of his office a few scenes later <UNK> tin tin is shown to be 1 box office the role of the famous german shepherd in this film is played by <UNK> tin tin jr daddy having passed away in jean <UNK> arms in 1932 one month shy of his <UNK> birthday fortune <UNK> on him even at the end br br alice faye is very pretty and does a fine job as does <UNK> who turns in an energetic performance j edward and stuart <UNK> provide very good support br br unfortunately this film isn't quite sure what it is history comedy romance or drama however hollywood <UNK> is still quite watchable
<START> this film <UNK> demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply <UNK> in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused <UNK> in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was beautiful and touching it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian <UNK> but my this movie almost made it something i <UNK> the choreography the storyline the dialog the movie was a work of art br br the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman <UNK> <UNK> with her life and looking for something anything she is with a man who does not want a baby but she does he's not mean to her but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either i guess he doesn't really appreciate her all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym she meets another woman during her <UNK> training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years and they have stayed close friends br br the relationship that unfolds is i don't know quite the word but very understanding comfortable intimate but sexy something that could only exist between two women the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life someone that makes you feel special exciting beautiful confused even br br the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way they have a close and intimate relationship her friend showed me what a true friend really is someone who is understanding easy going real fun to be with someone who is there for you no matter what someone who is supportive and you can <UNK> with and tell your deepest secrets someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets br br the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone but not <UNK> in any way it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments the dancing and choreography was stunning i could watch it over and over the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch what a <UNK> a wonderful story i fell in love with this movie if you have a chance rent this and watch it
<START> and believe me that's a pretty stunning accomplishment take jolly roger massacre at <UNK> <UNK> change the killer from a pirate to a <UNK> change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold and his color from <UNK> green to deep blue you now have <UNK> massacre the problem is at least jolly roger was entertaining enough albeit in a so bad it's good way to keep you watching it for the whole two hours there's no strip joint murder scene or any bizarre killings i can't tell you how many times i lost interest in <UNK> massacre and started doing <UNK> or cleaning around the <UNK> and the ending is absolutely silly the dude just randomly re appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the <UNK> <UNK> screaming a truly horrible movie
<START> in the original french version the jokes of great funny voice are very funny br br but in translated versions i saw the german english version it's not half good than the original br br but goof special effects almost the full comic with differences like the figure of german name is placed in an other comic book br br sure the <UNK> comic book are cult but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes better story and the old and flair of the cult stories br br for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it's original version with or without subtitles where available in different languages
<START> i'm sorry but for a movie that has been so <UNK> as a semi classic and a scary movie but seriously i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally that's not a good thing the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable i just couldn't stop laughing at voice it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's british voice not to mention over dramatic stick up his butt character br br children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that <UNK> them to sacrifice any 20 aged people when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed but has other intentions when he is sick of following orders br br children of the corn could've been something great but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of as much as i love stephen king i'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story or at least the actors destroyed it like i said for a good laugh watch it but i'm warning you it's pretty pathetic br br 3 10
<START> once a wise man from india once said first they will laugh at us then they will hate us then they will fear us know that yes this film's budget was a bit off but even then with its story still takes our interest many <UNK> later regardless of how it may have looked but know soon in due time thrust will <UNK> to the big screen once again then he and the new <UNK> t rex will more then shock you it will scare many for centuries to come this film is in current pre production and will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before br br this will be beyond <UNK> format right into 4 <UNK> format br br be afraid be very afraid
<START> since jason and his <UNK> took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of <UNK> charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the <UNK> and not the suspense br br this little film is different made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner then you make those horrors <UNK> just don't turn it into a lesson on the <UNK> of <UNK> br br the story features meg <UNK> right before she had a short lived turn with fame starting with the big chill and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's meg plays an <UNK> teenager who is just dying to get into the good <UNK> of some classic mean girls they tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt the mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward further <UNK> the <UNK> girl and having an excuse to reject her br br meanwhile famed <UNK> karl has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers his daughter doesn't believe this at first but she <UNK> to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to <UNK> bigger game and draw further power from these animations she also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead i think you know where this story is headed so i'll stop here did i mention the magician was <UNK> in the same crypt in which meg <UNK> character is spending the night br br i will mention that the commercial dvd containing this film does look somewhat <UNK> compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently i saw it on tv in the mid 1980's and i remember it looking better than this the problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the dvd had to be created from a print this means it comes complete with dirt and <UNK> br br this is worth checking out for any horror fan it was an <UNK> made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could <UNK> find on late night tv until the <UNK> turned that time <UNK> into a vast <UNK> circa 1986 only tcm underground <UNK> this kind of film anymore
<START> i bought this movie just to see <UNK> because i was really loving him but after seeing this i don't like him much i mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary <UNK> scenes i was just saying to myself alright we know you're a professional <UNK> now can we get back to ryan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and brandon really made the movie in my perspective br br i noticed that obviously and <UNK> were both in <UNK> but who <UNK> was dating at the time anyways i actually enjoyed <UNK> and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen it's sort of in it's own category
<START> this is no walk in the park i saw this when it came out and haven't had the guts to watch it again you will never see a more <UNK> devastating or depressing movie i felt like i'd been severely beaten what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage this is our world what we have created what we have allowed to happen and i would hesitate to say that i me we are not responsible for this made this film to wake us up to shake us to our very core and he succeeded how can we be cruel or self indulgent or <UNK> of our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior he is pointing a finger of <UNK> at us all for doing this to the <UNK> and least powerful of our society and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it then you are part of the problem i am not a religious fanatic but this movie made me think about the state of my soul
<START> the academy award winning vs follows a <UNK> businessman ted kramer dustin hoffman and his divorce with his bored wife meryl streep one day ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life forcing ted to become closer to his son justin henry the two bond and become very close but only after some <UNK> and just as everything is going perfect ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him and fights his wife in court dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep and young justin henry is impressive it's a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie but it's a very well made and inspiring film the film took the oscar for best picture at the 1979 academy awards along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep if you don't mind a <UNK> vs is a great film to watch grade b
<START> i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and i couldn't put it down until the end and i had forgotten about my horrid day and the ending by the way where is the sequel br br the budget is obviously extremely low but look what they did with it it reminds me of a play they are basically working with a <UNK> a a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing that is it for props maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their <UNK> place in film as the centers of the work instead of as <UNK> used to have an excuse to make cgi fights br br the cgi is fine it is not exactly but imho it still works why because there isn't too much of it and what there is is not <UNK> <UNK> with an army of effects house people trying to <UNK> everything they can into the shot it <UNK> the imagination it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition especially the heavy <UNK> shot there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds that tracks the entire length of the ship it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0 75 seconds and some relation to the story it might look old or not <UNK> of the <UNK> but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story br br the acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them the captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take i also got confused with his character losing his cool and <UNK> on a corpse i like to think <UNK> are calm cool and in control what was going on in that scene did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment did he feel himself losing control br br now as for the plot mostly it is good why because it doesn't try to explain itself it just happens it's called 'the <UNK> its a mystery get it nobody knows why there is a statue and they don't find out either the mysterious cult the weird scientist with the <UNK> what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes this isn't war and peace and thank god it's not star wars trek either no no 5 minutes of <UNK> boring dialog that has no purpose in the story the characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's <UNK> <UNK> or a child like space <UNK> it is mysterious and i liked that i don't know why maybe i can identify with these guys more since they don't know whats happening and i don't either they don't talk a lot of space <UNK> or have magic boxes telling them what is happening br br in fact i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc this <UNK> has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it <UNK> the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene br br ok sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious though like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning that was odd just weird the <UNK> ending again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end this is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel imagine hamlet with no of angels sing <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> br br anyways what can i say this was well worth the dollar i <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> machine at the supermarket it was also imho a better piece of storytelling than parts 1 2 or 3 like i said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and i couldn't stop watching until the end
<START> agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show i remember the series well as i was in the florida keys when the show had its debut i was looking through old vcr tapes that were <UNK> and came across two that had about eight episodes i ended up spending part of christmas night and the next watching these shows the singer was saw his name come up on the credits he's from and owns a beach front bar called the <UNK> <UNK> he's a longtime friend of jimmy <UNK> and classic song still in paradise is featured on the latest <UNK> cd dvd <UNK> called live in it is track 12 on cd 1 and 8 on the cd i too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on dvd keep the faith
<START> i really wanted to like this film but it barely <UNK> out a 3 it's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10 the other half 1 all the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off sebastian <UNK> is appealing charismatic and likable he even physically resembles marc anthony in a more <UNK> yet ultimately conscious sort of way but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death the banana scene on self <UNK> seemingly showing how much movement was in his <UNK> but in his defense it was his first movie as director that i'm aware of and i appreciate his labor of love it just left me empty despite what was trying to be said ultimately i think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director from what i've seen of the there is a real story behind this and perhaps when i finish watching them i'll appreciate this attempt more
<START> it was so very long ago 1960 but i have never forgotten this series and often wished it would <UNK> so taken with it i <UNK> with mr then president of standard oil which <UNK> the presentation on <UNK> he sent me a photo of the <UNK> actually a <UNK> rendering used behind the credits br br to the opening theme music of <UNK> <UNK> my family and i gathered around our black white tv to drink in shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players at least to american audiences at the time br br we were introduced to such actors as sean connery dame <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> patrick garland julian glover and robert hardy i have continued to enjoy their <UNK> ever since one of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as shakespeare's king plays were presented perhaps for the first time in <UNK> order br br i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me br br if age of kings could be <UNK> on vhs and or dvd it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around br br good news <UNK> has just <UNK> a dvd of an age of kings see their july 2009 <UNK> page 19 or call them <UNK> free i just ordered mine
<START> as a true canadian i always avoid canadian movies however now and then i get trapped into watching one this one is better than most which is to say mediocre it has many of the usual flaws of canadian films self conscious acting an excess of cinematic gimmicks and above all the self <UNK> canadian habit of using canadian cities as stand ins for american ones i mean using the historic metropolis of <UNK> as a stand in for <UNK> is just short of obscene i was in a generous mood i gave it a 4 br br

<START> this is a great movie too bad it is not available on home video
<START> this film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a hollywood blockbuster as i recall and it's a few years since i've seen the film the action starts with a london <UNK> filled with people there is an horrific crash and one passenger dies the rest of the film is then told in flashback with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail at the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these <UNK> vivid characters has met a gruesome end great stuff a little like a good <UNK> news story fleshed out in precise even handed detail if only it were available on video
<START> possible spoilers br br the sixth halloween film is an utterly depressing affair but unfortunately not in the manner <UNK> by the filmmakers by now everyone knows the story of how it was butchered and released in such a sloppy incoherent form the second half in particular makes little to no sense as plot elements are introduced and dropped seemingly at random the very ending left me scratching my head what the hell happened is dr <UNK> dead or what this is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture it's not a pretty sight br br on a related note this is the most <UNK> violent entry in the series i have no problem with gore if it's in the right place but this movie takes it to absurd levels the infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series michael himself even seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being inconsistent with his efficient <UNK> approach in the john carpenter original br br i'm not quite sure who was responsible director joe or the producers probably a combination of both i'd be perfectly happy to grant a <UNK> to all concerned if only they'd release the legendary <UNK> cut a more complete version of the film that is a vast improvement from every account from what i understand it's like a different movie altogether i offer to pay full price to purchase the dvd if <UNK> comes to its senses and releases it br br there are a handful of good elements however the idea of michael being controlled by the <UNK> is intriguing paul rudd is solid as tommy doyle whose appearance is a neat tie in with the original the slick visuals help make the proceedings a bit more watchable but these <UNK> offerings are overshadowed by the <UNK> of drivel we have to put up with br br finally the curse of michael myers is noted for being donald <UNK> last film many of his scenes were <UNK> from the final cut and when he does appear he seems <UNK> and unhappy the movie is dedicated to his memory a blatant if unintentional insult if there was ever one the fact that a talented performer should end his career like this is too depressing to even think about br br 1 2 out of br br released by dimension films
<START> this is the most frightening film ever made in hollywood it is a <UNK> tale of how to take a european masterpiece and suck the life of of it until it is a dry <UNK> like an <UNK> <UNK> on the the frightening because it reveals how the world of hollywood really works ignorant money <UNK> <UNK> it makes me wonder how many great films could <UNK> the corridors of my memory if the hollywood process had not <UNK> them to forgettable mediocrity cry for the murdered children see <UNK> or read the golden egg if you dare because they will come back to you forever in the <UNK> moments of your life when you're walking along the street and you see a <UNK> poster in ordinary looking parking lots when you hear the tour de france on the radio and especially when you you think what's the harm in wearing a <UNK> with a hole in it on a perfectly ordinary day br br if only i could give this a zero
<START> this film is absolute gold if you haven't seen it do <UNK> <UNK> himself once again this film introduced me to <UNK> <UNK> as well though everyone shines in this movie my only regret is i've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs we are led from the jungle of northern <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of southern india as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story the <UNK> is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book lovely watch it
<START> it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour bizarre characters etc a case in point are a great number of horror sci fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era they are enjoyable for genre buffs and guilty pleasure <UNK> because their badness is entertaining however this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the <UNK> 1978 original br br i suppose in 1995 it was the <UNK> of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum now in the mid <UNK> with the c s i shows tv's an absolute blood fest good for us horror fans br br william <UNK> and alexandra paul are no <UNK> <UNK> and heather <UNK> the original 1978 stars it's not and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie i won't say how because that is part of the plot br br this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but <UNK> as good horror as can be seen from the user votes here stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie
<START> pretty funny stuff charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the <UNK> of world war one daring because after all the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business br br the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear <UNK> one successful scene follows another as chaplin and his <UNK> try to sleep in a <UNK> that is <UNK> deep in water that's where we got the term <UNK> foot from probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and <UNK> any number of german soldiers as they try to <UNK> an allied soldier caught behind the lines <UNK> <UNK> main squeeze at the time is a woman who with the americans and is saved from execution too br br chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period
<START> i don't understand how some people can stand playing half life counter strike when there are so many better first person shooting games available br br counter strike is a game that doesn't use any imaginative ideas in its <UNK> all the weapons in the game are real life weapons but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon like the all powerful <UNK> in the <UNK> doom games br br another problem is that the player actually has to <UNK> the weapon <UNK> this can become extremely annoying especially while in the middle of a <UNK> when you are so close to killing the enemy the <UNK> <UNK> also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its task br br there are not many choices of characters to choose from if i remember correctly there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and counter terrorist forces this means that many of the characters look the same as each other which really brings down the <UNK> realism br br the game is pretty sexist when it comes to character <UNK> in the early version of counter strike there was a woman available to choose in the terrorist force selection which was good for the female <UNK> in the latest versions however the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character i wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versions br br finally the <UNK> in the game are very small the biggest map seems to be the desert map but it has standard detail in fact all the <UNK> in the game have standard graphics in other words nothing new br br to sum up i think half life counter strike is the most un imaginative first person shooting game of all time there are plenty of better more imaginative shooting games to play so why waste your time on this boring game you're better off playing the unreal <UNK> <UNK> and doom games avoid this over rated over hyped game br br i give the game a 1 10
<START> i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals but this <UNK> image from <UNK> was still quite a drag the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing not just its creature but acting writing and any attempts at drama the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from <UNK> <UNK> and danny <UNK> never really works predictable often laughable whilst it delivers less <UNK> than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse the actors do their best but with such material their <UNK> efforts have little effect matthew <UNK> burke is a <UNK> watchable hero meredith <UNK> similar as a <UNK> watchable love interest actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace but its biggest plus is that the <UNK> isn't entirely cgi rendered so even though it doesn't look good at least there are a few <UNK> scenes of characters <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> in pretty amusing fashion i also <UNK> at the <UNK> between different <UNK> of the <UNK> the cgi shots of the creature as a whole <UNK> over the course of the film they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it and there are scenes where the <UNK> action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an <UNK> and just <UNK> their creature as a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty <UNK> but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things like a boat and a <UNK> yes these scenes are poor but they did make me chuckle highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the <UNK> takes on a new york landmark the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired and well worth looking up on youtube apart from that things are uninspired all round a pg level lack of gore or <UNK> stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were <UNK> from the stallone flick daylight which by my <UNK> is quite good altogether this was pretty <UNK> stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die <UNK> better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick but not by much
<START> this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene however the movie can be considered great for many reasons not the least of which is its true gritty portrayal of <UNK> and pain in the family of a working class soviet family i would definitely recommend it
<START> the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game <UNK> at to have created this sequel all the characters are brilliant the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny a lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote keep up the good work
<START> has anyone ever read or heard comments by scorsese or david chase <UNK> <UNK> producer about death collector family <UNK> i bought the dvd after not having seen it for a while on cable like 20 years but having seen <UNK> and the entire sopranos run to date in retrospect both guys must have seen death collector family <UNK> and absorbed the flavor perhaps inspiring the tone for their <UNK> both of which the polar opposite of the <UNK> godfather trilogy being a jersey guy it is interesting to see how the jersey <UNK> have evolved since the mid 70's it is not the <UNK> <UNK> ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local <UNK> also it's a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed world trade center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene who could have imagined
<START> master plan have the winning team in a deadly <UNK> one of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous enter the dragon from '73 this one is an effort from south africa the <UNK> <UNK> is a bit different appearing as a white castle like <UNK> in the middle of the desert from a distance the villain himself a baron or general is a slightly more perverse version of the dr no or han mold of master <UNK> having strange flashbacks to the glory days of nazi germany he does wear the full <UNK> nazi uniform at some points his main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition <UNK> against his japanese rival an <UNK> of their <UNK> in the 2nd world war my army is better than your army it sounds silly and it is though the suggestion of madness and crazed <UNK> almost works the central hero steve chase ryan resembles a white <UNK> character having a similarly lean <UNK> <UNK> though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise i thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not he and his girlfriend have joined the <UNK> team of fighters but decide to quit what did they think they were getting into of course it's not that easy there's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a <UNK> car with a <UNK> <UNK> those desert winds can do wonders for travel it seems br br the plot kind of <UNK> in the 2nd half as the hero joins the team of the <UNK> <UNK> and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell under threat of rape by the hero's rival the most interesting character turns out to be <UNK> a dwarf who is the <UNK> assistant he's loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero much of the fighting <UNK> the ballet like <UNK> of the hero with a lot of <UNK> and slow motion the sound fx are also <UNK> up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows there are a few good fights during the <UNK> towards the climax but none really stand out if one had to pick i suppose the best involves the <UNK> muscle man henchman of the baron introduced late in the story he lifts the back of a car at one point you wonder how the hero will take him out at the end since the <UNK> seems to <UNK> off most of the punches the acting is very mediocre <UNK> into camp as far as the girlfriend who tends to laugh for no reason as if she's high on grass though she is very cute some of the training scenes are also campy especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert <UNK> and with such a title there's surprisingly few actual killings ryan as steve chase returned as a traditional agent in the sequel kill and kill again hero 4 villain 4 femme <UNK> 4 henchmen 6 fights 6 stunts chases 4 <UNK> 2 auto 3 locations 5 pace 5 overall 4
<START> robert altman's <UNK> is a dreary gloomy hard to follow thriller where you finally give up after awhile because it's so complicated br br i remember seeing this at my local twin on opening weekend with a full house by the time the picture ended it was less than a quarter full never have i witnessed such a mass <UNK> without there being an <UNK> to drive people out that should tell you how bad it is i believe it to be the worst film ever made involving such major talent in front of and behind the camera
<START> <UNK> <UNK> mr bean ranks right up there with laurel hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy <UNK> i have never seen people laugh out loud so <UNK> and literally fall out of their <UNK> as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i'll never forget the first time my brother saw him he was over for a visit and i asked him if he'd ever seen mr bean who he said so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard he became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh <UNK> it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist <UNK> the christmas episode a classic plus kids love it and the new year party <UNK> <UNK> is a comic genius
<START> the <UNK> opens to shots of a <UNK> racing along a highway it catches up with an old pick up truck and gets held up as it <UNK> past the pick up the driver benjamin j perry as ben perry shouts <UNK> and <UNK> his horn distracted he doesn't notice an <UNK> ahead and crashes his <UNK> he is quickly freed from the <UNK> and is taken to hospital on the way the <UNK> randy <UNK> trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it then the <UNK> is attacked and forced off the road by a van the driver of the van jackson jim as james f beats the <UNK> up and steals the patient the <UNK> driver harry charles makes no attempt to stop him once the injured man has been placed into the van jackson turns his attention to harry whom seem to know each other harry asks jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw <UNK> <UNK> jackson punches harry to the floor and throws a <UNK> of money at him the film then makes it perfectly clear we are in san <UNK> by showing a shot of the golden gate bridge sharon raymond is <UNK> up by a phone call for her boyfriend dr john david allen brooks to inform him that his mother amanda kim hunter who has recently had a heart attack has <UNK> consciousness works for a company called the and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called shelter <UNK> and destroy all of her notes and experiments especially the which has never heard of she also claims that he has a brother named anthony back at talks with a dr phillip lloyd rod <UNK> about his mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called anthony he claims he knows nothing when amanda dies after a visit from the sinister dr lloyd decides to carry out his mothers request and try to find out who anthony is while paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named melissa

julia <UNK> plus a girl with a <UNK> named <UNK> valentine z great name what were her parents thinking they get down to business straight away but find little of any interest for some reason no one at

when hart is attacked by something in a <UNK> decides he must destroy all <UNK> of his mothers work and whatever anthony is <UNK> co written and directed by <UNK> carpenter and <UNK> <UNK> carpenter also acted as cinematographer and <UNK> as producer this is a pretty poor film in my opinion the script is credited to five writers carpenter <UNK> earl john penny and joseph <UNK> and with five people working on it i'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this nothing is explained that well why did amanda create these monstrous sea creature human <UNK> what is dr <UNK> interest and his motives why does he steal bodies from the back of why does he have a basement full of mutants why do none of these so called genetic scientists think to check the basement out could melissa act more <UNK> even if she tried why are none of the characters given any background why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called when 99 9 of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about there is also a serious lack of blood and gore only one person dies on screen just one and all the scientists survive in a vomit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is a horror film guys all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways the one on screen death is actually quite cool someone has slimy <UNK> inserted under their skin in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence to try and up the gore there is a scene where dr lloyd is <UNK> on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing melissa also turns into a fish don't ask there's no nudity either which isn't a surprise the film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and <UNK> along at a <UNK> pace we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late when it does make an appearance the effects are ok and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total what's the world coming too
<START> people call a party line to talk dirty to strangers and perhaps meet up for a sexual <UNK> a deranged somewhat incestuous sister and occasional <UNK> brother use the line to find people to kill usually married men but they don't <UNK> a pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun pretending to be older of course one of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her or anyone br br meanwhile a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the victims he's teamed with a female assistant of the district attorney br br nothing too special here richard <UNK> has little more than a cameo as the police chief one of the dirty talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced <UNK> character <UNK> patty according to the imdb the other died quite young just several years after this movie sad
<START> oh <UNK> one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies i don't even remember how many i've seen maybe it sells but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these also the pulling of the kid i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies <UNK> scene is also nothing new the of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked i mean it lacked all ok this is for kids 14 16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique we'll let me tell you there's a million of you d this is one of them 3 10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by not seeing this
<START> they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven <UNK> a 3 foot fence the plot is barely there the acting so to speak is <UNK> and the action is <UNK> lame this is the worst seagal film ever and that is saying something
<START> we watched this movie in my chemistry class so obviously it had educational value i thought the film did a really good job of <UNK> the subjects of the science moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project but wasn't exactly focused on strong acting i would recommend this movie for the <UNK> inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind fat man and little boy but if the subject of nuclear bombs <UNK> you don't see it
<START> michael <UNK> character has problems he's a plain insecure man in his mid 40s he's married but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore he has a poor relationship with his only daughter but his most immediate problem is that a stunningly beautiful young woman played by michelle johnson is pursuing him too <UNK> kissing him <UNK> him and trying to <UNK> sex at every opportunity what's the poor fellow to do br br this movie should be taken out of the comedy section and placed under science fiction only an <UNK> brain chip can explain the actions of michelle <UNK> character let's see 3 billion men in the world she can pretty much have her pick she goes with an clumsy aging loser this goes beyond a middle aged male fantasy into something so <UNK> you just hope that everyone involved <UNK> <UNK> to therapy br br there's not really anything funny here there are some quick attempts at wit from caine who often seems to playing <UNK> pierce more than a new character joseph <UNK> is like <UNK> on a <UNK> michelle johnson is no actress she has one crying scene that wouldn't pass <UNK> in a high school play but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off so buy the dvd skip to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest
<START> 35 years after this was made castro still <UNK> unfortunately we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim witted maniac played by scenery chewing jack palance made it as far as 1960 i stumbled back across this recently and was amused at <UNK> the <UNK> sid <UNK> and b movie favorite paul <UNK> among the rebels <UNK> was obviously well past his prime when he directed this <UNK> some of the lines are classic in a did he really say that kind of way ' the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound not the dialog are actually excellent the only first rate elements of the entire production so don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun
<START> a <UNK> but funny bit of <UNK> you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening but each report to earth has it's own little joke pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci fi t v show it's fun to watch sort of in the vein of red dwarf but even more low budget for someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because they've been moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died also the main guys are from the <UNK> <UNK> which is why they have <UNK> in everything if you like red dwarf you'll probably like this slightly different t v concept in that all you see is the report each day br br it would be better if this were explained more not just in the very beginning of the first episode but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too if you hadn't been told
<START> i saw this movie today on the big screen and i can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people on here i was really hoping to be touched by this film but wasn't br br i'm ex australian army and very patriotic towards this great country but i feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battle br br the movie is poorly filmed i thought the acting was terrible they were not believable and they didn't give me any reason for me to care about them people are saying this movie was graphic there were a couple of graphic scenes but i found most part very weak the war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutes br br overall a weak film that doesn't do these soldiers any justice
<START> the film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy instead hot summer in <UNK> county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest <UNK> the <UNK> though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly the film is very tame it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating what's more the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is <UNK> amateurish this film was probably intended for the drive in crowd but it's unlikely that it satisfied them even in 1974
<START> this was a crappy miserably acted movie based on <UNK> male fantasies a shame that it was based in texas an otherwise excellent state i would recommend this movie to no one and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as i am now so irritated that i wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it
<START> not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen br br looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn't mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the <UNK> homicide squad again
<START> let's get one thing straight this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale but out of the bad movie scale this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous <UNK> and by everyone else br br i went in with one promise from the movie that there will be snakes on a train and it delivers br br the gore itself is really good and the characters have awesome roles come on it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls <UNK> drugs even a <UNK> engineer getting his <UNK> on you get to see some topless nudity explosions snakes gore and a mexican main lead running around <UNK> his girlfriend by hitting his crack <UNK> and blowing the smoke in her face as i mentioned and many others have the movie pacing is a bit off but respectable nonetheless br br movies like this keep our group tradition of <UNK> together and all <UNK> in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie br br it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock down or <UNK> vs python but those are some big shoes to fill br br a solid 7 out of 10
<START> it's a beautiful film the scenes are well <UNK> anne <UNK> 's dialogs are really well written and inspiring the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful br br mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses br br elizabeth taylor looks very pretty her scenes in the film are <UNK> poetic the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her <UNK> beautiful br br this movie has great spirit and a beloved <UNK> classic br br angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though <UNK> if you have seen her in role of <UNK> in 'the <UNK> <UNK> br br donald crisp has done his father's role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role br br its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an <UNK> christmas favorite
<START> to tell you the truth i do not speak <UNK> and i did not understand the film my good <UNK> friend wow what a long name explained every thing to me what a great movie after watching this movie i felt i should have watched many more movies from <UNK> <UNK> film industry the war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful the actress what a beauty give her an award for best looking someone <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> come on i smell a oscar winner i didnt understand the songs but they were excellent <UNK> is a great director and i hope his next film was a success
<START> i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my <UNK> i wasn't disappointed when i got it as it's just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drive in theater back then br br it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> america on <UNK> this was a strange comedic role for william <UNK> as i remember him as kennedy in the 1974 tv film the <UNK> of october and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he did br br it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in cold where van dyke played the local minister role as mayor minister and <UNK> was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and real br br howard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the spoiled family in the <UNK> was on target for the time as well anyone who has traveled across country with small children are we there yet will appreciate those scenes br br the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns it's sad that many small towns disappeared because of the <UNK> system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive used <UNK> animals anyone br br all in all it's a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80's well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer
<START> the one thing i really can't seem to forget about this movie is its beginning classic comedy brilliantly crafted i love it see it for yourself no spoilers here the <UNK> between <UNK> and crystal also <UNK> in this movie with <UNK> as the perfect <UNK> son one of my favourites highly recommended for fans of crystal
<START> here we have a miniseries which <UNK> in in its flaws and doesn't make us cringe because of them it is excellent story telling which <UNK> black comedy in a positive way the pathetic waste of war without the sheer <UNK> manipulation of a con job like life is beautiful it is an entertainment not the meaning of life and showcases the talents of actors both young and old give it a go and tell us what you think
<START> i'm one of those for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days i still will check them out every once in a while my observation is that most of them aren't very funny even the ones on major networks that are getting high ratings i just don't get who is finding them gut <UNK> funny while a few have made me crack a smile none of them made me laugh out loud i usually change the channel after a few minutes now on the fox network they <UNK> out new shows like changing your underwear for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom wrong dead wrong they have beat this dead horse so much it is to the point of hiring just anyone they can find to write a crappy pilot with bad dialog and just <UNK> them out let's take a brief look at the latest piece of junk that fox has <UNK> out called the war at home br br i watched about 5 minutes of it and that was generous in this particular episode the daughter is <UNK> off to her parents doing the i'm an adult now rant the dad gets fed up tells her ok fine go ahead and do whatever you want if you screw up it's your problem to which she replies well i guess your mad but hey at least i didn't get aids cue the laugh track no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud such garbage i found the crack about not having aids to be in such bad taste well hey at least i don't have to watch any more of this crap take a hint fox stop wasting your time with sitcoms ok well you have the simpsons but it is now getting really old and tired as well
<START> i'm a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions the episode hero is an example of what i mean br br the story as it eventually <UNK> is that the <UNK> deliberately allow <UNK> a pilot captured several years earlier during a black <UNK> mission to escape steal a <UNK> ship and get back to galactica the plan is that when <UNK> gets back he will figure out that <UNK> left him to his fate and be so <UNK> that he will kill <UNK> which he very nearly does br br now the problem is this the <UNK> set it up so that <UNK> thinks he has escaped by himself this means that <UNK> gets off the <UNK> ship with no assistance so he kills a <UNK> and walks out of his holding cell that much we see then we must suppose that he walks to the flight <UNK> manages to get into a <UNK> fighter ship and learn how to operate it takes off and flies back to galactica just like that br br now <UNK> managed to get one of them working in season one which was barely believable in itself but she only had to fly it visually out of <UNK> before making contact with galactica <UNK> has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through <UNK> and manages to catch up with galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction how does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology <UNK> connect to their computers by touch there are no visual <UNK> or <UNK> and having managed that <UNK> feat how does he then know where galactica is bearing in mind that galactica took off some 3 years before and is trying ever since to <UNK> the <UNK> it does not leave behind even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any sci fi show this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever
<START> for fans of chris <UNK> this is probably his best film david spade plays the perfect cynical sarcastic <UNK> to baby <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> achieves <UNK> of comic genius in his monologues like the let's say you're driving along the road with your family bit the jo jo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet his possible sale speech or the <UNK> <UNK> guarantee fairy <UNK> pad sale the sappy moments in the film contrast <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> even after many viewings it's still fun to see <UNK> pour everything he had into the role richard what's happening to me
<START> i don't think i've ever gave something a 1 10 rating but this one easily gets the <UNK> i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes it's not just that the jokes are so bad but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma can't set up or finish a punchline and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach br br i have watched the show never in its entirety but many times still it just creeps up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever br br actually if you ever do see him <UNK> a guest it's just that an interview i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming get me the hell away from this freak i do recommend watching the show not for a laugh but to <UNK> how he got on the air and what he's still doing there watch as much as you can i think you will find its complete <UNK> interesting
<START> i just re watched <UNK> ms gundam for the 2nd time it is so much better than gundam wing i can't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series this is great to see the <UNK> actually move about clumsily through the land somebody really thought over writing this move script br br see this today
<START> this rendition of <UNK> <UNK> has set and <UNK> reputation back about 100 years however the production has it's bright side a learning experience for <UNK> movie in how not to make a movie br br where in the <UNK> of biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations br br ok boys let's <UNK> up it's too bad that god created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night we're not kissing we're only <UNK> in each <UNK> mouths br br <UNK> for building the <UNK> with georgia pacific <UNK> on it metal nails kids flying <UNK> a <UNK> how can james coburn sleep after this selling chinese hats pirates attacking a wooden <UNK> which they wished to capture with <UNK> <UNK> balls of fire shot from glass <UNK> of wine <UNK> was in a <UNK> state of it was a miracle that he could see the <UNK> let alone build it lady mary in a blond wig <UNK> around the <UNK> on a white horse still rated g off biblical pirates with an iron <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pan landing on <UNK> after having passed through the <UNK> of <UNK> br br etc etc etc br br special effects you've got to see them in order not to believe them br br the list goes on this movie must not be missed but if you want the full tv version you must call nbc for the screen version but only if you agree to <UNK> nbc of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place only the <UNK> version exists in video stores no pirates etc that is those video stores that dare to stock it br br marvin <UNK> br br
<START> there is an interesting split in the voting for this movie at the moment at least those who go expecting a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed i <UNK> that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re <UNK> of the invasion of <UNK> br br so if you want to see actors <UNK> and gore this film will not suit you if you want to see an independent documentary about <UNK> without bias towards any one side the only enemy in these events was the war itself then you'll come away both impressed and i found it a very moving film and even quite liked captain guy <UNK> by the end
<START> the russian space station with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re enter the <UNK> atmosphere in a matter of days russia asks for help in <UNK> the stranded crew and <UNK> <UNK> the space <UNK> atlantis the <UNK> also have an interest in the a prototype <UNK> power source being tested aboard and <UNK> for one of their men to be placed on the mission br br that's the plot onto less important things the space station and the <UNK> are the same blatantly obvious models used in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and a handful of other films i suspect the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy and the and claim the insurance the script has a few good moments including farewell and the little <UNK> at the end but is otherwise fairly bland and sub standard the acting is okay the only real standout performance comes from alex who offers up some of the film's better dialogue michael <UNK> is surprisingly one of the best parts about this film ice t is ice t <UNK> said the film offers a few surprises though that i don't wish to spoil br br certainly one of the better low grade contemporary set sci fi films of the last six years but not the best the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off rent the other sci fi film instead
<START> let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's which the decline of western civilization documents with the exception of x and black flag being more of new york and english punk guy after i saw this movie that completely changed the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street <UNK> through their <UNK> but it is a great display of <UNK> at it's best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll one of the best scenes and actually most insightful is the interview with claude of catholic discipline or <UNK> as he was known to slash magazine readers originally from france he <UNK> about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk or <UNK> attitude to music politics and life in general <UNK> crash of the <UNK> comes off as a complete idiot most of the time but the performance of is pretty decent complete with a young pat <UNK> black performance with <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> it was filmed a couple of years before henry <UNK> joined the band is decent and x and fear give the best performances in the movie look out for the interviews with the young punk kids you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary highly recommended
<START> surface is one of the greatest t v series i have seen the acting is great and the storyline enthralling each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next i especially thought carter <UNK> who played miles bennett did a superb job he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work br br i can't believe surface only made one season once again the public has let me down it is hard to <UNK> that a great shows like this one would get canceled while crap reality shows continue on year after year whoever made the decision to <UNK> this show really dropped the ball on this one
<START> the <UNK> 1976 is an extraordinary <UNK> account of the fight against the nazis in german occupied the <UNK> reflects the russian obsession with the horrors of the great patriotic war but unusually is both <UNK> in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great russian <UNK> the true battle is not with the nazis who <UNK> in the background as mere extras but between the russian nazi investigator and the captured <UNK> who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death with its many references to the <UNK> the story takes on heroic proportions <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> and his influence on future generations a remarkable piece of work
<START> wow an amazing lost piece of and a lost 70s <UNK> rock film rolled into one this film <UNK> viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm as a retelling of the oz story the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's <UNK> the chance for a glimpse at how <UNK> rock <UNK> in australia will delight fans of the genre this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show an <UNK> of the type of film that oz is while not as <UNK> or well constructed as it's hard not to have fun with oz br br surprisingly oz has aged well perhaps a by product of how <UNK> set in the real australia of 1976 it is the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream the <UNK> of the film to give <UNK> to gay characters is notable especially as it dates to the period for the australian gay rights push br br the performances range from amateur to finely nuanced brilliance the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have <UNK> from an extra draft or two somehow these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully <UNK> much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm br br there are several connections to the original australian of the rocky horror show which will keep <UNK> on their <UNK> br br oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion swing along with the soundtrack leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight
<START> and that's saying a lot rent this if you want to be <UNK> by <UNK> blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts direction and casting in the history of films i'm <UNK> i can't believe i watched it i'm a big <UNK> peters fan normally but this tested my resolve don't read any more reviews here it's best if you know nothing about the plot just rent it you won't believe what you're seeing
<START> this <UNK> seems to have <UNK> opinions amongst the <UNK> on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie how bad is it it's a <UNK> that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda it's known in britain as lust for murder and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name and can i also point out that it's not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed br br i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound linda and paul <UNK> meet another couple called the <UNK> who they get on very well with they get on so well that they go on holiday together make up your own mind if there's some wife <UNK> going on and paul sees his wife kill the <UNK> after that the plot takes a shock twist br br writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i won't say anything to put you off the premise it's just that when the story continues after the events i've described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul <UNK> doing a very wooden voice over that <UNK> while most of the scenes exterior and interior look like they've been filmed on a <UNK> day
<START> first off i just want to say that this show could've done well way better than it's doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda <UNK> who acts as the main character <UNK> looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but she's incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if she's not sure how the character <UNK> would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her <UNK> up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the <UNK> and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and <UNK> voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that's nick they're practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is the worst of them all
<START> talk about your classics ernie the from here on out came up with a cute and creative trailer totally <UNK> star wars this gem is so <UNK> packed with <UNK> and gags i laugh every time not only that when star wars did a re issue with new special effects <UNK> wars did the same talk about a spoof that just won't die there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody he was so impressed he even hired the to work on return of the jedi don't believe me check his entry in imdb br br this has to be the first and in my opinion the best parody ever done i think the special edition was a bit overdone but on reflection i think it's perfect for the modern day re release of star wars and goes to prove that sometimes it's wrong to mess with perfection br br yes it's only 10 minutes but it's well worth your time br br you'll laugh you'll cry you'll kiss 3 goodbye well maybe 15 for the dvd but you'll be real happy you did
<START> tourist trap 1979 is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old <UNK> museum br br the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man or is it his collection of creepy <UNK> who seem to be alive and hungry for blood this film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actors actresses <UNK> roberts was very sexy and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers definitely recommended to horror movie ghost story fans i give this film a highly respectable 7 2 out of 10
<START> okay sure this film will never win an oscar citizen <UNK> this film is not but why does every film have to be <UNK> when was the last time you saw a film that was funny not <UNK> it was good but because it was goofy doesn't anyone remember roger corman king of exploitation br br well i had fun i liked the cheese just go in not expecting to think and prepare to throw popcorn at the screen
<START> <UNK> was an outstanding series its what <UNK> blue will never be on <UNK> the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with <UNK> back as a movie <UNK> up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up wont say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide life on the streets network drama at its best 5 stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get
<START> for those that are great fans and <UNK> of dinosaurs like i am it is not only a very informative series but also puts our imagination to fly colors composition great models and camera angles fantastic photography and filming presentation superb thanks
<START> this being my first john carpenter film i must say i was very impressed by the thing right from the beginning the film draws you in and never lets up on the tension the film's special effects and models hold up well even today other than kurt russell i wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in <UNK> fear paranoia and the desperation to survive the universal dvd has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras strongly recommended 9 10

<START> bit of a <UNK> egg this one i started off hating it with it's old dark <UNK> set up it's constant references to recent us horrors and regular <UNK> up and down <UNK> lit corridors br br but it does get going and has it's moments of originality br br i began to wonder once the killing started how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective br br naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie it just does not jump up and grab one hard enough
<START> yeah i read david lee <UNK> autobiography crazy from the heat which by the way is an amazing read and says this was his favorite <UNK> movie as a kid in fact he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in southern cal mr roth is <UNK> as saying br br we saw every <UNK> picture and those movies were a huge influence on me trouble man <UNK> <UNK> brown <UNK> <UNK> jones <UNK> <UNK> ray moore <UNK> his <UNK> vibe i saw all of those br br he goes on to say br br <UNK> <UNK> ray moore was one of the originals he was a blue comic doing blue humor like <UNK> foxx did on early party records so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent his answer was not bonds james bond his answer was <UNK> <UNK> we would wait for that line in all of his movies get <UNK> would show up in every single movie at least once and we would wait for that too they had the cars they had the shoes they had the guns the <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> and we all knew that all those <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the movie were white bull he's trying to feed hungry children but he's actually a <UNK> bull that was designed to make it <UNK> to our <UNK> and <UNK> so they'd let us go see the picture br br spoken like a true genius so upon reading about <UNK> in mr <UNK> book i immediately bought in on dvd and i really like it yeah it's super low budget and yeah i hate rap but as a fan of tarantino movies i can see many similarities especially some of the 70's <UNK> <UNK> ala <UNK> music throughout the film i also love the scene where the two cops him for coke and then one of them <UNK> a whole bunch of it like he'd done it a thousand times before and says something like <UNK> yeah that's the real mccoy and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip classic some of the violence is a little over the edge but shocking which i would consider to be a positive quality not as predictable as i assumed it would be definitely going to pick up the human <UNK> very soon 10 out of 10
<START> c h o m p s is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s disney family <UNK> the cat from outer space or <UNK> flying oddball for instance utterly devoid of anything creative beating the same cliches to death yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way the actors won't win any awards nor will the director writer or fx crew but in its <UNK> <UNK> and bland there is some vague entertainment to be had the idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a <UNK> the incredibly <UNK> disco soundtrack will stick in your head so beware
<START> in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously the movie is called it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget so what does one expect hitchcock br br i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the movie the oscar comes to mind most of <UNK> <UNK> movies the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a <UNK> idiot the actor who played the old man was actually very good the man who played <UNK> <UNK> professor was no <UNK> <UNK> but he did a god job and the for lack of a better were played by two competent actors i laughed at the 50 <UNK> special effects but that was part of the charm of the movie it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the 50's a meteor or radiation stir up the <UNK> and before you know it we have giant ants <UNK> rocks or <UNK> <UNK> the locals a meteor was the cause of the problems this time i was was very entertained i didn't expect much and i go a lot more then i <UNK> for
<START> both <UNK> 1 and <UNK> 2 <UNK> but the first was better the special effects in this movie were not special at all even though the killings were better in this installment they were not anything to <UNK> about one thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters they changed emotions suddenly and some of their lines were just dumb for instance one character <UNK> you better have some r e s p e c t or you'll find out what is means to me once i heard that line i figured it was of the worst i've ever heard another thing that i hated about this movie was the fact it was too short a successful movie has to go more than one hour and twenty minutes like <UNK> 2 if full moon makes part 3 of <UNK> that would be <UNK> to the lowest level they can possibly go overall 1 of 10 br br
<START> if your looking for a movie with fantastic music nice cast and a storyline that is not to difficult to understand fame is for you br br i have several scenes that i love in this movie some make you laugh others make you <UNK> the editing i think is wonderful really fast and often funny <UNK> maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing all the story's stay somehow on the surface maybe a bit too many characters are involved but i don't care because the real stars are br br the musical scenes one of my favorites the hot lunch jam sequence that piece is just so raw funky and filmed in a special way style in music hell breaking loose its just <UNK> i miss this raw energy in todays music clips the only similar energy i found perhaps in bette the rose all of the concert footage its about capturing something wild that is <UNK> happening and not doing it just perfect take by take br br so fame is a wonderful nostalgia trip to when <UNK> where heavy and walk mans not available i recommend it once a year sure not for everyone
<START> adapting his own novel <UNK> for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of <UNK> horror and fantasy craig <UNK> plays <UNK> a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a <UNK> for monsters that have been <UNK> by society when they lay claim to <UNK> and make him one of their own this causes <UNK> for everybody including <UNK> sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david <UNK> br br displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often for one thing ralph <UNK> an old hand at <UNK> art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding <UNK> and <UNK> not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions br br great supporting performances add to the fun <UNK> <UNK> lots of <UNK> intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles <UNK> is a fine love to hate him type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug <UNK> <UNK> once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as as is catherine <UNK> as rachel as an added bonus she <UNK> her breasts in one sequence simon who played the in the first two <UNK> pictures turns up here as well there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci fi star john <UNK> br br danny <UNK> supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us <UNK> through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown br br is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it i give it a <UNK> recommendation br br 9 10
<START> during my teens or should i say prime time i was eating up all kinds of sf novels every day of the week it was in the sixties and seventies when tv was not such a important <UNK> time killer like today one night in the mid seventies i watched the movie on tv i think it was and i was stunned i was impressed in a way that i can almost remember each scene even today br br nowadays i observe my kids playing the <UNK> or something like that and i think we are close to what that movie expressed i also would highly appreciate if i could buy this movie on a dvd but in vain i tried almost everything to get a hint where the movie matrix cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie and by the way by now we do not have a <UNK> if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple <UNK> models probably after our death we definitely will know
<START> years ago i read the book 'a the machine as i re read this little book again and again i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the <UNK> of the brazilian culture br br when i knew about the movie i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books well happily my fears were <UNK> and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art br br i can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text also i can't recall such a powerful performance like br br you can see and feel how <UNK> his love for is you can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love br br do see this movie watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you <UNK> yourself
<START> one wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like albert t fitzgerald who we first meet on a plane as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy when we first see him he has caught a <UNK> in the paper the woman in front of him is reading rather <UNK> he asks her if he could have the newspaper and the lady offers other sections well that's not what he asked what he wants the woman to do is to give him the front section she is reading br br matthew ryan wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects in many ways our society as it is today in fact mr is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it br br the film presents <UNK> a teen <UNK> who can't even <UNK> between fantasy and reality it's evident that killing a human being even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn't done anything to deserve it will have fatal consequences not only for himself but for his own family and the family of the <UNK> boy in fact <UNK> seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any <UNK> about it br br it's obvious <UNK> has been traumatized by his parents divorce his own father is an <UNK> man who couldn't care less about him it's pearl the teacher in the juvenile <UNK> center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help but unfortunately he doesn't have a chance br br the best thing in the film is don cheadle a great actor who always delivers the ensemble cast does good work under mr direction kevin spacey has a good opportunity playing the <UNK> father of the accused murderer and makes us <UNK> him for being an arrogant idiot br br although a bit long the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered
<START> this is in short the tv comedy series with the best cast ever and the most likable also each one of them is a comedy actor i know only one tv series which was better i e <UNK> one had willis as a it had willis only while the king of queens has a <UNK> of actors that are as fine as one can enjoy kevin james <UNK> jerry stiller <UNK> nicole sullivan victor williams gary valentine and even all the rest of them  i <UNK> and continually and promptly liked it <UNK> age didn't spoil the fun anyway br br in a few words the series is intelligent and original miraculously <UNK> of the current tv stupidity and garbage it is politically incorrect and doesn't court the <UNK> in the usual disgusting way br br the comic is very <UNK> and <UNK> br br i read mostly a few imdb writers and sometimes they write about their favorite though these writers are several i did not encountered at any of them the slightest mention of my favorite tv shows but it's true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete those who at least offer a common basis for <UNK> are mainly wild wild west <UNK> queens the '80s twilight zone <UNK> tv show and most of them i have seen when i was <UNK> about a few of them i have written and <UNK>
<START> somehow lost out in the <UNK> awards to my brother jack the latter a high quality adaptation of george <UNK> immortal novel was outstanding but in my opinion not as good as i have heard that many critics <UNK> as being irrelevant <UNK> historically inaccurate or even <UNK> who and where are these critics is outstanding more than that brilliant it's not supposed to be a documentary certainly i can forgive the actual survivors or indeed any survivors of a <UNK> camp for being disappointed with the production but to the rest of us represents the remarkable power of in times of extreme <UNK> it contains a part of the australian culture that appears to be <UNK> as times become easier and less challenging but which we should never forget <UNK> were respected worldwide after <UNK> and ww2 for their <UNK> and sense of humour rating <UNK> 100 see also <UNK> paradise road the last bullet the sugar factory
<START> he who fights with monsters might take care <UNK> he thereby become a monster and if you <UNK> for long into an <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> also into you br br yes this is from <UNK> <UNK> from beyond good and evil and that's what you find at the start of this movie br br if you watch the whole movie you will doubt if it was the message that the ram <UNK> <UNK> production wanted to pass on as the scenes crop up one by one quite violent and at times <UNK> <UNK> the viewer is expected to forget the <UNK> quote and think otherwise that to deal with few people you need dedicated people like who will have the <UNK> to kill anyone not just writing something <UNK> of the police to do as we are made to believe br br when was and the government wanted to pass newer and even more <UNK> laws <UNK> <UNK> did the required brain surgery without blood <UNK> for the <UNK> growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a <UNK> country like india within a year was passed br br when real life encounter <UNK> a monster on the path of fighting <UNK> and was himself <UNK> by <UNK> was made to <UNK> out false impression among the people about this with it's you have to be a monster to save your nation approach br br and people consumed it no questions raised only <UNK> and hopes that they get a in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and <UNK> flow all over blood you can ignore br br every time israel attacks <UNK> or <UNK> we hear voices like india must also similarly attack <UNK> this movie is made for such <UNK> if you don't give them this they will probably die out of boredom and <UNK> and what not br br hence this game of the passion of hatred
<START> although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget that's not what i go to movies for there wasn't one character i found sympathetic they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers everything they attempt ends badly it's all too hopeless for me reviews refer to the <UNK> chair as a black comedy comedy the brother <UNK> behaves like an <UNK> from an institution when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother he almost hints at <UNK> not playing with a full deck nonetheless josh performs a wedding for <UNK> and a woman <UNK> met just a few hours before there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film and i saw it at a free screening
<START> the topics presented are very interesting suburban culture suburban <UNK> public <UNK> oil gas <UNK> energy <UNK> alternative energy sources etc br br the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece one viewpoint is presented then <UNK> upon the viewer over and over you see the same handful of repeatedly making their case the supposed starts off sounding like a news reporter but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma br br the dark side of the film is not so much the <UNK> and doom message about oil <UNK> but the sense that the folks in the film are actually <UNK> for a post oil society and all that it <UNK> they paint this picture of a <UNK> society where we all return to the self contained local village model walk to work shop <UNK> grow our own food and generally live an <UNK> 19th century lifestyle for them the post oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world it would certainly spell the end of <UNK> and better still the end of <UNK> i will give them some credit for <UNK> actual <UNK> in exposing the weaknesses of several over <UNK> alternative energy sources including and <UNK> br br i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise
<START> i wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european <UNK> and the united nations what a load of right wing <UNK> incidentally the bit about canada joining the us didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character <UNK> to run for president but they could have just made him american and <UNK> with that in any event this was a load of bull and not worth your time if you <UNK> to see this kind of thing done well check out the brilliant bbc political thriller state of play
<START> i recall years back michael douglas wanted his wife catherine zeta jones to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods no doubt she does but not in this film a <UNK> waste of time no story no character development no chemistry <UNK> this was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be boring and a huge disappointment didn't even watch the whole film torture catherine zeta jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen move around present a dish but this wasn't the food network nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared supposedly a romantic interest <UNK> where was the chemistry the poor <UNK> on the second floor of her building trying all the <UNK> to connect and no character development there the loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a <UNK> the sister's daughter just was <UNK> here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in not just a waste of movie time the <UNK> certainly did their job to put this lack <UNK> film on all the networks <UNK> you with all kinds of <UNK> sorry to say don't spend a dime
<START> curse of monkey island is a treasure in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure <UNK> not to mention br br but to return to curse whats beautiful about is that its not afraid to be itself it does <UNK> from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series the voice work is impeccable with dominic playing our favorite protagonist the animation while quite different than the classic <UNK> characters is done beautifully it really is just absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off br br although i'm not too big a fan of romance the romantic scenes and themes are not at all <UNK> they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy that says a lot from a girl who <UNK> falls asleep during chick flicks br br then of course is the classic <UNK> element of humor is quite <UNK> at delivering deadpan lines altogether <UNK> humor and simply good fun gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young <UNK> and world events are <UNK> <UNK> at without stepping out of the <UNK> of the game br br its not entirely fair to compare to <UNK> and because it truly is in a realm of its own personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other however if you want a <UNK> good time with the flair of the classic series i insist you give this game a shot you will not be disappointed br br 10 10 stars hands down br br emily n
<START> may contain spoilers this movie is the epitome of weirdness i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny however i still honestly can't decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isn't for instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music when we go to we have up beat quasi mr <UNK> neighborhood music however when the little kid's dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense so watch this film and decide for yourself it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say kudos br br nose dive wow
<START> just above the box i am <UNK> in now i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature film unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero and i have to put something if i had my choice i would just put nothing no number because there exist no <UNK> that express the <UNK> of this movie br br if you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film br br i don't know how this film was released to the public it should be locked up and <UNK> 24 7 somewhere in <UNK> knox i am angry that this film was even available for me to watch i feel cheated by humanity i had no idea humans could be this cruel <UNK> <UNK> and hitler got nothing on this <UNK> bag br br do not be fooled by the movie's cover 1 there are no scarecrows no one knows why there is a <UNK> looking scarecrow on the front 2 none of the characters on the back of case are even in the <UNK> movie 3 the tag line says something about new moon more victims there were no <UNK> victims no one even died we don't know if the <UNK> cop died and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a <UNK> ball bat br br do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie it wasted about 4 hours of my life that's right four it took an hour for me to watch it i fast <UNK> thru the 4 minute <UNK> scenes that reveal nothing in the plot i <UNK> at the television for about an hour after it was over <UNK> my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it
<START> the <UNK> movie i've ever seen not scary just bad 1st movie made by the wwe and trust me the only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans it has terrible acting and the worst directing i've seen yet i found myself laughing at the storyline and bad actors i saw that the wwe people tried really hard to put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills and several camera effects i think they copied a lot from silent hill this movie's not engaging either so if you do see it you're gonna find yourself <UNK> out because of it's lack of suspense the <UNK> the worst no matter what you'll come out wanting your money back
<START> driving lessons sees two middle class quintessential british families meet head on when character comes into contact with <UNK> a slightly deranged out of touch actress with an ego betrays his <UNK> and over christian mother <UNK> and goes off travelling with to scotland to <UNK> her on a trip to participate in a poetry reading something she claims could be her last due to an illness br br portrayal of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by an overbearing and even <UNK> mother is the masterpiece of this film his portrayal of a <UNK> teen in search of his true morals and happiness is captivating to watch unfold throughout the film is <UNK> shot and well paced with very few moments leaving you tired an achievement particularly considering the nature of the plot <UNK> really grabs hold of her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things <UNK> <UNK> ironic <UNK> throughout her role in driving lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sense br br the plot develops nicely leaving the audience cheering on as he chases back to place during his lunch break during his <UNK> at a local <UNK> to <UNK> for his <UNK> the values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag in a very consistent way the overbearing and <UNK> main idea being that religion doesn't lead to happiness and certainly doesn't lead to morality br br the audience are left <UNK> with the radical but lovable with her and making an irresistible <UNK> on the big screen transferred directly from their debut in the harry potter series charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must see this christmas
<START> <UNK> comes back to home after <UNK> her college she has got a nice charisma which always drawn men to her a dare devil navy employee is one such guy he loves her deeply and even engaged to marry her <UNK> is another person who is insane and he also loves br br is very close to her family and is <UNK> by everyone in his home <UNK> has never met <UNK> but then <UNK> would kill anyone who comes between him and <UNK> so when <UNK> comes to know that <UNK> is in love with what will he do will he kill him or he himself will be <UNK> for his devil acts
<START> this is a good time to say how good i think of this site it gives me the opportunity to <UNK> all the frustration i lived for two hours awaiting for something to happens for something to be said to be shown to be <UNK> subtly for a symbol an idea whatever no just long endless <UNK> <UNK> by a tired piano tired voices tired actors and bored characters and situations boring is the long death of the mind and this movie is from that point of view a public enemy how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent <UNK> i don't claim for my money back just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing oh god
<START> what a bad movie <UNK> is perhaps the very worst movie i've seen all year and i've run across some <UNK> there is nothing redeeming about this trash from the characterization to the direction to the plot even the usually brilliant <UNK> <UNK> couldn't save this movie none of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic with the possible exception of <UNK> wonderfully portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> the only bright spot in this dismal failure br br possible spoilers br br the main problem with <UNK> is that it <UNK> on without saying anything it <UNK> about <UNK> instead of leading us along the path of the story it also introduces numerous potentially <UNK> details the <UNK> brother the mother's <UNK> constantly being <UNK> the anti <UNK> <UNK> the other <UNK> murderous father without successfully exploring a single one of them and just when i finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end br br i left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be <UNK> this is an obvious first film from a writer director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before <UNK> any more of her work on an unsuspecting public br br i gave this film 1 out of 10 and i'm usually very generous even with bad films
<START> this film sucks a big one so many holes in the plot if the devil is <UNK> why does he require the protection of <UNK> <UNK> i couldn't <UNK> why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears takes their entire <UNK> and disappears again nice work if you can get it it's sad that the last 1 2 hour has to result in the standard arnie finale <UNK> interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and <UNK> i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film dreadfully scripted arnie is called etc for 95 of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of <UNK> <UNK> where do they get these names from the ending is so <UNK> you'd better get the <UNK> bag ready shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100 more class br br
<START> johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual <UNK> billy graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet sometimes corny but all the way sincere flick he gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good solid advice that holds true today about morals decisions the generation gap teen dating some of the <UNK> that are given in this movie are astounding they sound like today's <UNK> just to see billy in his younger days is worth seeing it's an awesome movie it made me realize that human nature does not change even though hair fashion and language may change humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years
<START> when deranged was made the film makers saw fit to turn ed <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> even though the <UNK> film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case i presume that enough was <UNK> that they thought they should change names and such br br ed <UNK> the butcher of <UNK> as a true story retelling of the <UNK> case but actually bears very little resemblance to the history as a biopic type film it is a travesty if ever a film needed names changing it is this one far more so than deranged it is as close to the true crime story as dirty harry was to the true story of the zodiac killings br br ok so that annoyance aside how is it as a horror film well as a horror film well as a film generally it is quite appalling one of the worst films i have sat through in months issues run thus 1 kane <UNK> is quite astonishingly miscast as ed <UNK> utterly <UNK> in the part <UNK> just <UNK> through <UNK> very bad br br 2 kane <UNK> is the best actor in the film the rest of the cast are rather amateur <UNK> and utterly <UNK> it is painful to witness some lines being delivered br br 3 the occasional efforts of stylish film making seem to come from the big book of moody cinematography cliché you've seen it all before better executed aside from the efforts at style the rest of the film making is largely inept cameras shake framing is bad there are overlong pointless shots holding back the pace which leads me to br br 4 it seems to go on forever it is under 90 minutes in length but sitting through it is an ordeal you'd swear it ran two and a half hours br br 5 ed <UNK> almost seems secondary mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff said deputy is played by an abysmal actor upon whose shoulders no film should rest br br is anything good about it well the gore fx are very good some convincing wounds are in display and the make up is generally excellent none of this however makes up for the massive <UNK> of the film br br it doesn't even have any <UNK> value it's just bad not <UNK> bad not so bad it's good just genuinely bad a film to avoid and despise
<START> this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever and i certainly won't argue with that even in a country where top notch animated shorts are created with <UNK> this film still manages to stand out if you ever get the chance to view this film please do so it's only ten minutes long and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with <UNK> a woman who <UNK> the <UNK> and a nuclear war what more could you want in a film
<START> there's a brand new killer on the loose and he's doing god's work yeah right this killer makes jason look like a <UNK> and freddy krueger look like a <UNK> doll against this dude he is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kane <UNK> a monster who <UNK> a axe and a hook and chain those weapons are nothing to him his real <UNK> is ripping out <UNK> from the victims <UNK> that is totally <UNK> when the encounter happened 4 years earlier <UNK> killed a rookie cop and <UNK> the veteran after putting a bullet in his head how on earth did <UNK> survive after 4 years now he's in the condemned hotel called <UNK> and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting i liked the part where <UNK> checked out one of the girl's <UNK> on her back and <UNK> himself is really deranged thanks to his <UNK> mother if you think friday the 13th was something you better think again this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat and i think the <UNK> rip was bone chilling this movie proves it point and it wasn't a waste of my time i enjoyed it the title don't lie rating 2 5 out of 5 stars
<START> um hello <UNK> the name alone is hard to take it seriously like she could be the cousin of <UNK> <UNK> but when you're a kid this is definitely serious stuff br br so there's this vile <UNK> spoiled girl and she wants <UNK> belt amongst other things ie the light of the whole universe and <UNK> and her friend <UNK> are bound and determined to stop her as i remember murky and had a minor role in this production maybe they wanted too much money br br so anyway <UNK> evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take belt imagine but somehow <UNK> gets her belt back and re it with star <UNK> and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> and they also save the whole universe in the process br br so good <UNK> over evil <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> and <UNK> and the color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind
<START> i've had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film but this is probably the first <UNK> is the worst i've seen from this director br br <UNK> films is advertising this as the most frightening film yet from <UNK> kurosawa what the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely <UNK> and if you think this is horror your in for a surprise this can't be classified as horror or thriller this is a drama and a pretty bad one at that a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny and a lot of the plot is really confusing and since it's kurosawa the pacing is slow but it's so slow that you'll lose interest forty minutes in and feel like doing something else the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi now cgi if used well can be really cool but if executed with little care it can be a disaster i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgi br br the only positive thing i can give is that it has really good acting <UNK> <UNK> gives a great performance along with the rest of the cast but that's pretty much it br br please do yourself a favor and go watch <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> if you want to be scared this is a bad bad attempt at a smart drama which it is intelligent but well there's a lot missing br br 3 10 for the good acting
<START> just <UNK> was i must say one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies my expectations weren't high to begin with but it turned out to be <UNK> than i expected i thought it might not be all that bad when it started but as soon as the name of the competition the golden <UNK> came up i began changing my mind it all went downhill from there the only thing i did like about this movie other than <UNK> at it's absurd plot and dialogue was watching them cook however being a movie about <UNK> <UNK> there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie you get to see more food being prepared and you dodge the pathetic one liners however if you enjoy corny love stories which is sometimes fun go ahead and watch
<START> having never actually seen anything by this beloved of the let alone a production of <UNK> of <UNK> i cant comment on how faithful it is to previous adaptations of the play so i will treat it as just another movie that tries to be more than <UNK> for the eye is an instantly gripping movie about a young lover <UNK> and his <UNK> friend antonio <UNK> and a jewish money <UNK> <UNK> pacino br br plot summary br br is broke and needs money to woo the lovely collins he goes to his friend antonio who with his friends <UNK> so borrows some money off <UNK> br br now antonio does not like jews in general and <UNK> in particular and <UNK> bitter and twisted from the abuse he has suffered from antonio in particular and christians in general agrees to lend antonio the money on condition that if antonio does not <UNK> the <UNK> by the agreed <UNK> <UNK> will cut a pound of flesh from body br br comment br br the movie is <UNK> beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way as to force you to think about what each line means this in turn causes the viewer to gain insights into the characters and their motivations br br it seems to me to be a movie about the choices that <UNK> makes and how making wrong choices leads to ruin br br from the moment <UNK> demands his pound of flesh he is doomed for rest of the world is against him and to bring about his downfall br br this disturbed me greatly normally in a movie when a victim gets a chance of revenge against those who have <UNK> him either the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error of his ways leading to a big hug br br not in the victim quickly becomes seen as the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith br br this movie is a powerful and subtle portrayal of casual anti <UNK> which shows how a whole society can turn on a minority and make it seem like the victim is really the <UNK> br br i was blown away by this movie 10 10
<START> the acting was flat at least none of the actors sounded like they'd just got the script that morning and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to <UNK> testing but for me being eastern <UNK> the most <UNK> thing about this film was the total of the religion romania is <UNK> <UNK> but you'd never know that from this movie father <UNK> is irish and i'd have known this even if i hadn't seen the actor play the irish pub keep michael sullivan in star trek <UNK> episodes the bishop was wearing roman and for the record not even <UNK> <UNK> wear their unless they're saying the especially if they live in a monastery about the only non <UNK> i saw was the 3 bar cross on the door of the church and even then i had to <UNK> to see it the first reviewer said the producers had done their research well if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film
<START> i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film
<START> okay first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget with that in mind it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher but still br br after giving it a chance it still <UNK> some basic film making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me <UNK> a lot br br think blair witch in a car but really boring br br think you left your camcorder on the <UNK> and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour then making your friends watch it br br the scariest part possible spoiler alert if spoiling here is possible was at one point the picture <UNK> and you might think you will have to watch it all over again scary br br silliness aside this is a pretty good idea for a low budget lets go make a movie tonight film but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad and let's just say it wasn't really good there were just too many parts where nothing happened at first i thought that was the director's plan you were supposed to be <UNK> into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening but no br br i kept trying to find good things to say about it and i had plenty of time to think and i'll say the music was kinda cool and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really really long time but that's it the actors playing infected people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from <UNK> chances are if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie it's on dvd or <UNK> so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult br br i hate to be so critical of something but at the same time i've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff it might be decent maybe that'll be the director's cut
<START> direct to video is a phrase that never sounds promising to the <UNK> unless its a direct to video sequel to something that went direct to video in the first place despite this studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct to video sequels over the years to cult hits i don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time including the <UNK> ii starship troopers 2 and cruel intentions 3 it's fitting that road house 2 was <UNK> by scott as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick and <UNK> them with no success whatsoever this is no sequel this is a remake all the way various lines from the original are repeated plot points cut and <UNK> and scenes are <UNK> almost shot for shot from the first one the one thing that could not be <UNK> were the amazing fight scenes which made road house what it was here we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour compare that with its <UNK> fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs the spider but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess it's not completely his fault as the screenplay is very very poorly written and clunky i don't care if something goes direct to video a good script is still required someone should keep that mind while continuously <UNK> these low budget direct to dvd movies out skip it entirely 1 10
<START> what starts out as a passable movie <UNK> into one of the most incoherent <UNK> <UNK> made stupid attempted horror films of recent years br br absolutely terrible it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare whether it's <UNK> the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of <UNK> gates of hell br br the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a <UNK> to make you jump to be avoided
<START> well i set out with a few friends to see this movie we went an hour before the show started to get good seats so as you can probably imagine we where <UNK> to see this movie but that excitement soon turned to horror this movie is a complete failure it just <UNK> to hard to be funny that its sad the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it br br the only good acting in the whole movie was from <UNK> c <UNK> who was great the plot was weak and even the funny scenes felt forced and unnatural considering that the main actors are some of best comedians it's well special br br i would not recommend this movie to any one because it <UNK> to hard and never really delivers
<START> many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isn't realistic how can it not be considered realistic they feel that say the incest part isn't easy to relate to that it isn't common i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur many of them aren't going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims also many people are gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be <UNK> and possibly even abandoned and tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder i bet a lot and although <UNK> isn't from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to who can't relate to being an <UNK> or being <UNK> that happens all the time and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus being a <UNK> seems to be quite common these days to so there are a lot of things to relate to more than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware it comes from the people that don't show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds br br the ending surprised me i wasn't expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7 my only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick until i thought more it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what <UNK> are like plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other br br though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film
<START> somehow somewhere <UNK> you gotta see this film breath taking and incredible outstanding performances from highly gifted actors you think du <UNK> blows your mind wait till you see what these 2 women do most importantly the emotional journey and struggles jane <UNK> faces are universal in theme to many women a superbly directed film which deals with the <UNK> of relationships and holding on until you're ready to let go this masterpiece will touch women and men alike ned far director writer and ridiculously talented <UNK> star producer just had the guts to tell it honestly and sincerely this film will hit big see it however you can or you won't be in the loop when it becomes one of the most talked about films
<START> this is a hard movie to come by in the us but if you can find it and you're interested in the life and music of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you're in for a treat it's quite historically accurate richard <UNK> looks <UNK> like <UNK> at this period in time emily karen is quite a bit <UNK> than the real karen but that was an <UNK> i was happy to discover i think what really struck me though was how well captured outrageous personality barbara <UNK> rose was also a treasure if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period it is more than made up for in how well she captured <UNK> obsession with <UNK> it's an easy film to recommend i should note that when she saw passion my wife had no particular <UNK> for or knowledge of <UNK> and his music but she was totally captivated by the film
<START> as a rule i try to find as much in films as i possibly can to enjoy them i made no exceptions with <UNK> doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was but no effort no matter how great could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie br br it failed for a number of reasons firstly the cinematography was <UNK> and <UNK> secondly the script reached depths of <UNK> that took it well and truly beyond the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category <UNK> the acting left mind blowing amounts to be desired it was appalling it really was anyone who saw <UNK> barton seen here as the remarkably terrible grace a character so poorly invented and realised that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't seem so bad as <UNK> in john lawn dogs will wonder what went wrong between then and now perhaps had she been given a character worth bothering with and a <UNK> of direction she at least might have given this film one redeeming feature alas such was not the case finally the film seemed to have no point whatsoever expressing nothing achieving nothing really i wonder why christina wayne bothered br br <UNK> made a feeble attempt to be something and failed the result a film sadly so bad that it's just very very bad don't bother it really isn't worth it
<START> this is one of the <UNK> stories told by the <UNK> that isn't directly relevant to the war stopping one <UNK> plot of the films but <UNK> voiced by carrie does appear in it it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a <UNK> named <UNK> we see his search which features other <UNK> only one who he meets who has seemingly gone mad from his own experience trying to track <UNK> down eventually he makes contact with <UNK> who he assumes to be a man of course told in the narrative and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know on a <UNK> chat room and <UNK> a <UNK> which forces him in a hurry to catch a train he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of <UNK> so absurd it's hilarious br br he meets her on the train but the <UNK> is thereby revealed when agents attack the agents were using him to get to <UNK> and <UNK> was trying to free the <UNK> sent after her which he doesn't know of course and which isn't <UNK> stated in the animation itself something common to film noir titles which often hint at plenty of interesting back story subplots developments etc but don't show you more then the core story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue br br almost everything in this short is in black and white the music is reminiscent of film noir and the offbeat old fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title the trivia section of this <UNK> entry on imdb also <UNK> presents a few references this title makes to <UNK> literature something it also borrows heavily from a genre of mysteries for detectives gangsters etc who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often animated <UNK> by studio <UNK> and directed by <UNK> it is an enjoyable <UNK> on the usual matrix story
<START> this has one of the more unusual plots i've seen in a horror film but it's based on good solid universal studios fare lots of monsters pretty heroine torch bearing villagers but my favorite part is larry <UNK> the wolf man searching for the cure for his <UNK> after dying in the original wolf man he is <UNK> and wanders through frankenstein meets the wolf man and house of frankenstein searching for a way to end his <UNK> i think first time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting br br
<START> i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome because this one scores on every level br br it has an intelligent believable script it shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger and the movie also gives you a great behind the scenes look of how television is made br br it scores as a thriller the first time i saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat and it scores as a character movie i really cared for the main characters jane fonda michael douglas <UNK> <UNK> and most of all jack lemmon are great
<START> michael <UNK> the director of the <UNK> of <UNK> makes a tremendous job in opening the play as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this <UNK> account of a horrible time in history the <UNK> production of the shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the <UNK> of the <UNK> century br br this is a story of revenge prejudice and justice as imagined by william shakespeare having seen the play a few times we were not prepared about what to expect mr <UNK> takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone also he has used a version of english that makes more sense rather than relying on the original text in fact the way <UNK> speaks in the film doesn't shock at all being he a member of a minority that has been <UNK> by the <UNK> authorities and the catholic church br br al pacino tremendous portrayal of <UNK> shows a man that is vulnerable arrogant mean and totally human all at the same time mr pacino <UNK> light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a <UNK> his own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be <UNK> in on him at the end of the film we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and <UNK> by everyone br br <UNK> collins as is a happy discovery having seen her in lighter fare she not only surprises but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera she shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend who <UNK> his own well being in trying to help get hand br br jeremy <UNK> plays antonio the man who seeks <UNK> for a bridge <UNK> after all he knows his ships will be returning with <UNK> from abroad soon antonio gets much more than he <UNK> for in <UNK> with <UNK> to the terms of the <UNK> <UNK> best laid plans go <UNK> when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his <UNK> mr <UNK> gives a subtle performance br br joseph <UNK> makes a good appearance as his good looks and his charm make an impression on who clearly sees a soul mate in this young <UNK> as she knows he is the one for her also in smaller roles kris marshall robinson charlie cox contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience br br ultimately it's mr triumph because of the vision he gives us of <UNK> and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind
<START> this film is so bad it's hilarious i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy although i couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p ss or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent i notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious it's basically seems to be about a gang of who ride round on <UNK> shooting at each other and <UNK> the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine one scene inexplicably has two characters <UNK> <UNK> over each others heads then showing each other <UNK> out of jail cards that they've made also check out <UNK> jones' accent where the hell is he meant to be from oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too who for some <UNK> reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these skinned b the guy who wrote and directed it a pee wee herman <UNK> with a beard and an orange <UNK> has for some reason cast himself in the lead role maybe this is part of the joke i don't know actually the more i think about it the more i'm sure this film is a p ss take it's produced by quentin tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh it is a total rip off of <UNK> style but just done really really badly it is very amusing though and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino rodriguez style or something that is very very unintentionally funny has to be seen to be believed
<START> i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about <UNK> this film was not it it was rather long drawn out dull and <UNK> too much time was spent exploring relationship with and not enough time was spent on his relationship with sally <UNK> the lady who played sally <UNK> <UNK> was absolutely awful her acting was so bad it was like watching an <UNK> <UNK> trying to <UNK> shakespeare her constant whining voice <UNK> the nerves <UNK> accent made <UNK> sound like an ignorant man rather than a genius relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped yet his <UNK> daughter's rebellion <UNK> is a key event late in the film the film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement on the positive side the costumes were quite beautiful and greta <UNK> played the part of well if you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and or <UNK> then watch it's much better than <UNK> in paris
<START> a fantastic movie and very overlooked gary has never been more handsome and ingrid is more beautiful than in any other film if you don't believe just watch the movie every cast member is wonderful the love scenes between gary and ingrid will make your pulse race the story is great the script is oscar caliber don't miss this film
<START> well since it's called porno holocaust and directed by joe <UNK> i went into this film expecting sleaze and while i somewhat got it porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as it's just so damned boring the title suggests that the film will feature porn and that's not wrong porno holocaust is pretty much just porn and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again i was fast <UNK> before the end the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up but after that it just <UNK> into normal porn and the rest of the film for the first hour is made up of talking and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through the plot focuses on a deserted island where believe it or not something strange is going on naturally it's not long before a group of people made up of a few men and some scientists who all happen to be sexy women land on the island they have sex a few times and some strange things happen then over an hour later they're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies br br this must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno a zombie who likes to get it on but <UNK> it doesn't work well at all the film <UNK> in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark and that is far too long for a film like this i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is if they'd just <UNK> one minute out of every sex scene the film would have been under ninety minutes and that would have made it much more tolerable the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear it's quite a long time before there's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place and when it does finally appear it's a huge disappointment i realise that this is low budget b movie trash but <UNK> surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this i'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting atmosphere etc there's no point porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight <UNK> of horror and i can't recommend it
<START> this episode has just aired in the uk br br what a disappointment the heavy handed touches of humour were ill judged childish and <UNK> from what could have been a pretty good storyline i cannot believe that jerry bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place i have seen every previous episode of this show and even the episode where jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode the lesbian kiss was pathetic <UNK> br br there was also no continuity from the previous episode there was nothing in the storyline investigating <UNK> dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction there was similarly nothing <UNK> written about jack's <UNK> relationship with ann usually without a trace is pretty good at this sort of continuity br br the next episode needs to be a considerable improvement
<START> critics are a strange kind of people some of them are common people like you and me some of them are not when a critic say cruelty is beautiful i wonder where they did grow up what's beautiful with filming a field some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and capture the mood of the <UNK> for sure can't i've seen kids do better footage than manage to do in cruelty but that's not the worst part the worst part is the whole recording i refuse to call this a film is just a bad excuse to picture nudity and extreme torture rapes of both <UNK> masturbation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> child murder and much much more i love gore splatter and i love horror this ain't neither of those this is utter crap and if my comments make just one single person skip cruelty it's been worth it always remember that your life won't last forever don't waste two hours of precious time on cruelty you've been warned
<START> this television show is stereotypical and far fetched in many of its aspects br br first of all the setting all of the characters attend this unbelievable <UNK> school with painted stylish <UNK> the campus seems to have no reasonable rules for instance the boys are often seen in the girls' <UNK> and vice versa but this may be simply because the <UNK> <UNK> a silly character that basically <UNK> the viewer instead of amusing them as i assume her purpose is supposed to be sits around and does nothing i have friends in <UNK> schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show br br next the characters i was so disappointed to discover that <UNK> wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme <UNK> is supposedly perfect in everything she does looks <UNK> sports guys judgment creativity etc michael is the jock logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from <UNK> all the characters as well as us poor viewers nicole is the <UNK> idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight <UNK> dana was the tough girl quinn is the unrealistic <UNK> kid ' whom they consistently make fun of chase is the guy who is afraid of <UNK> his <UNK> which really <UNK> me as the show continues and that new girl lola or something is just another clone of nicole br br the main two characters that <UNK> me the most are <UNK> and quinn first of all i just do not understand character she was obviously created to be the <UNK> character as i said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them in most of the episodes she creates a problem then has to fix it what's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with br br quinn on the other hand bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting the impression i get from nick concerning her character is that <UNK> and are people to laugh at to criticize to mock in the spring break episode they did a year ago they introduced two more who the characters had to make <UNK> ' i found this highly offensive and stereotypical what kind of message is nick sending to these kids is it don't do well in school don't get good <UNK> don't study hard you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series because that is definitely the message i get from these poorly constructed characters and it is an awful message through and through br br all i can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world they are not doing anyone any good
<START> another french film with absurdity <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> me tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f <UNK> one of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend second one is a hooker who kills her <UNK> and sees her boyfriend being shot dead after those incidents they meet at a tube station both misses the last train then the whole thing starts they find a bound and come very close they abuse men sexually take drugs drive around the country and have lots of sex thats all about <UNK> <UNK> really we can see that they have no mercy for their victims they even kill a woman for her money both actresses are real porn stars in france that affects the movie in two different ways they look so comfortable in sex scenes nonetheless they can't make the whole film worth watching as to me the film does not require no further ability of acting than that it is a version of thelma and louise on a different level i could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching <UNK> <UNK> so bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless kinky film out of
<START> i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved <UNK> so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city and of course nine months after the film comes out 7 7 happens yes the truth is stranger than fiction having lived in both countries it is also clear the <UNK> of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us muslims live in <UNK> and <UNK> themselves in the uk in the us they <UNK> much more readily
<START> this pointless film was a complete disappointment none of the characters is likeable in the least so you watch what <UNK> each without really caring what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male <UNK> was filled with <UNK> young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex
<START> delivers great acting and greater special effects stars david <UNK> one of my personal favorites as <UNK> it's special effects on the monsters were so good you thought they might be really <UNK> clive barker however demented scored a perfect 10 on my list
<START> terrible writing highly contrived from a do <UNK> who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in l a or the usa in the present day the <UNK> positive reviews are a mystery to me but could only be provided by folks who think that someone's good intentions should be <UNK> regardless of how shallow <UNK> and just totally unrealistic the results are if you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day l a race issues the movie you need to see and probably already saw is pulp fiction there's more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours oh i'm sorry it just felt like 4 hours of this stinker br br if anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is <UNK> with good intentions then this is the movie for you
<START> weak direction weak plot unimpressive music i wonder why is there in the movie world in the first place she tried to reveal a lot of her talent mostly skin but failed to impress br br music wasn't that impressive as well only one song was worth listening to br br the title well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end but it didn't make sense br br there were many <UNK> twists and turns in the story which made it more boring however if someone's a <UNK> fan please go ahead and watch it
<START> being both a <UNK> <UNK> fan and a phantom of the opera fan i was dying to see his first take on the story before the so bad it's good <UNK> <UNK> phantom of the opera the film is just terrific even the plot which here is one of <UNK> best at a coherent story the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific the film has a very nightmarish feel which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat the colors have never been better in an <UNK> film since the jaw dropping <UNK> the murders are clever and gory all done in <UNK> trademark style the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling and done some much better than in <UNK> splatter the acting is so so but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters' motivations better and you get used to it my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera <UNK> with heavy metal but it's not executed very well here the ending is very disappointing which is the worst thing about the movie seeming to echo <UNK> previous <UNK> but done terribly it just didn't need to end that way the same thing happened in the director's cut of the exorcist i wished they kept the original ending but still it's a fantastic motion picture and really a must see if only for daria memorable murder sequence
<START> the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old i thought it was bad then and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever i watched this movie on <UNK> about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place <UNK> character <UNK> is annoying and obnoxious there's no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t v soap opera i'm glad that i didn't see this movie at the theatre or rent it i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me madonna is not necessarily a bad actress but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot
<START> chris <UNK> plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young <UNK> posing as a doctor who <UNK> a community in order to push his sister's son into the position as his <UNK> genius the only man that can stop him is a cop who plays by his own rules and is forced to go undercover with the help of his mute father who <UNK> via board will rick <UNK> find out whats up or will somebody <UNK> his recording studio does the mentally retarded boy who <UNK> the book mobile have clues watch to find out i'm not making this up
<START> a low rent cheaply made police thriller that's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads and especially by james <UNK> satisfying turn as a <UNK> <UNK> and naturally <UNK> villain obviously a low quality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather <UNK> burt but not unwatchable
<START> it's a movie with a theatrical message <UNK> with some clever moments films like these are the <UNK> grounds of great actors they enjoy <UNK> the ball in open pieces like these the angel that wasn't what we see in old books and <UNK> is quite a nice change it is <UNK> in kevin smith's piece dogma almost in the same slapstick vein br br 0 watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someone's basement was <UNK> this summer and i grabbed a handful of tapes br br whether in a trash bin or on the silver screen mild comedies like this are fun you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it or a <UNK> political party just keep it for yourself and i'll bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time
<START> the last film of john huston the great american director of the irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection <UNK> of the greatest writer ever came from ireland the film is a family affair the dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son tony huston from one of the most poignant beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many the best english language short story john directed his daughter <UNK> in what could be her finest screen performance the film is short only <UNK> minutes it's got no action sequences no plot it is almost non <UNK> and it may seem slow the guests friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in <UNK> during the <UNK> week in january <UNK> at the house of two elderly sisters who give <UNK> dinner with music and dance what viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble conversation piece the guests talk listen to the music discuss the latest opera premiere and make jokes sometimes awkward gradually the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away br br this is the film you have to stay with let it pull you in listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate pay attention to the body languages to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light laugh and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive if you do you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you it will break your heart to pieces pull them together and put it back <UNK> the film as well as <UNK> story centers on gabriel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as james <UNK> alter ego gave a very moving understated performance as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife <UNK> <UNK> huston gabriel is still in love feels close connection to and fascinated with her it is after the party he discovers that even after many years of <UNK> he does not know all about her past her pains her regrets and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl and he is no part of for the first time he looks at her and thinks of her not as the <UNK> part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world her own loneliness and sadness and for the first time a strange friendly pity for her entered his soul it is he who <UNK> the final most powerful and profound lines of the story snow is general all over ireland falling <UNK> through the universe and <UNK> falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead br br if you have not seen the film or read the <UNK> story please do they are truly the works of art that leave the <UNK> impression and would change something in you to the best
<START> lloyd hamilton was one of the most imaginative and among the funniest of all the silent film comedians why is he utterly forgotten unfortunately the original <UNK> for a large <UNK> of his films were lost when the fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s hamilton was not handsome or <UNK> like chaplin keaton and lloyd nor was he <UNK> like raymond griffith and unlike harry <UNK> and again chaplin hamilton did not try for audience sympathy br br however his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release and they remain hilarious today oscar <UNK> once claimed that he asked chaplin if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever <UNK> and chaplin instantly named lloyd hamilton the character most frequently portrayed by hamilton on screen a flat <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> hand gestures and a duck like walk was later adapted by vaudeville comedian eddie <UNK> <UNK> father and further adapted by jackie <UNK> as his 1950s tv character 'the poor <UNK> br br 'the <UNK> directed by <UNK> <UNK> is one of <UNK> most innovative shorts and it's hilarious we first see him as a country boy <UNK> farewell to his family outside their <UNK> <UNK> on his way to the big city then he steps away from the <UNK> and we see that it's in the big city with traffic <UNK> all round him br br eventually our hero ends up at a restaurant uncredited but it's the <UNK> <UNK> in downtown l a where all the movie actors eat between takes there's an amusing gag when <UNK> <UNK> character meets three actors in costume and makeup as <UNK> washington lincoln and <UNK> this gag would have been funnier if the looked more like the originals finally our <UNK> seats himself at a table hoping to meet a celebrity sure enough entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star none other than lloyd hamilton there's a very well made double exposure shot the join is nearly invisible when lloyd hamilton as himself <UNK> lloyd hamilton as the country boy br br sadly <UNK> peak period of creativity was very brief he began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act ham and bud opposite bud <UNK> and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period sound movies were not kind to hamilton and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early <UNK> then he died young fortunately 'the <UNK> is quite funny and a splendid introduction to this unique <UNK> style i'll rate it 7 out of 10
<START> i really wanted to love this film i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it the book is marvelous this film is very far from the book the book is splendid this film is an awful adaptation br br in the book sara is honorable kind strong and never does anything <UNK> to get back at anyone that's the point of the book she behaves as a <UNK> regardless of circumstances an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return <UNK> it is to behave <UNK> regardless of how you are being treated br br in the book she <UNK> much and touches the lives of others other people change their <UNK> after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and sara does what is right simply because it is right br br outside of the <UNK> she comes upon a <UNK> girl who is more poor and hungry than she is she has half a dozen hot <UNK> she is very hungry she gives one <UNK> to this wild looking little girl <UNK> on the <UNK> of the <UNK> when she sees how <UNK> the girl is and watches her <UNK> the <UNK> she gives her another she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think i don't remember how many br br the baker is watching through the window she is so moved by what she has witnessed she takes the <UNK> girl in and raises her as her own daughter other people are similarly influenced by sara br br and in the book her father has died the man next door is her father's partner he has been looking for her her father did not lose his money after all the man is thrilled to find sara he takes her and <UNK> into his home and raises them as his daughters and sara has her full inheritance of course br br miss is not a <UNK> <UNK> in fact she remains in her same post at the school but she is <UNK> as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received and sara does speak to miss in the end miss is trying to <UNK> her treatment of sara and sara with a calm <UNK> demeanor <UNK> miss that she had been cruel br br there is no <UNK> for miss she continues on in her miserable existence it does not matter what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her and her <UNK> friend in the world <UNK> is now for all <UNK> and purposes her sister br br the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances it is about self control and <UNK> it is a wonderful book this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book my wife was so disgusted with it she wanted to leave the theater in the middle but we decided to stick it out we were not rewarded br br i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in i don't know but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it br br don't waste your time buy the book it is unforgettable even for a dad

<START> if you liked william <UNK> in <UNK> honor he <UNK> his character as don anthony in mob boss this is a very weak godfather satire with few laughs stuart <UNK> looks <UNK> as to what he's doing in this schlock fest morgan performance is one of the better efforts in the movie and that alone is not a good sign for sure eddie <UNK> between three stooges slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation <UNK> flawed mob boss is so derivative that boredom quickly <UNK> comedy and the film drags on with car chases hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense <UNK>
<START> i'm <UNK> to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of <UNK> last year at <UNK> comes to mind well x ain't no last year at <UNK> i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years x achieved <UNK> in that august group in my defense i believe i made a <UNK> effort to stand my ground hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the <UNK> just shy of the 90 minute mark quite respectable under the circumstances x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of <UNK> earlier work after a 10 year <UNK> that must have been bitter for him indeed <UNK> is still spinning in his grave
<START> it had its moments but overall when i watched this cartoon as a child i was bored out of my mind the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon probably my first exposure to anime it is also one of my least favorite <UNK> i remember others one involving a giant ship in space that made no sense but was more enjoyable because they were in space i also remember one with these people dressed like birds that was a bit strange but more entertaining i do not really like car racing though at all did not then and still do not so that is probably one of the reasons i did not care for this show even though today i am an avid anime fan the characters were a bit goofy too and then there was the horrible scenes where virtually no action was taking place that was probably used to cut down on animation costs and to pad the show the <UNK> in the cars were cool though and provided some entertainment for me back then overall i find this show to be rather unwatchable compared to newer <UNK> and some from the same era but this is just a personal opinion i am sure many other reviewers love the show which is cool
<START> spoilers spoilers wow what a <UNK> joanna has found herself in after accidentally running over a young child she goes to call for help only to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry <UNK> this is too much for her to handle and she <UNK> the scene luckily the child didn't die but is seriously injured and in a coma so starts the biggest struggle in life should she keep quiet or speak up at first she doesn't but eventually she realises that it's torture living with such a horrible secret br br at one point she even joins a search party to help find the <UNK> and gradually a detective starts to question this woman's behavior she wants to tell the truth and she never meant to run away from the crime scene but is it worth telling and having the whole town hate you for it br br the thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides joanna is very much a good role model even though she's made some wrong choices you feel for her even though you know what she did was wrong her journey is a good representation of what any human being would go through if something like this were to happen to them br br margaret colin is an absolutely brilliant actress she was amazing in the tv series now and again and great in films like independence day and the devil's own her performance here is so realistic and <UNK> that she carries us <UNK> through the entire film in the end i wanted to see more of her lisa <UNK> also provided some good supporting work as the gentle <UNK> detective br br to wrap it up if you wanna see a movie that will make you think long afterwards one that will say this is reality then you won't want to miss this one br br my rating 9 10
<START> seriously this film is not steve <UNK> is constantly forcing his tough guy dialogue and then giving everyone the evil eye all the time he just wasn't believable he seems like he's trying to be a <UNK> and he sucks at it i just remember him as the millionaire dad with the olsen twins in it takes two so this is a big change i rented this film for sean bean and he dies as usual only this time he didn't get <UNK> on a boat anchor <UNK> games <UNK> by a giant satellite dish <UNK> or get run over by <UNK> the field he just got shot real quick like and civil and that was all i got from this film that they didn't kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way how sad is that i was only watching it for the 3 seconds that sean was in it and then the rest was rubbish i actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasn't one seemed a little like mission impossible with the hole <UNK> there's a mole it's the leader of the group and no one expected it let's trap him let's frame the underdog good guy so we can get away with it cliched and tired this movie was a waste of time
<START> olivia <UNK> in a wet t shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it other than that this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of <UNK> is not worth <UNK> time the writing is bad the acting is poor and the direction is sub standard
<START> this movie is on cable <UNK> and i never really watched it thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film america with the usual trite story about american freedom etc but it was not it was so much more br br of course martin sheen is excellent i have never seen him in a movie i haven't loved even if the script is bad because he is so talented kathy bates is the overbearing mom and does a great job the real surprise is <UNK> <UNK> who has not always been in the greatest films but also directed this movie please don't stereotype him from the breakfast club movie he is so much better in this and i wish he would do more non commercial <UNK> hollywood movies br br the film is realistic as we see <UNK> home from vietnam during <UNK> <UNK> williams is passable as the sister who feels she is <UNK> and embarrassed by the returning soldier her brother he is quite <UNK> from the family and especially at this time in us history this story is very relevant br br i learned a great deal about post traumatic stress and you will genuinely empathize with this character this is not a violent <UNK> portrayal like platoon for example it is more of a character study which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims with today's violence it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad and shed a tear this does it and deserves recognition
<START> when the <UNK> chair <UNK> beware of its soft colorful br br the movie starts out quite well josh mark and emily kathryn are a boyfriend girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a <UNK> to his father's house where josh plans to deliver a <UNK> for his <UNK> birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up <UNK> <UNK> brother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> looking fellow more in touch with other <UNK> lives than his own br br the <UNK> quickly <UNK> into more <UNK> between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the <UNK> chair it is initially very <UNK> and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to <UNK> it <UNK> quickly that the cause of all of emily and <UNK> problems is the and sets it to the torch one night br br and that's the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the film br br the big issue is that the title of the film is the <UNK> chair when it isn't the chair at all that takes center stage it is josh and <UNK> doomed relationship and how the <UNK> <UNK> their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed there's never another mention of it even though they arrive at <UNK> parents place on his father's birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father there's no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the <UNK> chair and why isn't there a tie in with it at the end bad script br br the other annoying thing is that mark brother jay is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoom in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the <UNK> <UNK> catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearable br br the acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actors actresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of <UNK> to the title caused this flick too many problems
<START> this review is based on the english language version br br orson welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that unfinished it should have been left as such not thrown together in this clumsy boring <UNK> of whatever material was available br br while i'm sure it was done with the best of intentions the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to welles' vision they've also managed to <UNK> it by <UNK> this version upon audiences br br the first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances they're also inconsistent welles' original <UNK> using his own voice as he often did have been <UNK> in a handful of scenes they don't match at all there hasn't been the slightest attempt at <UNK> add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects <UNK> a long sequence during a huge festival including the running of the <UNK> sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd that's meant to be in the thousands br br however the real problem is the <UNK> fact that <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> it's <UNK> obvious from watching this the film consists of a handful of scenes strung together dragged out to ridiculous <UNK> just to make up the running time case in point the sequence where <UNK> <UNK> for don <UNK> in the city goes on forever it's just <UNK> approaching people in the crowd asking them the same questions over over again there is no way that welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety but that's what appears here it lasts over twelve minutes when in fact it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film br br while the start of the film is relatively complete rather well done the rest has massive holes which simply can't be filled with endless <UNK> of spanish countryside still more shots of don <UNK> <UNK> going back forth there's also no ending no resolution no conclusion no punchline no point br br although there is material in private <UNK> that was <UNK> to the filmmakers that couldn't possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete coherent work welles simply didn't complete shooting largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish br br however putting aside the fact that it wasn't complete never could be one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough unfortunately by putting it all together in such a <UNK> manner one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall in particular what was clearly a terrific performance from <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> is utterly ruined with the new voice with long drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritating br br orson welles' vision for this film was something far more ambitious complex than a simple retelling of the story of don <UNK> but that's what has been attempted here as such the point is lost the only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been welles himself he didn't br br the footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary <UNK> the whole saga of welles trying to make the film welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a <UNK> when are you going to finish don <UNK>
<START> what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination everything is said it is like a documentary film but not as good as a documentary because it is no documentary a <UNK> film without a continuous story very superficial nothing to think about because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is quite poor the film is quite boring
<START> basic summary used to be a community of witches and escaped the <UNK> witch <UNK> by <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> the first born males <UNK> from these families have supernatural powers and must come to terms with the seductive <UNK> nature of using those powers br br well i usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5 going from there br br production 1 for very obvious audio out of sync 1 for nicely done special effects the <UNK> actually gave me chills 0 5 for nice <UNK> i like the dull blue 0 5 for the stupid sound track 0 5 for the opening sequence i'm a sucker for stylish <UNK> and flashy title design br br story script 1 for decent main idea 0 5 for matrix street fighter ripoff <UNK> 1 for not explaining some plot threads very well <UNK> <UNK> 1 for boring predictable ending 1 for gratuitous exposition both as words on the screen and as bland br br acting characterization 0 5 for bad bad acting although it gets a little better as the film progresses 1 for lack of character development especially among all the females br br other 1 for gratuitous male and female nudity which is fun to watch and 0 5 for no sex scenes which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot 1 for hitting its target audience teenage sci fi horror thriller fans even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genres br br conclusion this is not a film this is a movie there's really nothing to analyze it's just good relatively clean fun lots of really attractive actors and actresses lots of boys fighting in the style of and street fighter if you like cute actors and actresses supernatural special effects and or <UNK> fun plots this movie is for you if you prefer oscar worthy <UNK> produced film masterpieces with tons of multi layered <UNK> plot threads and groundbreaking <UNK> techniques you probably won't like this film br br using my twisted logic this movie gets a 4 10
<START> it is a <UNK> that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception br br i am no lover of <UNK> but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to <UNK> everything to black and white as well as make events even fictional ones in novels fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme br br <UNK> smith is <UNK> but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful <UNK> of a movie br br sad really for those who will never read smith they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition br br the indiana jones movies were snappy to attempt to <UNK> that by <UNK> smith's novels into this production misses out by a country mile br br pathetic except for the photography and art <UNK>
<START> life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer he had a great job and a loving wife no actually his wife wasn't so loving for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife joanna had a suit case packed and was heading out the door he tried to stop her but she just got into the elevator and out of ted's life well now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6 year old son billy ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way it did however affect his performance as a father he blew up when billy <UNK> punch on his client artwork well some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back ted was <UNK> well he was late coming home from work on <UNK> birthday which made billy sore at him br br ted was late to work one day and his boss <UNK> at him because he had missed a very important client meeting when he got home he <UNK> at billy for <UNK> ice cream during dinner then later he <UNK> told billy that the break up between he and joanna may have been his fault not <UNK> ted invited a good friend <UNK> bernard over that night and well billy got his first look at a naked woman when ted took billy to the park the following day he fell off the jungle gym and landed face first onto his toy plane ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to <UNK> <UNK> after that life began taking a <UNK> spiral for ted then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna they met in a corner <UNK> at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her ted would have none of it and <UNK> out well life got even worse for ted when his boss jim <UNK> took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy and without a job ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning he hired himself a lawyer john who charged a pretty penny 15 000 exact change and that's if they win br br ted was also able to find a new job it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in <UNK> but he accepted with great determination finally the court date january 9 1980 arrived judge <UNK> <UNK> joanna took the stand and <UNK> to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures the next day ted took the stand and lawyer really <UNK> him like a ted's good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters well the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough one day informs ted that he lost joanna got sole custody of billy how typical always <UNK> in favor of the mother well ted and billy were just <UNK> about <UNK> ways they had a <UNK> goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by she and ted have a little talk and well rather than just give away the ending let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody br br this was a very good movie dustin hoffman was very good he earned that academy award i've also seen him in hook meet the and rain man which he also won an oscar for meryl streep was good she also got an oscar justin henry was good too so where was his nomination i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children but the rule was lifted when <UNK> joel <UNK> came along this movie has great drama light comedy and is very subtle it does a good job of holding your attention i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn't help but watch and that's what you should do if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre then i recommend kramer vs kramer a gripping film about the <UNK> of two divorced parents fighting over their child i liked ted's little speech about <UNK> in favor of mothers all the time what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually that's how they have the child but seriously he's right why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman also in the cast george <UNK> howard duff who passed away in 1990 and <UNK> chamberlain who passed away in 1984 watch for an up and coming <UNK> williams in the nudity in the <UNK> scene anyway see kramer vs kramer today good movie br br
<START> shopping sunny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings welcome to the life of <UNK> brooks and her friends <UNK> brooks is portrayed by jamie <UNK> spears the self <UNK> actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent it's confirmed that <UNK> has indeed gone to the dogs with <UNK> when <UNK> the actress who portrayed dana <UNK> in the first season left the show all hope <UNK> as she was the only decent actress the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media if they continue to pursue jamie <UNK> spears as the picture of perfection very many people will have to lower their standards with hope they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing jamie <UNK> spears is useless for acting singing and anything else she attempts for that <UNK> spiral she calls a career there is no wondering why she is a self <UNK> actress critics would most definitely <UNK> her as something other than that
<START> ok small town clueless sheriff check <UNK> hot daughter check <UNK> do well boyfriend of <UNK> hot daughter whom sheriff hates check corporate land <UNK> who puts profit over people check <UNK> rank and file accidentally <UNK> a <UNK> monster then being <UNK> to cover it up check natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were check amateurish cgi special effects that could have been produced by a <UNK> 64 computer check seriously virtually all the clichés of your typical sci fi original movie have been <UNK> into a classic so bad it's good movie the only one that's missing is the scientist expert trying to <UNK> his knowledge there is a <UNK> with three students who get <UNK> my the bone eater fairly early in the movie but they are basically extras in the movie and i can honestly say that i predicted virtually all of this right down to who survives and who doesn't though i have to say i got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong by about an hour i swear i could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters despite all this the movie is fun to watch if for no other reason than to play mst3k with your friends if you're up for some mindless fun it's a great movie to watch which is why i give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4 even though for all <UNK> and purposes it deserves a much much lower rating but then again you wouldn't tune in to a scifi original movie if you were looking for a movie with an actual plot <UNK> characters or good special effects would you
<START> this is a crummy film a <UNK> to a genre of surprise ending movies and a genre that has been done so much better before the plot <UNK> along with a predictable ending yawn the characters are unlikeable and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable matt dillon a fine intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered the others are forgettable much of the dialog is <UNK> again a <UNK> trying to be witty i wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my <UNK> list yes it's that bad <UNK> from misogynistic to just plain gross as in beyond frat house gross with so much real talent out there i'm really surprised this movie ever got made it shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits
<START> i rented this film from because of the cover and title sounded intriguing this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense the monsters needed more face time we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more oh sh moments the photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re <UNK> blows up there were too many close ups but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom overall i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers but this movie is definitely a below average rent br br there are definitely better picks i would recommend 1 or 2 over this pick
<START> <UNK> is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to <UNK> and sell immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job then his girlfriend gets drunk and <UNK> on him so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous br br <UNK> minutes none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds the ending is literally the worst i've ever seen i want the other <UNK> minutes of my life back br br i hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public the script can't be longer than twenty pages and the budget must have been <UNK> because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car the only <UNK> use for <UNK> in my opinion is if you're holding someone hostage and want to <UNK> them beyond human thought if so get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made <UNK> wreck within the day br br one and a half out of 10
<START> mixed group of experts <UNK> <UNK> and scientists venture a mile underground and go another 2 4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote where they find giant <UNK> <UNK> and some big razor <UNK> <UNK> computer generated creatures lurking about the cave is sealed off by a and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit and that's all she wrote with this low aiming effort that even fails to combine action science fiction and horror on the most <UNK> of levels imagine if someone gave the folks at the sci fi channel 30 million dollars to make a monster movie that's precisely what the cave is like almost startling in its <UNK> at times full of clichés and almost entirely <UNK> on the special effects to entertain the only difference is they had more money to build sets more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway otherwise it's business as usual some of these movies are still fun to watch this one is not and there are loads of reasons why br br 1 it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is br br 2 the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the <UNK> br br 3 unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not <UNK> anyone in this day and age br br 4 <UNK> <UNK> and quick cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy unimaginative film making and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying <UNK> such as fire and explosion of <UNK> it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a no <UNK> action level br br 5 even though it wants you take to it seriously the script is full of clichés the dialogue is awful and there's no attempt whatsoever at characterization casting 25 year old looking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran <UNK> might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight sorry you can't have it both ways br br 6 there were two exceptions to the model rule as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe these were the first two characters killed off br br 7 for a little diversity they also <UNK> in a black guy and a chinese guy strangely neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as <UNK> <UNK> what their next move will be insulting br br 8 furthermore how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end ugh give me a break already br br 9 much of the acting was horrible cole <UNK> performance was completely laughable the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and <UNK> by using the <UNK> <UNK> smile makes all the ladies <UNK> technique which is the pg 13 gender switch equivalent to my large breasts make all the guys <UNK> technique often used by ladies in r rated films either way his performance was completely <UNK> in daniel kim from the tv series lost and <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> up the room with their stilted and <UNK> line delivery br br 10 was the ending a joke absolutely terrible please god we do not need a sequel to this garbage br br so basically i wouldn't bother with this one unless you've never seen a monster movie before or if you're just really desperate and the only other thing on is the simple life the sets were good the blue <UNK> photography is ok and a few of the actors lena <UNK> marcel tried their best so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a 2
<START> looking back on the year 2006 one of the things i will remember most is the on the internet for a film called snakes on a plane but unknown to me there was a straight to dvd rip off film called snakes on a train after seeing this i feel its at best a below par b movie br br the plot br br a husband and wife get on a train to go to los angles to get help form the husbands uncle who is a <UNK> this is because the wife's family do not <UNK> of her <UNK> him so they have put a curse on her that snakes will become her thought with a sixteen hour drive to los angles and a group of passengers the include an ex <UNK> cop and some drug <UNK> will they get there in time before the snakes take her over br br view on the film first the effects i have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory way the main effect shots you have to wait <UNK> minutes to see are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film the film makes video games look like <UNK> next to this one of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film and the directors make the film so anti climatic it ruins the whole film final view on the film br br a below par b movie with an unbelievably bad ending
<START> fame is a very well done portrait of the students who inhabit new york city's high school of the arts the film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school director alan parker allows each of the <UNK> students to mature on screen allowing you to feel a connection with each one the music here is <UNK> and fun the dancing is exciting and fresh the film eventually became the basis for an emmy winning television series starring debbie allen and some of the other actors from the film one of the more enjoyable dance films of the 1980's received oscars for music 8 10
<START> i don't particularly care from michael jackson aside from being a <UNK> i really do not like his music with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album thriller this is one of them i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made br br this was directed by john <UNK> best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london this music video is not so much a music video but more or less a short horror film m j and his date are at a werewolf movie when they leave the movie they are attacked by a <UNK> of <UNK> zombies when michael jackson does his famous thriller dance br br you know this actually is a pretty good song with good <UNK> beats this and beat it are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over i especially love vincent <UNK> cameo as the narrator his distinctive voice is perfect for a horror themed music video even if you don't like m j 's music you need to see this video at least once by the way he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose
<START> wesley snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess horribly reminiscent of steven <UNK> latest works the script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good sadly too snipes has fallen into the trap of having an <UNK> voice double doing much of his dialogue and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie it's sad to see a guy of wesley snipes talent doing garbage like this film and producing a tired and clearly bored performance barely bothered to produce his own dialogue it's become somewhat of a joke with steven seagal the fact he doesn't perform his own dialogue but it's not something i'd have expected from snipes perhaps it's due to the producer andrew stevens who has worked with seagal previously or the director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> responsible for <UNK> <UNK> bad out of reach br br the plot involves shady government officials terrorists who coach soccer teams <UNK> with <UNK> evidence on and a <UNK> chuck of missing money oh and <UNK> weapons now how they are connected i don't know but what i can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to <UNK> and like many of these <UNK> movies this likes to include one twist too many the plot is also told playing out it's cards with people having shady one to ones in <UNK> and dark <UNK> etc it's all kind of lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad <UNK> watching this film the pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the <UNK> of the performances and the storyline the film does have some nice action scenes as an example of how a <UNK> film has successfully put across a storyline of a <UNK> nature i give you dolph <UNK> directorial debut the <UNK> that movie had it's share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action with dolph under siege form terrorists the plot points are told in the context of action on the move while avoiding death the movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening it doesn't break up the pace as such although the plot was a little convoluted it was more forgivable cause the action never let up the <UNK> like too many of these films stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who's bad and who isn't before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end these movies can often suffer with pacing issues br br snipes himself as i mentioned is pretty bland here at the beginning he's putting on a camp persona as he's undercover with some arms dealers initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double <UNK> through the role snipes only comes alive when he's called upon to kick ass there's some nice action here though with some swift and <UNK> martial arts and some nicely <UNK> <UNK> the film also features a decent car chase <UNK> co star and she's not much of an actress but she is gorgeous with a costume that screams look at my <UNK> the rest of the cast <UNK> in and out with clichéd and uninteresting roles br br snipes thankfully has better projects <UNK> up from now he has another team up with mario van <UNK> called hard luck then he will do chasing the dragon from the director chris who did jet <UNK> kiss of the dragon finally snipes is apparently doing <UNK> a <UNK> drama directed by danny glover the future is suddenly looking <UNK> for snipes but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his <UNK> films around a movie possibly more it's also funny to consider that of all these <UNK> god's dolph lundgren is doing the better films directing himself with the enjoyable <UNK> and the <UNK> violent and nicely done the russian <UNK> and what's more he's doing them on a <UNK> of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from wesley and steven seagal are producing 1 2
<START> if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be you must try this one it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a 25 porn booth and you can just about smell the <UNK> on the floor kathleen turner <UNK> around in a blond wig getting her kicks from pretending to be a two bit hooker she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect and tony <UNK> plays a hysterical priest who is out to maybe murderer her yet another movie that ends with tony <UNK> in drag annie <UNK> shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit which is reason enough to hate this movie the kinky will love the sex scenes so rent the <UNK> version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing
<START> contains spoilers br br as a fan of <UNK> leigh cook i watched for this show to finally come on so that i could see it i taped it so i could watch it several times and there is something about this show that really bothers me br br i recognize that this was a made for tv movie not only that but it was made for lifetime which is a channel that i despise because it was made for tv i can ignore the huge plot holes i can ignore the massive lack of character development in ally <UNK> character i can overlook the fact that george c scott and <UNK> leigh cook both of whom are very talented actors were <UNK> not reaching the best of their abilities i can look past the fact that don character was so <UNK> that you knew when you saw him he was the villain i can even pass over the obvious mistake in the <UNK> she's raped during her winter break and then over a year later she has the baby from it br br the major thing that i can't get over is this there are two trials for the custody of the child in the first trial custody is awarded to the child's father because he is better educated has a degree from a community college and has a full time job in the second trial the judgement is <UNK> because the judge feels that there is lack of evidence that emma character is an <UNK> mother and custody shouldn't be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child br br the problem is this nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration whether it was a rape or not he had sex with a minor wouldn't that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he's a mature adult mature adults don't have sex with <UNK> br br it's not the worst cable movie that you would ever see but it's not a great show either out of
<START> miyazaki has been doing his <UNK> since the 70s and it's only been recently that his movies have made it american <UNK> via disney and fans <UNK> over his great talent is no exception although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort of japanese in its presentation for the same reason <UNK> is very japanese and doesn't make much sense to us audiences so too are some elements of this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendship br br what does come across well is miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters he steps out of his zone a bit with as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high <UNK> although not lonely is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and <UNK> of the sea similar to spirited away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and <UNK> nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different br br i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after spirited away he gave us <UNK> moving castle is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his <UNK> and continues to delight and <UNK> the most creative animated movies of all time watch with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you'll be transported back to when catching <UNK> and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown up stuff and eating your <UNK>
<START> the man who knew too much falls into that hitchcock middle ground that <UNK> many of his films during the 1950s not a masterpiece of suspense by any means but an awful lot of fun nonetheless br br james stewart and doris day play a <UNK> couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is going to be <UNK> during a particular <UNK> clash in the score the <UNK> hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the br br so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play that i have to believe that film was inspired by this neither film is a big deal but both are easy to enjoy br br grade b
<START> while killing time on a saturday morning looking for lola came on hbo i decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad it was even worse than i could imagine the movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on screen chemistry between the lead actors that i found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes between mike lead actor in scenes in which he <UNK> the bill at a fancy restaurant and where lola lead actress allows him to use her <UNK> house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich it was almost as bad as him <UNK> about people around him doing the <UNK> it was horrible and the two actors ultimately falling in love i kept wanting to change the channel but i was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles it never did in fact it became so bad that i decided to finish it just so i can claim that i watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety instead of being criticized for not giving it a fair chance the last scene where lola tries out for a dance part was the <UNK> of the movie she comes in late after getting married even that scene where mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just <UNK> the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie and then somehow convinces the judges to give her a look the two male judges are already put off with how late she is but after watching her <UNK> around the stage ok she dances fine but not overly impressive everybody joins in including lola and <UNK> families other dancers that were there and <UNK> even the judges bad horrible terrible it was so bad i had to write a review watch at your own risk
<START> top gun without the in house <UNK> or class or money or cruise an excuse for an <UNK> mobile cast of next big thing actors to market their ability to lead a <UNK> this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is <UNK> almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece <UNK> br br dennis <UNK> is a <UNK> actor for me but in this film he is fine particularly the action sequences michael <UNK> is a first class action hero but not a leading man charlie sheen is to all <UNK> and purposes the leading man but never quite an action hero there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also 3 10

<START> what can be said about one of the greatest <UNK> games ever that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned <UNK> veteran <UNK> bullets quite literally that the graphics are great down to the explosions that everyone loves to see that nothing is quite as fun as playing <UNK> mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with <UNK> guns br br very little beats <UNK> <UNK> about the only thing missing was voice acting and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers if you have an <UNK> and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage get a copy of this
<START> the movie jennifer with <UNK> <UNK> and howard duff is film noir <UNK> this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times i love the stark black and white film noir movies film noir in color is not as good the cast and script is excellent the rather creepy music is fun to listen to <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like she was not only <UNK> beautiful she was a fine actress the first movie that i remember seeing <UNK> <UNK> in was <UNK> with richard widmark and <UNK> <UNK> i never forgot the movie or her i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains and even though the movies were not her usual fare she was still delightful in them as an actress howard duff is always terrific to watch i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone i have this movie on vhs tape
<START> i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some <UNK> like you who is into lesbian stuff br br the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny her lips are so <UNK> but she's really lame and insecure she tries to come off like a <UNK> guy better than dressing <UNK> but still weird and definitely the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man oh right to get the poor dumb girl i forgot she makes all these dumb <UNK> which are not funny and she's a really lousy actress plus that <UNK> look is so out br br this dumb blond girl from <UNK> place plays surprise a dumb blond br br she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy they even make out <UNK> i guess that part was sort of funny
<START> this is a quirky heist caper film one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene the protagonist is a <UNK> who goes to work in a little carnival where he's paid to kill the <UNK> belly dancer wife then ends up falling for her himself she's <UNK> <UNK> and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of <UNK> trick the film's other props include her <UNK> husband <UNK> played by the talented <UNK> <UNK> some nasty <UNK> <UNK> and most important to the plot a <UNK> full of money just like the old shell game the one where you have to guess which one the under you'll be guessing who's got the money and like the victims of the <UNK> who run such games you'll probably guess wrong as lovely is a talented performer and an <UNK> whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her <UNK> on all the unfortunate men in her <UNK> norman <UNK> is fine as the young con who is by the <UNK> beauty he was paid to kill don't count him out however for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for this oddball film is worth a look
<START> since this show was changed from the screen to attack of the show it has gone down hill with <UNK> and kevin rose alex etc made the show awesome then they got fired from for an unknown reason when the show switched to it became less about computers and more about <UNK> and magazines it also promoted bands that nobody had heard of or cared about finally i couldn't watch it anymore once kevin rose left he kept it interesting but he went off to do his own thing which is good kevin rose now has several online <UNK> casts and shows etc on the <UNK> 3 network check it out com i think you can get to it by going to www <UNK> if you want a real tech show rather than then go watch kevin <UNK> shows or listen to the <UNK> br br j
