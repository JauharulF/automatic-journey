<START> a <UNK> farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas this film is hilarious admittedly you have to have a taste for films with screaming hysterical dialogue over the top acting and melodramatic plot twists but if you do you're in for one hell of a treat br br sally field plays <UNK> <UNK> daytime tv's queen of misery <UNK> <UNK> life is thrown into <UNK> with the unexpected arrival of <UNK> craven <UNK> <UNK> her long lost niece and simultaneously jeffrey anderson kevin kline splendid as always <UNK> long ago lover but <UNK> has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of <UNK> and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface add in the diabolical montana <UNK> a wonderful cathy <UNK> in full gorgeous woman with <UNK> to spare mode who is trying mighty hard to destroy <UNK> career david robert downey jr the <UNK> boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with montana to ruin <UNK> and rose <UNK> whoopi goldberg scriptwriter and <UNK> one true <UNK> and you are in for a <UNK> helping of subplots and general chaos br br chaotic comedies like this are <UNK> to <UNK> does anyone remember <UNK> <UNK> but when done well can be pretty damn funny a major <UNK> that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look field kline goldberg and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm <UNK> is clearly the weakest link here but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field kline et al <UNK> is a stand out in the <UNK> <UNK> role making you think of the <UNK> damn <UNK> you ever did see there are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small but nevertheless all very funny roles including carrie fisher <UNK> marshall kathy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the <UNK> plot moving toward the big finish mention must also be made of robert <UNK> screenplay carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera the dialogue is <UNK> over with great lines delivered brilliantly by the actors i'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised br br look if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it get your hands on this one if not for anything else it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh

<START> did francis ford coppola have a brain <UNK> some time after directing apocalypse now that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie br br you have to wonder what the director of the godfather and the conversation was thinking when he made this <UNK> film it gives kathleen turner a starring vehicle playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to <UNK> her <UNK> knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her and turner the <UNK> that she is does what she can with it but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone br br it doesn't even have any style to it and given its director one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have that br br grade c
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent the acting is absurd the costumes even <UNK> and the story is non existent this <UNK> <UNK> sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that <UNK> and conan enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along the lead character is tepid and dull he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the <UNK> century all the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse don't even bother with this crap
<START> a confused mess from start to finish like they used to say about the <UNK> there was a secret message if you played the <UNK> <UNK> if one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start you'd come away with the same degree of disappointment br br apart from all of this psychedelic <UNK> <UNK> of flashbacks and false starts the <UNK> characters were the movie <UNK> out for revenge if the movie didn't get <UNK> there was nothing to like about these two either overacting shouting and <UNK> were delivered in comic book fashion i think one dimensional was an <UNK> br br okay so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes <UNK> in the fact that unlike them we <UNK> just didn't get it well i'm afraid there was nothing to get and the two <UNK> sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish a non existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that and by far the worst not a single character you cared about in the least
<START> robert wagner is the evil boss of <UNK> a <UNK> company with a virus that kills people br br <UNK> you're saying that the <UNK> virus has become a real virus that can kill people that may be <UNK> possible but not possible from my <UNK> br br <UNK> having to write some new virus <UNK> of my own to trap it it may take some <UNK> br br <UNK> it's not going after <UNK> it's killing <UNK> br br watch out for the <UNK> into <UNK> love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by <UNK> keyboard
<START> what a load of rubbish i can't even begin to describe how awful this film was the rating it has here is really hard to believe br br avoid particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger <UNK> the first one was well written well directed well executed a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere the second one was <UNK> decent as a self standing film but clearly not up to the level of the first the third is an insult to the series period i rate the films 10 6 1 it's that bad br br oh and yes it really is set in the past the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald all muddled in with some half <UNK> native american mythology the sisters don't have any real story or progression or even a clear relationship they're just trying to survive and be <UNK> <UNK> that's about as deep as it gets br br <UNK> that the girls agreed to be in this pile of <UNK> after reading the script br br oh and another thing staging of action was terrible people appearing from nowhere regularly like the girls turn around and there's an elaborate candle lit setup with a <UNK> native american woman just sitting there about to go into a speech sets were terrible couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set which really didn't help also there was consistently snow outside the camp but not a trace inside on the set br br <UNK> so bad i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one
<START> what the hell is this <UNK> drama lawyers in loony tunes land the world's <UNK> most duck faced actress even more duck faced and <UNK> than michelle pfeiffer overacts her <UNK> butt off making <UNK> <UNK> that would shame bugs bunny in one of the most animated non animated tv series ever this is also the most annoying one hour format tv show ever hence the worst br br all the men act like <UNK> and i for one refuse to believe that even hip big city <UNK> are all as <UNK> male like as this sorry short bunch <UNK> peter <UNK> manages to be even more irritating than <UNK> <UNK> with his fake hollywood <UNK> speech <UNK> it's the sort of pseudo inability to <UNK> the letter s by turning it into a moronic sh that the likes of jon <UNK> and christian <UNK> also practice with <UNK> watching <UNK> talk i always wonder how come his jaw doesn't <UNK> human facial <UNK> was never meant to support the <UNK> of the sh sound more than three times per second he is a medical wonder br br this badly conceived and written legal drama comedy <UNK> also features some very 90s pc it has political correctness written with huge <UNK> letters is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyers being full of ideals high principles and moral <UNK> laughable but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in hollywood since its <UNK> after all what is more noble than defending a murderer a rapist or a thief when a tv series as retarded as ally <UNK> starts preaching to america about how it should run the country then it must be time for paris hilton to become president ally <UNK> is both a product of recent and large scale western <UNK> down and a <UNK> of it br br those supposed touches of <UNK> like the unbelievably annoying musical numbers are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny this is no monty python whatever new the talent free makers of this garbage were aiming for they failed with <UNK> ally <UNK> is a highly <UNK> tv venture aimed at <UNK> <UNK> bored <UNK> and <UNK> lawyers it's yet another dull <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> your honour may i call the witness <UNK> <UNK> that the american audiences seem to eat up with <UNK> for some strange reason
<START> how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them <UNK> up with enough cops to run a mini war that include such weapons as <UNK> you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly <UNK> newspaper <UNK> someone saying <UNK> to a corrupt cop br br you will never get your <UNK> minutes back life is too precious to rent this movie br br i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie br br if you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him br br however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie
<START> this is one very confusing movie the film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense the fury of the <UNK> was made in spain and i think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant maybe this is part of the problem but i doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film the dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well the scenes are choppy there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more what i did like about this film was the look of the <UNK> himself and the scenes where he attacks now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense they might have had something don't waste your time on this one
<START> polish film maker <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> french 1975 aka the beast is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too this film tells everything that's generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images the images may look wild perverse sick or exciting but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned sex desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it they interest and <UNK> us so <UNK> and by our nature that they are considered scary <UNK> and something too wild to be true br br a sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a french countryside to meet her soon to become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind all are very exciting and each <UNK> parents and relatives wait <UNK> to see the new people arriving to their families the innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful french mansion with all its humans and animals and a mysterious la <UNK> that turns out to be something that the characters nor most of the film's audience could have never imagined to be real and in front of them br br the film is about the same theme as canadian david <UNK> <UNK> feature <UNK> 1975 which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory <UNK> spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act <UNK> and violently in their lust for pleasure and <UNK> of instincts human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal a beast be it a lust for blood revenge or sex and <UNK> pleasure humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us the film opens greatly and very shockingly for most <UNK> attitudes showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the <UNK> and continue the race but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there not the close ups of organs as could be so easily claimed the horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat in heat that's much stronger than his will as he doesn't have any control at that point anymore the power of the instinct makes an animal a beast br br after the memorable beginning the characters get introduced and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their <UNK> to the adults and <UNK> that all represent their own part of the <UNK> creating the face of human life on screen a film doesn't necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race including the urban and countryside inhabitants and both <UNK> the mansion makes the protagonist girl's sexuality wake as she <UNK> the horses <UNK> and acting like she obviously has never thought of for the first time she sees something unique and something that <UNK> and feels almost vital for her and her body like getting water when you're very <UNK> the transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her with his mother and camera and a letter boyfriend even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a <UNK> but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades man's stupidity and <UNK> to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise <UNK> br br the film's last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk as the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the <UNK> form of ourselves having lived in the woods without other people <UNK> near him the dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film's overall straight and honest attitude and the images are so easy to be judged as perverse and pornographic without a courage to go deeper into them character reactions and thoughts behind what we see the images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the <UNK> more human character and <UNK> forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a normal sexual act between a man and a female which is a beautiful thing and expression of love another human need also the numerous and cleverly <UNK> humorous love making scenes inside the mansion between the young mother and the black servant get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant for example and there's no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesn't become any more pleasant by the <UNK> <UNK> has managed to paint his images so beautiful and sensitive that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art he uses dialogue only when it's necessary otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful br br death is also there as flesh dies sooner or later after years of life and instincts it dies the ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and revealing ending too another <UNK> humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for they visited the mansion of truth about flesh us and them the film reminds me of french writer georges <UNK> story of the eye with its same themes about <UNK> death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh the book is well written and fantastic as well as this film and naturally both have been blamed for their too explicit content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments br br <UNK> film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film the sun shines through the trees and to <UNK> where humans live and the beauty of it is always there but so is the <UNK> that <UNK> by the inhabitants of the world to every innocent white sheep there's a selfish evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep present inside every human soul it is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active the <UNK> of some of our instincts is not a bad thing and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad they can be satisfied without exploitation violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it human is not more than an animal with intelligence intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment <UNK> film is a masterpiece unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with <UNK> theme and also an example of how much can be achieved expressed and given by a film maker who is also only a human
<START> with lots of sunshine <UNK> light and shadow <UNK> through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with hand held camera quick paced editing and extreme close ups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done film br br the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely <UNK> aka <UNK> played by louise brooks a bit of a show off in front of the <UNK> men by <UNK> she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest much to the <UNK> of her very jealous stick in the mud fiancé a pretty annoying fellow really <UNK> down the <UNK> the ten contestants display themselves in <UNK> while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause i was wondering couldn't the girls just walk slower to <UNK> their length of time and thus applause on the <UNK> <UNK> is soon being chased by a prince and a <UNK> but her hot headed beau doesn't like the <UNK> paid to her by other men or her <UNK> public for that matter i guess he just wants her in his house cooking his <UNK> and staying out of sight eh br br louise brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and i found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing
<START> unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation the <UNK> ruining it for us <UNK> if this movie wasn't made for tv it should have been it's so remarkably low budget <UNK> <UNK> and hits every 70's cliche except disco nobody is likeable and you could <UNK> what happens to anyone in this one <UNK> <UNK> except for the bad bad performances
<START> i just saw this film <UNK> toronto international film festival fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed and if you are not familiar with this director's <UNK> doesn't matter this film can definitely stand all on its own i have to go the second screening it was amazing i need to see it again and fast br br this film is very funny it's dialogue is very smart and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim fay grim is the latest feature <UNK> the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool 2000 visually the most <UNK> <UNK> feature employs the <UNK> use of the <UNK> or dutch angle which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts available in the possible films short works by hal hartley 1994 2004 collection and in the girl from monday 2005 br br i viewed this film most <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fay <UNK> adventure in this story is <UNK> against the changed world after september 11 2001 without going into major spoilers i view this work and story world as a <UNK> political and original portrait of <UNK> politics that is rarely if ever <UNK> in mainstream fictional cinema post <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of side note mark cuban <UNK> <UNK> in both these films most interesting to say the least br br lastly for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool <UNK> fay and henry this film is hilariously self conscious and self <UNK> that being said the character of fay <UNK> starts off in the film exactly where she was when henry fool ended but by the end of the film <UNK> knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family i can't wait for the third part in this story
<START> this will be brief let me first state that i'm <UNK> and not exactly crazy about <UNK> especially <UNK> fanatics however this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his <UNK> mother for not letting him play video games i just couldn't take it seriously mentioning how <UNK> thought he was christ to illustrate the point that <UNK> can breed evil i don't know it was just cheap and childish made the opposition look ignorant furthermore the narrator just seemed <UNK> and pretentious the delivery was complete <UNK> i can't take this documentary seriously might appeal to an angry teenager <UNK> off at his <UNK> mother for not letting him play video games
<START> this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war it had memories from dances with wolves for the big <UNK> indians military fights from barry <UNK> for the british <UNK> lights <UNK> br br unfortunately the script is awful the continuity of the story is lacking cuts with 5 months later 3 years later the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept <UNK> at each other above all wait for the ending you understand how to kill a story imagine the same in titanic br br sometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker unfortunately <UNK> hudson is a poor one he has already committed <UNK> and i find again the same flaws no dynamic in scenes in editing in <UNK> it is long dull flat br br i knew that this movie was a disaster for <UNK> career now i understand finally this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me a painful one
<START> this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has <UNK> <UNK> work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand the only star in this is <UNK> s vanessa <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> before it <UNK> and she is a good actress i like low budget film <UNK> ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed <UNK> <UNK> t one of them this movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed
<START> surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing <UNK> to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema <UNK> <UNK> gives a truly stunning multi <UNK> performance at times <UNK> and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france
<START> i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on <UNK> and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used <UNK> so my critical vote is bomb nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
<START> this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with <UNK> on skin br br the plot is absolutely bizarre i fail to see any sensual or erotic undertones the plot turns an ancient art form into a <UNK> pornography in addition the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying bad parts of hong kong such as the airport in the middle of the city poor living conditions and noise <UNK> throughout the whole film i keep thinking that the <UNK> book is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment br br the <UNK> book is a perverted yet boring film seriously stay away from it
<START> a team of <UNK> <UNK> a real treasure  the crown of the queen of <UNK> from egypt the crown is to be transferred via <UNK> to san francisco but it won't be an easy journey there are plenty of would be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless <UNK> contained in the crown fortunately for all involved mr <UNK> is on hand to guard the crown on its journey however that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure br br after the disappointment of mr <UNK> <UNK> i went into mr <UNK> takes a vacation hoping for the best but admittedly <UNK> the worst but within the first 10 seconds of the film i knew i would find it more enjoyable i'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with <UNK> <UNK> in egypt and seeing <UNK> disguised as a german <UNK> imagine that peter lorre playing a german the beginning scenes really drew me in while the movie may have quickly <UNK> to the less exotic san francisco it remained just as enjoyable dark sinister characters lurking in the rainy night <UNK> fired from open windows that <UNK> miss the hero's head sophisticated and supposed <UNK> alarm systems just begging for someone to test them and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love and mr <UNK> takes a <UNK> got 'em all a couple other <UNK> for me included the always enjoyable lionel <UNK> in a nice little role comic relief from g p <UNK> that's actually funny and a return to form for mr <UNK> i've already mentioned his disguise in the movie's opening scenes well the athletic <UNK> comes out near the film's finale <UNK> is a like a <UNK> <UNK> of activity as he goes after his prey all this and i haven't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre any way you look at it mr <UNK> takes a vacation is a winner br br as much as i hate that the mr <UNK> series had to end after this installment it's understandable when you think about it wwii was just around the corner and after pearl harbor a movie with a japanese hero wouldn't have gone over very well at least the mr <UNK> series ended on a very positive note
<START> zodiac killer 2005 was an interesting film from german born director <UNK> <UNK> he directs produced and co stars in this latest production not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap but he reaches a new low when <UNK> <UNK> works in footage from nearly his entire film <UNK> i have seen film clips from boogeyman i and ii war birds <UNK> of the wolf brain waves and cocaine <UNK> even andy <UNK> makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film even though he uses plenty of old footage he works them in well and very <UNK> might i add br br the film follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer he also <UNK> with a writer <UNK> <UNK> who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies the writer's friend david <UNK> helps him to try and find this wannabe zodiac can this killer be stopped will the writer put two and two together and <UNK> some of his old glory is david <UNK> still the man you'll have to find out for yourself and watch the zodiac killer br br this film is not about the original zodiac killer i have also heard people <UNK> about this film being shot on video so what the director's old school artistic style <UNK> the fact that it's shot on video my only complaint was the over use of stock footage from <UNK> <UNK> earlier films but i understand why <UNK> <UNK> don't believe the hype this is a gritty and street level horror film like the <UNK> in the beginning states this film does nor <UNK> murder you got to like that statement br br highly recommend for <UNK> <UNK> fans
<START> the <UNK> was a different type of film for michael <UNK> although normally associated with action flicks that <UNK> martial arts this film because it was a western <UNK> him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed br br the major problem of course is that the film does not allow any solid character development the <UNK> in is really left to the viewer we can only guess at the sadness that has made the <UNK> whose real name is michael <UNK> the killer that he is a killer mind you that a little town <UNK> by a local bully <UNK> as a hero who can release it from its misery
<START> i'm amazed we see even one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this old film we don't <UNK> get good opera films and here is a true grand opera rendition understandably the visuals are not great it's dated but as opera it can't be <UNK> and i'm an opera buff i can't even <UNK> one lip sync if we didn't know that was <UNK> in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't sophia loren she does everything with flair her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life the rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet <UNK> most of the actors are excellent loren truly marvelous her rival <UNK> is also terrific whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have enjoyed it naturally <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> is the engine behind the scenes i love this old movie
<START> and thats about all that is this thing is slow the actors have ability they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort the plot isn't that great and is <UNK> further by the aforementioned <UNK> of it all the accents when there are any are british uh lots of these folks are supposed to be danes ok ok accents aren't that important but language is i don't think they used words like yeah and ok in <UNK> day and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him did he ever <UNK> that thing did he ever sight it in or was beowulf just that bad an aim well his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in <UNK> the monsters those were rather off too bad special effects bright spot just one that i can think of <UNK> <UNK> has held up well over the years
<START> there's a theory of time that <UNK> that all the moments that ever existed and will exist actually exist right now it's a bit too much to wrap your head around but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place for barbara jean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that time was twenty five years earlier the mid 1930's when her youth and <UNK> held the greatest promise for my part if i could travel through time it would be back to the 1950's when i grew up maybe to a place like <UNK> but that's another episode br br one thing that wouldn't be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky <UNK> just to watch an episode of the twilight zone how many <UNK> do you think it would take to <UNK> the entire series and then find a particular story you wanted to watch i guess you have to consider the trade offs <UNK> versus simplicity having it right now or taking the time to <UNK> it up to the exact spot where the story begins popping in a cd has it's <UNK> br br i'm a little surprised that rod <UNK> would pen a story that so closely <UNK> sunset <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character mirror <UNK> norma <UNK> just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept martin <UNK> portrays very much a similar character to <UNK> von <UNK> the husband turned butler who's loyalty is <UNK> where the story <UNK> has to do with the way danny <UNK> and <UNK> ted de <UNK> challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the <UNK> that <UNK> her existence br br fortunately for us viewers <UNK> <UNK> had no such <UNK> about taking parts that were <UNK> big but a nice <UNK> it's a real treat to watch any episode of the twilight zone and get to see who pops up from days gone by sometimes you get a two <UNK> like you have here with <UNK> and <UNK> celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began and sometimes after combined with the stories that the program produced it's not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today
<START> der <UNK> is not one of my favorite <UNK> <UNK> film but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and <UNK> those looking for a gore fest or exploitation in the style of the <UNK> films or <UNK> will probably be disappointed der <UNK> is definitely an art house style film so those that need linear <UNK> <UNK> need not apply br br the basic concept of der <UNK> is that there is an episode for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide interspersed with scenes of a slowly <UNK> corpse br br there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes including the man talking about the problems with his wife and the concert massacre which unfortunately lost some of it's power on me because i was too busy laughing at the <UNK> look alike band on stage but seriously this is a sometimes beautiful the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge sometimes confusing sometimes silly the she wolf of the ss rip off is pretty amusing sometimes harrowing i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective film that is more of an experience then just entertainment as many of these art films are meant to be still i didn't find der <UNK> to be as strong as <UNK> or <UNK> and would probably put it on relatively even <UNK> with <UNK> 2 in terms of my personally enjoyment level definitely worth a look to any <UNK> or art film fan if you dig this type of film check out <UNK> cruelty in my opinion the best art house horror film that i've seen 7 10 for der <UNK>
<START> the film is a collection of <UNK> on just about anything out there it has no focus whatsoever no goals no real message symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is <UNK> and outrageous this movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy <UNK> dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal where there is no substance to this exchange the actors regardless of how good they are normally can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion aka raising the stakes over acting to put it simply the directing is of no help here nothing can save this non story it is forced <UNK> and boring to tears inaccuracies in <UNK> punk rock with the who <UNK> and flashy 90's outfits characters wander without a role detail and motive locations are <UNK> this is boogie nights <UNK> the good <UNK> <UNK> saturday night fever with meaning and art ripped out br br good <UNK> i'll give it that br br some films have flaws this film is lee's flaw he sold out like the rest of them became irrelevant he has nothing of interest to say anymore br br i have no desire to see anything again from this guy whom i'll <UNK> from <UNK> from now on
<START> very nice action with an <UNK> story which actually doesn't suck interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts having jenna jameson and asia <UNK> helps <UNK> it up too jenna in that <UNK> and those glasses is just astounding worth picking up just to see her
<START> that's right a movie written directed and produced by fred <UNK> and family fred should have known better having worked the sets of <UNK> and <UNK> br br so the plot there are some scientists and some forest rangers and a hot chick with huge fake breasts they are all really bad at their jobs including the hot chick who i think is supposed to be a photographer but who cares because she wears a bikini one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are professional people which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional <UNK> or <UNK> or ewoks br br they are <UNK> through the woods in search of some strange ape like bones and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot they just wander around and one of the rangers <UNK> hits on the <UNK> we all hope he dies real soon along with his sister who's meant to be the cute naive one but is really just annoying then they gasp find a <UNK> i mean ape like animal burial ground of course no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they're messing with i guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types of things br br then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike chases the other losers away and <UNK> his great aunt muriel and cousin josh who died in an unfortunate <UNK> accident all over again br br insipid boring dialogue i <UNK> out several times inane plot unlikable characters bad cgi a man in a monkey suit would look better and acting that just wasn't very good all add up to make a movie i won't be watching again br br you check it out though it's good for some unintentional laughs
<START> probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that i love peter falk one of the world's great <UNK> of bumbling incompetence and yet he is one of the only anchors that <UNK> this from being a chaotic disaster as pops <UNK> he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to chris <UNK> manic <UNK> respectable performances are also offered by richard <UNK> as the <UNK> boss <UNK> shaw as a talented female fbi agent <UNK> her head off a glass ceiling and fred ward as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> arnold br br the plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and in the hands of a young steve martin or chevy chase could have proved a great comedic vehicle <UNK> who seems to <UNK> ernest or pee wee herman just provides a muddled mess sadly peter <UNK> and chris penn who portray his <UNK> brothers both fall far short of their <UNK> <UNK> br br there are some very funny scenes but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones what i truly miss here is what always attracted me to the leslie <UNK> movies there is no <UNK> <UNK> of wit riding over the slapstick no cultural references that only the adults get no double <UNK> it is just silly br br and by the way this doesn't all mean that i am <UNK> it for your 9 year old because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions
<START> one scene demonstrates the mentality of terminator woman pretty well karen <UNK> and another woman are trying to escape from the <UNK> camp karen runs across an armed guard who points his gun at her but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight karen kicks him in the balls picks up the gun and runs away then again when a film is directed by a martial artist and written produced by another member of his family you know you shouldn't expect too much karen <UNK> and jerry <UNK> do get some amusing banter going early on and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love hate relationship but after about 20 minutes they get separated and the film slows to a crawl and even with the occasional fight scene to <UNK> things up it lacks excitement the finale has <UNK> fighting <UNK> inside a cave and <UNK> going <UNK> a <UNK> against the beautiful ashley hayden on a <UNK> but the fights are <UNK> in a way that breaks their flow and <UNK> their value on the positive side kudos to the <UNK> department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular <UNK> throughout the film 1 2
<START> pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films it's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second by <UNK> on the guys who <UNK> the cube it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube as we simply don't care about the characters inside much of the film is simply boring and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass eyed superior and the green eyed crazy marine after that though it just <UNK> into over the top unintentional hilarity the ending is fitting though <UNK> it back into the first one in an <UNK> way the script is terrible the acting mediocre at best and the direction unimpressive a much lesser follow up
<START> for all the <UNK> respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians it still lacks <UNK> in a couple critical areas action and fight scenes but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i've ever seen in a martial arts film five deadly <UNK> without a doubt is a must see not only that a movie you can watch again and again but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better it somehow leaves you wanting something you want more the producer chang <UNK> sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential <UNK> but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer <UNK> snake <UNK> lizard <UNK> and they are shown but battles are <UNK> short the <UNK> and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been <UNK> much much more in fact the <UNK> is killed off by the middle of the movie interestingly enough with this movie the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang <UNK> takes us to a <UNK> <UNK> the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem <UNK> and somehow you expected more still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not <UNK> in detail sad thing is the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his <UNK> and didn't expand on it i am left wondering what could have been with this movie still one of the best though 8 out of 10 on the scale
<START> i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently the sci fi channel has run worse but not by much a shameless ripoff of jurassic park attack <UNK> <UNK> cats for dinosaurs and they are on the loose <UNK> as many extras as possible the cgi is pretty bad and closeups of <UNK> cat heads are laughable we get some gore which helps a little wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it other than robert carradine who has very little to do the cast is unknown apparently this was shot in <UNK> nice work if you can get it reminds me of all those low budget monster <UNK> that were popular in the 80s and 90s
<START> the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called <UNK> <UNK> owned run by guy johnson andrew parker lead singer dylan sean cook guitar player mike jason <UNK> plan to tell the other band members bass player london brooke <UNK> drummer nancy tom <UNK> that they are both going solo their services won't be needed any longer once at the club dylan <UNK> but mike doesn't show up the gig turns into a disaster then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the <UNK> that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one by one br br produced directed by juan a <UNK> the choke is a standard by the numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it the script by jessica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not too many horror films out there penned by ladies has some surprisingly good character's in it some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used from the isolated location the victims can't escape from the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up a few murders a really poor twist ending that tries to <UNK> something like scream 1996 be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it <UNK> they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on even though i don't want to <UNK> i was spot on then there's the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious the kill count is low at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up go their separate ways bad idea when there's a killer on the loose the pace is <UNK> the kill scenes are unimaginative to top it all off the twist ending is poor br br director <UNK> does alright the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping the gore levels aren't really up to scratch there's some blood splatter a guy with a hole in his chest a few dead bodies someone <UNK> on some metal <UNK> most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock <UNK> soundtrack with some truly horrible horrible rock songs used on it i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise <UNK> it's not scary there's no real atmosphere the lack of blood gore is just <UNK> when the rest of the film is so bad br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look shot in a place called <UNK> in washington apparently the acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round i mean no one is going to win an oscar but it ain't half bad br br the choke is a <UNK> routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever a criminal lack of blood gore violence nudity dead bodies i mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for right
<START> let me start by stating that i usually do like <UNK> <UNK> directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be <UNK> for some the shots unlike <UNK> elm street 4 and die hard 2 which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold <UNK> for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i don't even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it's almost like <UNK> thought that if they <UNK> down the words being said they could improve the script wrong again br br the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around <UNK> turner and the worst of the bunch <UNK> there is something wrong with this picture <UNK> played one of the best villains in <UNK> yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here how is that possible i've always been a huge fan of his and he gets <UNK> in acting by stallone who himself still <UNK> in his performance <UNK> part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael <UNK> can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when <UNK> and <UNK> have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurred br br which brings me back to <UNK> who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it's his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i don't care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting br br plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the <UNK> and <UNK> of the plane scene but i really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guy's would have won early maybe i wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever
<START> i cannot believe how popular this show is i consider myself an avid sci fi fan i have read countless sci fi novels and have enjoyed many sci fi movies and tv shows i really wouldn't even consider this true sci fi every episode i have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting br br it's basically a bunch of people standing around in army <UNK> talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional <UNK> and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous <UNK> in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sad br br the movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with a <UNK> through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination i actually thought the tv series alien nation from a few years back based on the movie alien nation was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters i wasn't crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was great br br also unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet <UNK> special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate
<START> ok i've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird this movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad orson wells playing the staring role couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a <UNK> he just did not belong in this movie at all but anyhow the <UNK> takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a <UNK> the lady that had the <UNK> and her husband go off to a place called <UNK> on <UNK> and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die the couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes <UNK> and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly <UNK> that was creepy as well as seeing the little boy <UNK> to orson wells at the <UNK> that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life the lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself <UNK> by it's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about this movie is ok it's has it's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have orson in there
<START> don't waste your time on this film it could have been good but the ending was one of the <UNK> i've ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought yeah now there's an ending and <UNK> themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole build up fall flat on it's face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously i'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say wtf
<START> a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end the late walter matthau is the <UNK> ex comedian who is <UNK> to join together with his ex partner the late oscar winner george burns for a final reunion show on stage br br benjamin martin is <UNK> agent and nephew and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns i love <UNK> grumpy character he's just the same as he always is and yet also very different br br burns as the absent minded old man is just as funny as matthau br br matthau want some <UNK> i've got <UNK> <UNK> and graham br br burns how about a plain cracker br br matthau i don't got plain i got <UNK> <UNK> and graham br br burns okay br br matthau they're in the <UNK> in the kitchen br br burns maybe later br br or how about this br br matthau when i did black the whites knew what i was saying br br you've got to see it in the movie to understand it br br all in all a <UNK> hilarious sweet heartfelt warm <UNK> character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time br br they just don't make them like this anymore in a time when all the <UNK> comedies are crude juvenile and stupid this <UNK> back towards the tender core of what comedy really is funny characters smart and funny dialogue and grand entertainment br br one of the best buddy comedies of all time right up there with planes trains and <UNK> lethal weapon and the hard way br br you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv but trust me it will be worth your time br br 4 5 5 stars br br john <UNK>
<START> in my opinion this movie's title should be changed from only the brave to all about lane i went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome although i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of <UNK> a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry the acting in some parts of film was quite stale the performances of marc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jason scott lee were all great however the director should have never put himself as the main character in the movie sorry lane you are just not a film actor stick to what you're good at theater acting gina <UNK> performance in this film was also horrible she should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were <UNK> to play the part of a miss <UNK> queen there were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful why weren't they cast for that role another major problem with this film were its action sequences the japanese american soldiers don't look like they were fighting german soldiers let alone anyone granted this was a low budget feature but since this was a war based film isn't it important to show some actually fighting this film was a worthy attempt but definitely not worth a major distribution
<START> when i'd seen the name of this movie i'd always thought it was a musical like the harvey girls it's not it's a <UNK> that <UNK> hit the kitchen ceiling and was <UNK> off and <UNK> together no music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable br br it starts with <UNK> james woods telling the <UNK> of his three daughters a small child who grows to be barbara stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home br br we thus think it is going to be a historical <UNK> tale and it is for a brief time then it turns into the story of cold hearted <UNK> fight against lawyer george brent why is she so dead set against him well why else as we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by stanwyck she had once thought she could <UNK> some money for her sisters as well as herself of course by marrying she hit on someone she took to be a country <UNK> who was in fact budding lawyer brent br br <UNK> anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is well you know they had a <UNK> marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived br br one of her sisters is in love with a painter named gig young who is played by gig young the other sister tries to take him away etc etc br br it is a shrill <UNK> mess well enough acted but without a shred of logic or <UNK>
<START> first of all the release date is 2009 not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film it should be more properly referred to as earth 2009 secondly allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the planet earth tv series of 2006 br br i have not seen this tv series but learned here that this film is the full length version of this 2006 tv series i judge any film on it's own merits not by it's source i judge the results on their own and the results of earth 2009 are indeed excellent i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers that it's simply an expanded version of the 2006 tv series planet earth so what it doesn't really matter br br as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime i was <UNK> and highly impressed by earth 2009 this is the debut film from the new <UNK> division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney's <UNK> and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 1950's and 1960's br br cinematography film editing music score sound and narration are all excellent there have been a few other nature documentaries that also <UNK> in these categories what really sets earth 2009 apart is its' scope it literally covers the entire planet covering all seven <UNK> br br after my first viewing it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create br br three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film br br earth 2009 convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great <UNK> as it <UNK> one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december from the north pole to the south pole br br two special new high tech cameras were used for this film one camera has a <UNK> degree computer controlled <UNK> <UNK> lens and the other is a <UNK> camera set to an amazing 1 000 frames per second this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth 2009 especially the <UNK> chase and great white sharks <UNK> out of the water to catch sea lions and an <UNK> view going over the edge of the world's highest <UNK> there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary br br via cinematography music score and narration there is drama sadness humor and great beauty in this documentary with a great music score performed by the world renowned <UNK> <UNK> excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration i consider earth 2009 as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made br br five years of hard work patience talent and dedication really paid off very well here this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world i predict an academy award for best documentary feature among other awards truly an amazing astonishing <UNK> and magnificent documentary film br br very highly recommended
<START> spoiler alert  although i think this one was spoiled coming out of the <UNK> it's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars from this studio made at this time period could be so awful but it is it is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense br br rich widower american aristocrat penn <UNK> leaves his small daughter in charge and goes off to world war i where he is killed then we flash forward to present day 1942 and total confusion the three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years and some jerk named <UNK> is trying to take their home away from them this is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that <UNK> the script more holes in it than the warren report what happened to the <UNK> fortune if the will is worth half a billion why has the family home gone from an <UNK> palace to the house on the <UNK> who the devil is this <UNK> clown and why is he able to take someone's home away from them the questions just pile on top of more questions br br the usually <UNK> and charming george brent is playing <UNK> who is inexplicably a total <UNK> <UNK> all over everyone taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a <UNK> of guilt yet no one besides <UNK> barbara <UNK> seems to particularly dislike this <UNK> why none of these questions are ever answered we instead just follow <UNK> life from one train wreck to another the evil <UNK> takes away her home her fortune and even her child what does she do shoot him set him on fire no too logical in a completely <UNK> wrap up this woman who's only prior romantic involvement with <UNK> was save for the <UNK> of marriage rape suddenly decides mid sentence literally that she does not hate him she loves him and they're going to live happily ever after all of a sudden for no reason in the world this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more <UNK> found in films of this era yeah sure steal everything in the world that belongs to me and i'll fall in love with you on what planet does that happen i can only guess the reason i never heard of this film before i happened to catch it on turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today

<START> as far as i know this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s early '70s and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wiped br br series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety and i recently got the chance to watch it all the best part of 4 decades on br br after <UNK> home from school <UNK> was essential viewing for me and many of my <UNK> back in those <UNK> days of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> tip and watching it again brought a nostalgic <UNK> to the throat br br never mind the bad hammy acting the unintentionally amusing fight scenes plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean going <UNK> through and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accents of the lead players br br no forget all that because <UNK> <UNK> back to a <UNK> dare i say golden age of kids' tv drama when the shows were simply about rip roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously before they became obsessed with all the angst laden <UNK> that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists <UNK> over such as relationships <UNK> drugs <UNK> etc br br no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of all <UNK> political correctness the boss figure would be a black female one of the young male heroes would be a muslim the other would be a white <UNK> confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all action go <UNK> with an iq off the scale who'd be forever getting the <UNK> out of <UNK> and making them look foolish in other words a million miles removed from wendy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> upper br br it's a show that's very much of its time but is that a bad thing i for one don't think so

<START> the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story <UNK> itself almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film alexander <UNK> nearly went broke making this film br br according to the <UNK> film series book about the great british films adopted son of the united kingdom alexander <UNK> had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and <UNK> but world war ii unfortunately caught up with <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> of filming a grand spectacle br br budget costs happen in us films too only cecil b demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there but demille nor any of his american <UNK> had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film part of the way through the shoot <UNK> transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex <UNK> as the genie in our grand canyon he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk <UNK> also finished the interiors in hollywood all in time for a release on christmas day 1940 br br the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography best art set direction for a color film and best special effects only <UNK> <UNK> original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category <UNK> must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place br br the special effects however do not <UNK> the simple story of good <UNK> over evil the good is the two young lovers john justin and june <UNK> and the evil is conrad <UNK> as the <UNK> who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart both <UNK> to <UNK> this was <UNK> career role until casablanca where he played the <UNK> major <UNK> br br of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source <UNK> boy and thief <UNK> who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the <UNK> of <UNK> he was spotted by alexander <UNK> who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features <UNK> captures all the innocence and <UNK> of youth as he <UNK> the <UNK> nights fantasy of the boy who <UNK> a <UNK> not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that br br the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today it's an eternal tale of love romance and adventure in any order you want to put it
<START> go way back to page ten of this review section and work your way back up go ahead i'll wait br br done well then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have you could <UNK> all day long about the lame jokes dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and <UNK> in <UNK> but this movie seems to be one of those <UNK> me now love me later flicks br br bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original <UNK> to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion that worked fine for the original but obviously bombed in 1991 when no self <UNK> <UNK> would be caught dead wearing anything but <UNK> or <UNK> he liked anything about the 80's as ted would put it dude this is a totally deep hole wanna play 20 questions br br they say nostalgia goes in 20 year <UNK> and that certainly seems to be the case here here in <UNK> those of use who grew up with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that like it or not made us who we are if you're one of those who look at <UNK> as if it were an outdated <UNK> <UNK> ripoff then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair wearing <UNK> and looking like you just <UNK> out of bed br br in self <UNK> its own origins the star trek episode and and time traveling with a phone booth b t makes no attempt to hide its <UNK> love for homage quentin tarantino anyone i'm not saying <UNK> is <UNK> love ' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snap shot of our society at a time before child psychology <UNK> anti smoking ads terrorist paranoia and the <UNK> of media fear <UNK> br br so for all of you b t <UNK> out there turn off your screaming trees cd get that hair out of your face go to the beach and <UNK> up <UNK> depression and intellectual <UNK> are so corporate
<START> some amusing humor some that falls flat some decent acting some that is quite atrocious this movie is simply hit and miss guaranteed to <UNK> 12 year old boys more than any other <UNK> br br the child actors in the movie are just unfunny when you are making a family comedy that does tend to be a problem beverly <UNK> rises above the material to give a funny and dare i say it human performance in the midst of this mediocrity
<START> many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast <UNK> of hanks <UNK> out there that tom did in fact make crappy films i think bachelor party was great but that's another story the movie focuses on a <UNK> and dragons style game that eventually drives our young <UNK> to <UNK> madness the story is <UNK> early 1980s focusing as it does on the <UNK> threat to our youth <UNK> by those evil role playing games br br i however prefer to view <UNK> and monsters as the turning point in the whatever happened to chris <UNK> story we all remember him as <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> and as the hapless <UNK> in my bodyguard where he gave us all a <UNK> thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon few could argue especially those of us who read dynamite on a regular basis that great things were in store for him br br and then came <UNK> <UNK> the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault <UNK> performance in this is all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was <UNK> and that was 1986 he had a small role as sean <UNK> brother in <UNK> and the snowman but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with <UNK> hair and <UNK> <UNK> br br i can't in good conscience recommend this movie watch it if only to see a younger more idealistic chris <UNK> before <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on his soul
<START> <UNK> letter <UNK> is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian <UNK> service struggling to <UNK> their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the <UNK> between the characters' past <UNK> and present <UNK> are clumsily and over <UNK> represented what's most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title there's no <UNK> whatsoever and it's quite impossible to <UNK> what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it's a shame as the film's overall tone is poignant and <UNK> and there's some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else
<START> star trek hidden frontier is a long running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they're green <UNK> it this doesn't take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a whole i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9
<START> this movie pleasantly surprised me it has a touching slightly off center approach that never loses your attention this is a movie i never heard about but if you want a sleeper this is it great writing production and acting i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful nick nolte <UNK> lee and alan arkin are marvelous why wasn't more made of this movie
<START> i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
<START> he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was i can't believe that steven <UNK> career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with <UNK> rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him <UNK> the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single <UNK> chop between the shoulder <UNK> to take out an <UNK> and the guy falls like a ton of <UNK> something is wrong br br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book br br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under <UNK> he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all br br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the <UNK> in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have <UNK> over time the <UNK> film showing president john f kennedy being <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> br br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the <UNK> man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must <UNK> br br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no <UNK> theater owner would play this movie
<START> this movie has been made by one of the most absurd <UNK> in canada <UNK> p <UNK> i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy but knowing he was a heavy <UNK> was seen in every local festival and in the local <UNK> i had a positive feeling about this movie br br hell i was right right off the bat the scenario written by <UNK> himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in <UNK> fashion it's a one of a kind 90 minutes jack in the box br br loosely inspired and mostly transformed <UNK> to dangerous <UNK> by <UNK> les <UNK> consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the <UNK> throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who's who and who's writing to who on that <UNK> <UNK> which pops up in an interesting love affair br br great storyline great photography great <UNK> of other movies should we ask more for a first movie
<START> who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people when <UNK> confronts his <UNK> wife in the dressing room the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog so one can hear neither <UNK> any emotional impact the scene may have had the scenes of <UNK> getting beaten by her father with his <UNK> a <UNK> and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd this entire movie is a cartoon the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding the discussion by the black women after <UNK> wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman as if it were a discussion by an <UNK> <UNK> team is ridiculous the rampant racism might be possible to endure but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this <UNK> is too much it was a technically poorly made movie there is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making the sound track the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie <UNK> i actually felt sorry for anthony quinn wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick his appearance in this is painful this is the first movie i have seen by this director and it will be my last
<START> funny that i find myself forced to review this movie but here i am br br i am reviewing it because just recently i have had the chance to witness the revival of r c <UNK> play <UNK> end on stage in new york at the <UNK> theatre starring hugh <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and others as well as being masterfully directed by david <UNK> br br i left the theater <UNK> i am not <UNK> i was <UNK> after almost two and a half hours of a <UNK> and very claustrophobic depiction of <UNK> life in the <UNK> of the <UNK> i <UNK> during world war one brought to life vividly by everyone involved i came out of the theater with the shakes br br mind you i am not easily shocked nor am i too sensitive i am a stage actor and a director myself so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects both emotionally as well as psychologically br br but what i had just witnessed came so much to life that i had chills in my spine as i left br br none of these emotions came to life while watching <UNK> high the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen in <UNK> with r c sheriff himself shortly before he died br br the screen adaptation takes place in the <UNK> over france so gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with br br the only plus of the movie are the <UNK> battle scenes which look dated in their special effects compared to today's standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen br br granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of all quiet on the western front by <UNK> maria <UNK> which takes place in <UNK> and not in the sky but that was the german vision on things if one would like to be <UNK> on such things br br <UNK> end is just the other side of the <UNK> and would have made it into a great movie if they had left it alone and intact br br the transfer on dvd is poor even though in widescreen and adapted for 16 9 tv screens the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater nothing more nothing less it sports various <UNK> such as minor <UNK> and <UNK> although the copy for the rest is clean br br if you want another wwi movie in your collection especially for those who love and enjoy to see <UNK> battles among old <UNK> then this is a picture for you but i rather would suggest von <UNK> and brown as an alternative although that too is a movie filled with inaccuracies br br for the rest of you who love good acting and drama i would leave this one out buy the play go watch the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you but keep off this would be adaptation br br it is an anti war movie granted but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime ever br br the presence of actors such as <UNK> howard ray <UNK> richard johnson and john gielgud is just a <UNK> since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie br br mcdowell the very talented christopher plummer simon ward and peter <UNK> all deliver very weak performances not due to their lack of skills but rather due to lack of true and solid direction br br there are too many gaps in it and as said before it drags itself to the dubious end dubious because in the original play none of the men we come to know and sympathize with stay alive they are all killed in a fatal and <UNK> mission in the movie they all die except malcolm mcdowell who manages somehow to stay alive another day being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause br br the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness you just hear the <UNK> <UNK> the machine guns <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> throughout the theater then suddenly total peace and silence the curtain comes up lights and here they all are <UNK> up standing straight and rigid <UNK> corpses br br far more interesting and far more shocking than <UNK> high finale which is also dragged by the hair br br it is up to you to judge br br for me if i had the money and the contacts to do so i would take the play and develop it the way it was meant adding here and there some action scene in the field just to <UNK> the outer horror and slaughter going on in the <UNK> fields of france around the men involved but then just strictly <UNK> on what is going on in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the world br br want such a movie br br then ask for it br br this is not it
<START> early hollywood at it's best a classic <UNK> poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and admit it you do too
<START> in new york when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm matt <UNK> luke wilson meets jenny johnson uma thurman in the subway he invites her to date and have dinner with him jenny immediately falls in love for him they have sex and she <UNK> her true identity to him telling that she is the powerful superhero g girl after meeting his co worker and friend hannah lewis anna <UNK> the <UNK> jenny becomes jealous controlling and manipulative and matt follows the advice of his best friend vaughn <UNK> <UNK> wilson and <UNK> her breaking her heart jenny turns <UNK> life into hell while he has a romance with hannah however the <UNK> of g girl and former high school sweetheart of jenny professor <UNK> eddie izzard <UNK> matt to lure jenny to strip her <UNK> br br my super ex girlfriend is delightfully silly and funny this romantic comedy adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot anna <UNK> is extremely sexy as usual and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in fatal attraction or evelyn <UNK> in play misty for me my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> super ex <UNK> my super ex girlfriend
<START> i would just like to state that this may be biased as i am a producer on the film however i will maintain some sense of dignity br br the star of the film oscar <UNK> gives a stellar performance as jeff <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> who spends more time worrying than living he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy his mother played by christine <UNK> is the constant support <UNK> that without he would <UNK> upon himself his friends also lend a hand in <UNK> life often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will which often times he <UNK> is there anyway br br the writing is superb and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie with half as much ben affleck boo <UNK> <UNK> br br the camera work is a little shoddy at some points and the sound could also use a boost however the performances out shine the minor details it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer br br all in all this was a treat a rare gem among many <UNK>
<START> this movie is far better than the original the jerk i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor we have <UNK> almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime <UNK> as we have from monty python br br the card game with the <UNK> and then with mr suicide the scene at the dinner table and his <UNK> for turtle soup the original the jerk was too choreographed <UNK> staged while i like steve martin he seemed like he was trying to hard the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk
<START> this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark it's writing is lazy absurd self indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like <UNK> and <UNK> br br it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun pirates of the <UNK> the mummy count of <UNK> <UNK> all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing i've ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate i've ever seen it's absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement br br makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
<START> simon's carefully written dialogues are truly <UNK> by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script <UNK> there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot <UNK> with less quality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar <UNK> in the odd couple and with all of the little <UNK> and mannerisms that matthau <UNK> into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances i've ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray <UNK> simon's superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate must sees and does demand a <UNK> <UNK> place in the pages of film history
<START> fascinating movie based on a true story about an australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused of killing her baby daughter she insists that a <UNK> took her baby but the story is highly suspicious the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way <UNK> interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction based on barely any hard evidence i love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are <UNK> by the justice system i've always thought that <UNK> ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties it's not as has often been said a liberal movie but a <UNK> look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge a cry in the dark is likewise <UNK> <UNK> is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic some may find the film boring or dry but i found it engaging
<START> i don't know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this in fact it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way <UNK> <UNK> did br br the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time one connected to the other the football match and the battle between <UNK> that's going on behind the walls of the stadium br br it makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters and while watching the movie as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie it's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending you will want to find out the verdict you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls br br i like the <UNK> conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military <UNK> it's like <UNK> vs mars it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very <UNK> society like iran br br this is the second movie of <UNK> <UNK> that i have seen the first being <UNK> gold and am looking forward to watching some more br br am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a must see
<START> wow who ever said that edward d wood jr never influenced anybody this steaming pile of <UNK> <UNK> is a perfect case in point it makes the violent years look like casablanca santa claus also makes keith <UNK> worst flashbacks look like my first <UNK> <UNK> i've had nightmares you know waking up and <UNK> bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus <UNK> from the seemingly pure <UNK> of my very being however i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well also if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa satan <UNK> on vhs tape look no further don't check out this movie as i've been <UNK> the mst3k version is now available move over satan here's santa claus
<START> you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to <UNK> which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night <UNK> despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period br br this is a very chilling story even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony <UNK> johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually <UNK> aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed <UNK> in my mind br br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately <UNK> caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it's this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it's scary too br br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be <UNK> though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end
<START> the american <UNK> association which is the source of the familiar <UNK> no animals were <UNK> the <UNK> trademark of the <UNK> began to <UNK> the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after a <UNK> horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james 1939 needless to say the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me i suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the <UNK> and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making but i can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken
<START> the tenant is roman <UNK> greatest film imo and i love <UNK> but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy it's also a great black comedy some people i have shown this film to have been very disturbed by it afterwards so be <UNK> it does affect some people that way polanski does a great job acting the lead role in the tenant as well as directing it
<START> i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was <UNK> the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of <UNK> in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage however she must be positively <UNK> for her heroic effort true <UNK> can't say the same for her co star <UNK> with her whining voice that <UNK> on your nervous system appeared <UNK> gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from <UNK> performance it is indeed utter trash
<START> waiting to go inside the <UNK> with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting sci fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my <UNK> of movies regarding robot technology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also <UNK> me will smith didn't show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to <UNK> since than not spoiling his name with titles like i robot and men in black 2 4 10
<START> most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets the set designer used a lot of beautiful art <UNK> <UNK> along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth it is worth paying attention to the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich all the gangster actors were cast it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way this is a film <UNK> film it was made by people for people who love the medium don't miss this one
<START> stargate sg 1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is <UNK> a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team br br the main bad guys are called the <UNK> they are <UNK> who can get inserted into one's brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any <UNK> who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the <UNK> are called <UNK> who house the <UNK> <UNK> in their bodies until the <UNK> can get inserted in a person's brain br br through the episodes we mostly get to see sg 1 the <UNK> team comprised of jack daniel <UNK> and sam go through the <UNK> that instantly <UNK> them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with <UNK> issues on earth br br through the years you start to see a decline in the sg 1 team as close <UNK> and more character building story lines this in turn means even more on world episodes which is perfectly understandable br br my rating 8 75 10 while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction
<START> one of the worst romantic comedies <UNK> worst movies i've ever seen boy who works as a phone psychic must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams hilarity does not ensue boredom light gay bashing and horrible dialogue do if you read brad <UNK> and like his crappy dialogue you'll like this movie br br be smart avoid this if you see it destroy the copy
<START> when a film has no fewer than five different titles it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere <UNK> has major flaws and is just out and out bad i saw the version on video called rosemary's <UNK> yes i am sure it <UNK> from other versions but i am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have going to be really any better the story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for <UNK> yep it gets bad this early the town is called <UNK> and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in soon we find that everyone living in <UNK> is a witch and all follow the <UNK> of mr <UNK> the head of this <UNK> <UNK> who wants his dead son back hence the name <UNK> the people in the town do witch kind of stuff have <UNK> some like wearing a <UNK> head and <UNK> <UNK> not much really shown in this area but none of these people are very good actors mr <UNK> is played <UNK> by the <UNK> and literally larger than life movie maverick orson welles welles is <UNK> but make no mistake he is the best thing in this movie and that is really the saddest part of <UNK> as welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial <UNK> in one scene at a party director bert i gordon keeps going back to welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames it looked ridiculous as did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman's arm centered in <UNK> flames after a car crash it looked like the arm of a shop <UNK> the story is never fully <UNK> as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed this also applies to the corny hokey ending the lead pamela franklin is <UNK> and pretty and has some talent other than her performance real slim <UNK> from the rest of the cast sans welles the direction and story were both done by gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine this is not a good movie in any way under any name
<START> edward <UNK> is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least <UNK> objects imaginable everyday items such as <UNK> boxes metal <UNK> etc items which most of us perceive as <UNK> at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit are instead converted into glorious objects <UNK> by <UNK> camera he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and <UNK> <UNK> that are apparently ever present in the <UNK> world for those <UNK> enough to spot them that is even <UNK> of <UNK> trash can become objects of beauty when seen through <UNK> lens but didn't we already know that from wall e he is particularly interested in <UNK> areas like mines and <UNK> where man has already made <UNK> into nature which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures i e the workers in those places with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape br br <UNK> landscapes a documentary about <UNK> work has much of the feel of a <UNK> about it as it <UNK> us with its richly <UNK> <UNK> of images and <UNK> indeed director jennifer <UNK> and cinematographer peter <UNK> capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records <UNK> and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china a <UNK> in <UNK> and the construction site at the massive three rivers <UNK> <UNK> project in china with their fluid camera work the filmmakers match point for point the beauty of <UNK> images in fact the movie opens with a stunning eight minute long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers <UNK> away in perfectly <UNK> and color <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie does less well when <UNK> gets around to <UNK> the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused <UNK> and decidedly half baked at best but it is as a purely aesthetic experience <UNK> image and form that <UNK> landscapes <UNK> most in the case of <UNK> perhaps a picture really is worth a thousand words
<START> a masterful treatment of james <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice as <UNK> <UNK> first film shot primarily around <UNK> in a soulless war torn italy the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo <UNK> work today a <UNK> handsome <UNK> <UNK> and clara <UNK> who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena <UNK> <UNK> 1941 star as the <UNK> charged and ill <UNK> lovers who plot to kill her husband unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime excellent direction script acting and cinematography reportedly not as good as the french le <UNK> <UNK> 1939 but probably better than the us version 1946 featuring <UNK> turner and john garfield in the lead roles highly recommended
<START> 1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames <UNK> the <UNK> wasn't a contemporary of <UNK> <UNK> cultures nor were the <UNK> contemporary to the <UNK> <UNK> speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english except for the <UNK> they do not use which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french br br 2 cultural differences can't be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start <UNK> people around like they are their <UNK> leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and <UNK> them of witchcraft and the like br br 3 historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or <UNK> culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of <UNK> or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with <UNK> and claim to look the part a small town theater group probably has better props br br 4 boring another lame <UNK> production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci fi show otherwise i would shut it of and <UNK> my computer of this <UNK> after the first five minutes
<START> emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane <UNK> classic novel i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better ewan <UNK> who has also been better but he is still very good here alan <UNK> who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and jeremy northam who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching
<START> you must be kidding let's entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress and not just some entry in the <UNK> of the month club of actors really unless this is meant to be a tongue in cheek satire on david mamet <UNK> confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun <UNK> or <UNK> think ben <UNK> <UNK> or a flat out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten <UNK> award or worse br br as if the stiff and uncomfortable posey weren't enough we've got the <UNK> and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum there's more wood in this film than a <UNK> factory br br adding to this already bizarre casting are several other roles all populated by forgettable actors who look or sound like <UNK> from america's next top model don <UNK> or even the kid who <UNK> the word been like bean which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film we are <UNK> his accent to guess if he's canadian or not i think i laughed <UNK> in places that are supposed to be serious and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of <UNK> <UNK> music for <UNK> the house of games if taken as a spoof the film is almost <UNK> if taken seriously just a self conscious piece of <UNK>
<START> in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe <UNK> ian <UNK> his colleagues and friends recall how <UNK> he was while seeking for a scoop meanwhile the deceased joe <UNK> the identity of the <UNK> card serial killer of london he <UNK> the <UNK> and appears to the american student of <UNK> sondra <UNK> scarlett johansson who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician sidney <UNK> woody allen in london and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter <UNK> hugh jackman sondra drags sid in her investigation seeking for <UNK> that peter is the killer however she falls in love with him and questions if joe <UNK> is right in his scoop br br scoop is another great woody allen's comedy outside manhattan actually again in london his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and i laughed a lot <UNK> with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side sid <UNK> is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian however his present <UNK> scarlett johansson of whom i am a big fan has over acting and is annoying in many moments changing <UNK> her accent to a <UNK> <UNK> her character is absolutely silly and <UNK> and i was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment my vote is eight br br title brazil scoop  o <UNK> <UNK> scoop  the big scoop
<START> a surprisingly interesting <UNK> on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only <UNK> minutes but it works the scares are very subtle not the jump cut scares that seem to <UNK> most recent asian horror films the way the scares are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in the <UNK> aka 4 <UNK> <UNK> directed by <UNK> leon lee but this isn't nearly to the same caliber the film does a nice job of <UNK> a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological it's not perfect but it does what it's supposed to do i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance
<START> this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious but it was pretty bad the acting actually was pretty good jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist which is sort of his <UNK> if you don't know such things d bill forsythe well i'm not exactly sure why he was in this film he's way too good for this kinda stuff and his role wasn't exactly demanding i rented this on the strength of those two leads and i wasn't really disappointed i mean heck it's a movie about a half man half shark it ain't shakespeare folks other than the plot which is full of holes and the poor dialogue i would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired there were shots were they were trying to look cool but it ended up <UNK> the scene or just coming off plain <UNK> they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away <UNK> before the person could even deliver the line it was pretty bad but if you are a jeffrey combs fan this one is worth checking out he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character forsythe ain't bad either and either is the female lead heck if i can remember her name though bottom line i wouldn't otherwise waste your time
<START> i'll admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel br br i was let down sure the special effects were technically amazing but they weren't believable looking it looked more like a cartoon alright i admit to liking 80 of the chase scene but the fight with all the mr <UNK> it was too obviously animated br br i can accept all of that what i can't accept is that the non action parts were crap every time <UNK> opened his mouth i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and <UNK> nothing br br i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie except about the existence of the matrix this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream br br ugh i want my 7 00 back
<START> <UNK> you big <UNK> br br this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible <UNK> the toilet is <UNK> by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like <UNK> i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the drivel br br scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made
<START> the over <UNK> plot of <UNK> <UNK> is taken from a juvenile first novel by <UNK> <UNK> which became a best <UNK> though god knows why for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step parent it may have a certain appeal don't be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step mother in <UNK> unfortunately too much rests on the <UNK> shoulders of jean <UNK> she's beautiful and easily <UNK> the image of a spoiled teenager the problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto <UNK> st joan <UNK> first film knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film this movie also by preminger <UNK> the promise of the first it was her second movie she was now 20 what was preminger thinking that niven and kerr could compensate for <UNK> lack of acting capacity not a chance <UNK> character is at the center of the story and pretty though she is convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old she can't meet the emotional demands of the role i don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check in spite of niven and kerr this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons
<START> before nicholas cage was a big action star he was a great actor this lesser known movie is where cage gives one of his best performances red rock west was a low budget almost un known film but is one of my favorite movies of all time i discovered it walking down the video store <UNK> and wanted to see cage and hopper who also is great in the movie appear together go get this one and i'm sure you won't be disappointed
<START> about halfway through i realized i didn't care about these characters in the least however i watched a bit more anyway <UNK> i came back the next day and finished it i shouldn't have bothered br br if you know anything about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it that was almost as bad as snakes on a plane another bad <UNK> catastrophe flick br br i realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less <UNK> than today but even by those standards the acting was embarrassing these weren't characters they were stereotypes i suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by bette davis to help her husband's gary <UNK> career to no <UNK> however i have seen <UNK> trees display more genuine emotion than he did br br <UNK> playing the happy <UNK> i e a non glamorous role was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move it wasn't it was just boring she was a kind of tiny tim in the film making <UNK> <UNK> character see the truth about love and forgiveness although she was less <UNK> than tiny tim <UNK> <UNK> wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died br br the final scene where <UNK> calls his wife back in <UNK> to <UNK> was so affected and over acted on both ends of the phone line i almost <UNK> i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film br br i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie if you found it uplifting that's great but frankly i just found it bad there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted
<START> in his directorial debut denzel washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from <UNK> acting efforts but now we see this touch as a director br br recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection this story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible <UNK> but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end br br we can <UNK> pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be understated br br if the academy <UNK> this film it will be travesty this film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a <UNK> that usually doesn't <UNK> from a novel to the screen this of course is a tribute to the director br br this is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too
<START> this is one of the finest music <UNK> anyone will ever see and hear i grew up when all my <UNK> was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p <UNK> power to <UNK> any crowd of any age this <UNK> goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the <UNK> i saw this guy live in aussie 1975 and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago i have a huge 5 1 surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today singer <UNK> lead rhythm bass guitar piano <UNK> just pure genius there are few <UNK> who can stand alone with one <UNK> and hold the crowd in his hand if you want note perfect music buy a studio recorded cd if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd this dvd is for you
<START> rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly un hollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldn't find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more <UNK> than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me what can i say this may click with you it may not for me it's time i can't get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned there's several real reasons why this is <UNK> and rosario please you're a better actress pick better scripts
<START> me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so but they let us anyways and i love it i can't find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about i'm glad to see that i'm not the only one that loved this movie i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere i would love to watch this now just <UNK> i loved it so much as a little kid and i'm 15 now i remember so much about it thats where i got the little bunny <UNK> song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie i think the little girl got there by <UNK> down the slide on her little <UNK> thing
<START> the small california town of <UNK> is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez <UNK> an ancient box legend has it that the box holds the <UNK> century mexican demon named <UNK> fbi agent <UNK> vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the <UNK> daughters <UNK> and mary to fight with evil and <UNK> demon the legend of <UNK> is an absolute garbage the film lacks scares and gore the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed i'm a big fan of indie horror flicks for example i loved <UNK> live feed bone sickness or neighborhood watch unfortunately the legend of <UNK> is a huge misfire definitely one to avoid
<START> a good cast is <UNK> wasted in this slower than <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> comedy peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a <UNK> bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable regardless of the <UNK> comments here this film is awful badly directed badly edited badly acted badly written you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad br br the muddled and excruciatingly <UNK> plot concerns ustinov <UNK> his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and <UNK> millions of pounds how he does it is beyond <UNK> and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some <UNK> and <UNK> computer expert robert <UNK> into going to south america and stealing his identity br br as a side plot ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob <UNK> that go nowhere while ustinov goes about <UNK> the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of <UNK> and karl malden then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil which has become the <UNK> finale of almost every british caper comedy since nuns on the run a fish called <UNK> br br the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this even a cameo by <UNK> romero didn't help it one of the most unfunny poorly paced <UNK> i've ever seen and certainly the worst caper don't waste your time if you love this you need to see better films
<START> nothing new is this tired <UNK> comedy that wastes the talents of danny glover and whoopi goldberg considering that this was produced by the stars and spike lee it's pretty tame and tired stuff and how come the <UNK> never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers blah
<START> having never seen the original dirty harry i judged this movie on a clean <UNK> and i must say i quite enjoyed it sure some of the acting by <UNK> locke made me a little <UNK> but hey it was the 80's but even if you can't get past her and i almost couldn't or her revenge killings which seemed a little overdone p it's worth it just for dirty harry or at the very least the bull dog he <UNK> names <UNK> p br br 7 10
<START> i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life there are actual <UNK> during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk and the <UNK> are like a broadway version of <UNK> singing the darkness of the forest oh the darkness of the dark dark forest or something else so <UNK> the singer has a terrible <UNK> and has been recorded with a <UNK> y <UNK> over some <UNK> up string section and fake drum beats it's horrible br br yes the male leads are awful so are the female ones this is one bad case of gender stereotyping it's so bad everything they say revolves around being a male or a female just playing up the stereotypes to the max makes me sick <UNK> boring br br the children were so <UNK> in their lines you couldn't understand them and why do female ghost children always wear cute little <UNK> in their hair pretty blue dresses and long hair and ghost boys always wear clean cut <UNK> with cute little shiny blond hair not scary stupid br br <UNK> face was way too <UNK> free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave nice beard and <UNK> <UNK> did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you <UNK> into town and go to the <UNK> br br stupid movie
<START> i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay for view channel i was intrigued i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart wrenching film i have ever seen i bought the dvd immediately after renting it the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i've never experienced with any other film as far as vietnam subject films go i think it is the best one although platoon runs a close second besides all of that i think it is also colin <UNK> best performance as an actor i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies
<START> even this early in his career <UNK> was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing this is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer <UNK> the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich <UNK> will lose his fortune br br nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace it's easy to get caught up in the clichés then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the title writing very witty and fun
<START> the word 1st in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims at least they don't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise br br 1st should refer to 1st draft of a script 1st takes used in each performance in the final film 1st edit in post production <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie is not cast too badly it's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate from the goofy script to the wooden performances and while suffering through this <UNK> together film by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery at <UNK> minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours br br going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes even in the equally awful lake <UNK> at least the performances bill <UNK> and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie in 1st to die one ends up <UNK> only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the <UNK> of the female <UNK> suicide br br the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters who i think were never quite told is a d a she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the <UNK> floor and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film <UNK> br br in a word don't waste your time with this one my wife and i wish we didn't but at least we created our own <UNK> by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater meanwhile in cleveland
<START> this movie is a waste of film stock do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an <UNK> on a <UNK> in broad daylight for anyone with <UNK> or a camera with a zoom lens to see it happened in this film do you believe that a deaf person would actually be <UNK> in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a <UNK> unit cooking supply services burial detail etc it happened in this film do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would <UNK> this same deaf k p to be part of an active combat mission to protect a <UNK> from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived it happened in this film would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn't realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would <UNK> and kill him it happened in this film would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a <UNK> at a <UNK> that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just <UNK> away they did it in this film and left any possible <UNK> to the <UNK> the germans might check totally <UNK> would you believe that over the <UNK> and in clear english the captain mentioned the <UNK> rank if not his name as the person he was speaking with and that the general in plain english over open <UNK> said that the <UNK> had to be <UNK> the next day maybe they should have just sent in an <UNK> to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films if it were i'm sure it would do well watch it at your own risk
<START> despite its interesting premise <UNK> is quite tedious with a <UNK> script and <UNK> directing it could have been <UNK> instead it <UNK> along with little tension
<START> what would you expect from a film titled <UNK> <UNK> presented as <UNK> <UNK> something like <UNK> or english patient there are lots of things i love about this film it's funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written i came to the film as a <UNK> <UNK> fan but was dubious when i read the plot it sounded ridiculous but the film doesn't come across like that because affleck as drew <UNK> plays his part perfectly one minute a child like adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants in fact we see <UNK> grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he <UNK> and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so bad br br this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesn't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time i particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by <UNK> the pleasure is in the reaction of tom <UNK> james gandolfini and the comments of brian <UNK> josh <UNK> it is the dilemma of the greedy tom <UNK> who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well br br the addition of daughter alicia christina <UNK> into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a christmas film of course its corny and contrived he's rich and handsome she's beautiful and single and so inevitably her and <UNK> end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face great one thing i would have liked was more use of <UNK> music to boost the atmosphere but i can't really complain i got what i wanted
<START> i am not going to lie this is a great movie i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre i saw it a second time and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes sid the <UNK> is not all that <UNK> but diego a mountain lion i think is really good in the movie the animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending it is worth taking kids 10 and under to but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring also the <UNK> in the characters is so interesting like i said it is a pretty good movie but i would rate toy story 2 or shrek higher 8 10
<START> why did i waste 1 5 hours of my life watching this why was this film even made why am i even commenting on this film br br one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was <UNK> for everybody i cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid somebody somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it it is incoherent it isn't experimental it's plain and simple garbage the film follows no plot line whatsoever just when you think you have something well you don't br br i think the ending brought some <UNK> to the film no pun intended the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on i don't think i put a spoiler in here not that it would matter this film is another must miss in the world of <UNK>
<START> the worst kind of film basically the us <UNK> of independence was replaced with a <UNK> screen and this fooled the <UNK> security for several days eh br br the <UNK> screen that would <UNK> run for less than 2 seconds off that watch <UNK> assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current which it wouldn't br br it would be possible with a dozen large car <UNK> and an <UNK> but that system wouldn't fit into the case sorry to be <UNK> but this isn't even close to being plausible the rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and i'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been <UNK> to charity or me
<START> five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their <UNK> they stop off at a store accidentally hit another car decide to just drive off leave it soon after the other car forces them to stop a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out shouts at them makes them take their clothes off makes them pee on them then randomly drives off <UNK> shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost are low on gas br br produced directed by greg <UNK> ryan <UNK> with <UNK> writing the thing <UNK> responsible for the cinematography editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film making decision taken here were deliberate to try <UNK> atmosphere tension realism suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube even then it's still slightly embarrassing a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining fun like pulling my <UNK> out with <UNK> the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb the amount of 1 star comments is revealing they can't all be wrong right it's message board which i think is much more of an <UNK> of what the average person thinks it's absolutely <UNK> by just about everyone the phrase 'the worst film i have ever <UNK> is used a few times to be fair most of these negative comments mention <UNK> same things i have to agree with them the story is terrible alright i suspect it's meant to be <UNK> but this minimal there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen it just feels totally random it goes on for ages the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff screaming a lot oh god the screaming there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly then there's the real killer the entire film is set shot within the confines of a mini van seriously the camera never leaves this car as you can imagine it gets really boring add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion br br on a technical level again i can see that the film making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk it really does look that amateurish that bad it's a complete <UNK> i hated every moment of every second of it just think the blair witch project 1999 only ten times worse looking sounding you will be almost there there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera work the almost pitch black grainy contrast levels the violence is tame too with a few <UNK> of blood a stabbing at the end br br low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes with a supposed budget of about 4 000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release the two <UNK> in the film were owned by members of the production that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there the locations the acting is pretty bad by the main cast i just hated all the fake put on crying screaming that didn't convince at all but did <UNK> immensely br br five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen i have seen a few films whenever anyone now <UNK> me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention i hated it every single aspect wretched moment of it
<START> first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel <UNK> did it and that was enough for me a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much <UNK> in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in danish theaters br br anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were <UNK> at how real it seemed and that it really struck a <UNK> with our feelings we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book br br the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish <UNK> dogma 95 which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier dancer in the dark br br in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g i joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home br br also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i haven't seen him before but i can't wait to see more of him br br lars p <UNK>
<START> robert taylor and stewart granger switch the <UNK> baddie roles they held in all the brothers were <UNK> taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad guy role but granger plays his part perfectly however the real hero in the story are the <UNK> and the <UNK> the film is perfectly made with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given the direction is taut and although the film is no light hearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film <UNK> ignored by the <UNK>
<START> in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little <UNK> on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna <UNK> in their <UNK> middle class care free life nor did i feel for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the story line <UNK> along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless here's a hint it occurs about 30 minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest
<START> would probably be the best word to describe this film in my opinion besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls well that was redundant it was the story that blew me away <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and gackt and i know some people will disagree with me on this one but it wasn't any of the big three actors the guys that played sho son and <UNK> that gave the best performance for me anyway it was <UNK> <UNK> boy 5 from battle <UNK> br br don't get me wrong i like hyde i worship his voice but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit <UNK> but i loved that scene where he <UNK> with the dead guy's body killing the other guys and gackt wasn't at all that bad too i preferred how his character was kind of <UNK> from the start nothing much i can say about my background on lee <UNK> wang i won't pretend to know him but he carried his own weight with the star <UNK> cast br br this movie <UNK> the way for one of the best <UNK> i've ever heard <UNK> no <UNK> forgive my spelling if it's wrong while the complete song lasts about nine minutes you wouldn't notice the length because you'd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together br br anyway this movie is a must see not only for the fans huge fan base but for those who enjoy sci fi futuristic movies asian style
<START> former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like <UNK> in the first series of oz but <UNK> <UNK> t that kind of film it s more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the <UNK> for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film <UNK> into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
<START> on paper this looked like a great concept average guy on the <UNK> dates up tight <UNK> museum <UNK> who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis however director <UNK> <UNK> and writer don payne of the <UNK> almost <UNK> <UNK> in having their hero g girl played by striking uma thurman come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt <UNK> luke wilson following his rescue by g girl from the statue of liberty jenny curiously asks matt what was g girl like matt replies she's kind of <UNK> i think the intent was to have jenny thurman be this lonely young woman who has no one in her life isolated by her great physical powers thurman does the best she can but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of <UNK> luke wilson is way too <UNK> in the role <UNK> of boyfriend and superhero girl friend br br my super ex girlfriend is also a victim of bad timing coming on the tail end of superman returns which plays superhero straight up so to speak with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought my super ex girlfriend was funny and enjoyed the movie given that this is an <UNK> <UNK> movie this could have been a lot better <UNK> starts with a great premise and really <UNK> it first off we all love the hero here neither jenny nor g girl is really all that likable this is surprising for uma thurman who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence in the beginning her jenny g girl is just plain weird shocking because if there is a woman who can play a superhero she is <UNK> looks great only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic instead of caricature although my super ex is not a straight superhero story rather a romantic comedy of sorts it does not provide what every superhero mythology <UNK> great super villain here we have professor <UNK> aka barry eddie izzard who really is evil <UNK> he is no lex luthor no plans for global <UNK> <UNK> rather barry does hold a grudge against g girl and <UNK> it has to do with their shared past what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time <UNK> or g girl luke <UNK> matt is just some dude who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero one of the annoying things he does is that he <UNK> in his <UNK> loser friend vaughn <UNK> wilson doing a bad whacked out <UNK> wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense and this <UNK> his likable charm this does however work in the comic sex scene with jenny matt while dating jenny g girl realizes that he is in love with his co worker hannah <UNK> anna <UNK> so how does matt break up with g girl well it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious br br dramatic superhero movies work romantic comedies with chemistry work what may be <UNK> difficult are superhero <UNK> disguised as romantic comedies everyone loves the hero however hero nut job maybe not with all uma <UNK> talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly and she does not get sufficient support from <UNK> and payne thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative <UNK> my super ex girlfriend is fun and funny though given all involved the movie could have been super
<START> hey <UNK> <UNK> is a film about a young woman <UNK> <UNK> esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn <UNK> <UNK> and pop all perhaps 15 17 years old in 1953 <UNK> <UNK> the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue <UNK> or anything american it seems br br the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 the year before the film was made br br i enjoyed the film with some <UNK> the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the <UNK> pace required it but i couldn't always both read the text and <UNK> the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about <UNK> <UNK> for a sick relative br br this <UNK> coming of age film effectively conveyed the <UNK> sense of <UNK> <UNK> and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main <UNK> and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were <UNK> a <UNK> the 1953 cast and what had actually happened br br i would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by the director <UNK> <UNK> 1941 1991
<START> the first war to be 100 <UNK> dan <UNK> line says it all this is a hard to describe film comedy satire action screwball it reminded once or twice of dr <UNK> especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley who did a remarkable job i think i had no particular expectations of this film though i am a big john cusack fan so i just let the movie wash over me and as a result i was quite entertained the political satire is painfully accurate and quite <UNK> of the us military business complex the sub plots were somewhat predictable but the final <UNK> of story lines made them all worthwhile i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us but for the rest of the world it is a <UNK> tale
<START> the name of nick <UNK> the young cast and the attractive cover of the vhs made me buy and watch this flick expecting to see a good teen slash movie what a crap the full of clichés screenplay the dialogs and the performances are awful dreadful very bad terrible horrendous  <UNK> a complete waste of time there is no horror black humor only an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points the film begins with six characters indeed three couples together like a group of friends but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies playing a ridiculous senseless game called taboo and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues that is it no previous development of the characters the viewer does not know who they are their motives and relationship then there is an <UNK> to one year later and the same group is gathered together in a new years eve party insulting each other in a very <UNK> way but the plot and the twists are so ridiculous predictable mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review one advice only do not waste your time or money on this garbage you will certainly regret my vote is one awful br br title brazil taboo  <UNK> com o <UNK> taboo  playing with the killer
<START> as a rule a full moon production <UNK> is a warning sign to avoid a film but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films i gave it a shot br br it's not bad not great but that's something else the film involves a struggle with a <UNK> evil brother who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character dr <UNK> also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world which he does successfully br br possible spoilers follow br br dr <UNK> can travel between <UNK> and does so to find a companion <UNK> a <UNK> however the guard has been <UNK> his eyes are ruined <UNK> so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes and hey <UNK> his eyes have been restored this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes br br later <UNK> and his brother <UNK> a couple of animal <UNK> in a museum to fight guess which one wins br br however side from that the picture isn't at all bad though much like a comic book dr <UNK> more human adventures are okay and combs plays the role convincingly br br i've seen lots worse
<START> <UNK> salt of the earth characters <UNK> beer <UNK> happy go lucky adventures working abroad salt of the earth characters warm wonderful people <UNK> bridge tear in the eye brown <UNK> salt of the earth characters cute little red indians children in <UNK> united tops <UNK> <UNK> salt of the earth characters br br etc etc etc br br please this is so poor and you should know better timothy <UNK> they can't have paid you that much br br as for jimmy nail well the <UNK> thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an <UNK> as he is a singer and writer come on jimmy the <UNK> over <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were very funny unfortunately i don't think they were supposed to be with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the opposite applies
<START> anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two <UNK> in the film this film is not under rated it is a bad movie br br there should be no comparisons between this film and the naked gun or airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny class reunion is neither of those things the sad thing is it had such potential good cast good story lines but the good jokes are few and far between the scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing the <UNK> guys the vampire the blind girl not funny the only funny character were <UNK> the one who sold her soul to the devil br br national lampoon has made some really good films animal house vacation but this isn't one of them i certainly expected more from john hughes
<START> there have been so many many films based on the same theme single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex pays him and then guess what she falls in love with him there's a bit of <UNK> followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending this has been done many times br br the thing is i knew this before starting to watch but despite this i was still looking forward to it in the right hands with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours br br this was none of these br br this was dire br br a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me i truly did not care if she got her man or remained single and unhappy br br a male lead who after a few of his endless words of wisdom i wanted to kill just to remove that smug look i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all seeing all knowing enlightenment br br a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters none of them seemed to have jobs all of them had more money than sense a <UNK> who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend plus i would miss you even if we had never met i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this <UNK> i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name woody but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film
<START> i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention maybe even missing the first half so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated i decided to <UNK> it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time i certainly did this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever i can't believe i thought this film was boring br br a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and <UNK> cox this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it it is truly horrifying oh and did i mention that the theme song is great as well well it is and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere br br everyone should see this movie for the experience just don't expect a <UNK>
<START> this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film <UNK> br br it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story wise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east br br people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior it's a slightly annoying pattern that <UNK> even in this film
<START> movie there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie its truly awful not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick characters actors denzel has done exactly what he does in every movie so no surprise there here is a little mind game for the readers quickly think of 10 denzel movies now count how many of them were in which he played a cop detective body guard whatever clive owen <UNK> this guy needs a better role on his plate soon his best performance was i think in beyond borders other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in sin city surely this guy knows acting what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles he is in desperate need of a better agent jodie foster was brilliant in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life she has done better she has had better roles it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as <UNK> foster did in this movie plot plot was not confusing in fact i could think of such a plot in fact the whole movie while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner i mean come on spoiler on the way i am sick of the un necessary <UNK> and the racism token the movie is about bank robbers why put the <UNK> and the racism in there nice try playing with people's emotions worked on anyone not me police let the bank robbers go thinking they were <UNK> <UNK> please we're talking about us police force and security here nobody could find out where clive was i mean they didn't find anything different with that room <UNK> we kidding conclusion sure go watch this movie if nothing you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was at least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast mistake
<START> higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background it's a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real <UNK> change in the way we have to be able embrace and understand diversity some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is ignorance <UNK> supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning sure it sounds like a <UNK> dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps
<START> i've read some of the comments about this film and can only <UNK> that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing it's so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in cliche ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull it's as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio <UNK> to give the story some true to life gusto or didn't have the <UNK> this movie could go in the <UNK> as the standard issue bad lifetime tv movie
<START> very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty row film company <UNK> who usually put out really cheesy films like devil bat or the flying <UNK> german <UNK> director <UNK> does wonders with a small budget and his studio bound swamp set <UNK> and <UNK> charles <UNK> is effective as the <UNK>
<START> a young man kills a young woman for no reason the man's brother is <UNK> on charges that he was an <UNK> but soon escapes upon escaping the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he <UNK> his girlfriend in on the plot if this isn't bad enough the situation quickly makes a <UNK> spiral br br this film had some good aspects and many bad ones its strongest aspect was lead actress emily <UNK> setting aside the fact she's nude in a fair amount of this film she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character i see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way i was convinced she was a ruthless individual br br also the makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches graphic nudity both male and female <UNK> and extreme <UNK> violence are not <UNK> away from i like my horror films to push the boundaries a little bit and this one ignored them altogether gladly skipping towards <UNK> maybe it was too much but i think they achieved what they were looking for br br but now the negative aspects first and most noticeable this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this i can excuse that the plot was decent the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing a more realistic feel so i won't <UNK> them for having low grade equipment what i will <UNK> them for is the use of poor choices in shots for no reason i can <UNK> besides <UNK> the movie there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery i don't really know why and i frankly started <UNK> off at this point because it was so long and pointless br br i also take issue with the title the idea here was to <UNK> people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic i spit on your grave now there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of the woman from this other film and the themes are very loosely the same a woman getting revenge on men but there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store <UNK> to think they were getting a sequel this was <UNK> and <UNK> br br my last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense not even a little bit a woman is killed in the beginning for no reason a prison <UNK> finds time to kidnap people to torture them for no reason because they <UNK> his girlfriend the same man goes from good to very evil without explanation likewise the female lead <UNK> turns <UNK> ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic for no reason at all and against people who for the most part were only <UNK> mean to her a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong but by no means worth getting tortured for br br don't let this title fool you or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking yes some scenes were shocking but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a <UNK> if you see this in the video store or on netflix just keep <UNK> or rent it and we can sit around and <UNK> about it for hours you have been warned
<START> michael winner is probably best known for his revenge themed films such as death wish and <UNK> land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema as the sentinel of 1977 proves the sentinel which is based on a novel by john <UNK> who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious <UNK> that no lover of occult horror should consider missing the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as rosemary's baby the exorcist or the omen but as far as i am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even <UNK> br br allison parker christina raines is a beautiful young new york model traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend chris sarandon allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also <UNK> in an old mansion in brooklyn the new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other <UNK> and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little <UNK> to alice this may not be an adequate plot synopsis but i would hate to spoil any of this film's great moments so i will not give any further plot description what i will say however is that the sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that <UNK> from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere the fact that director michael winner and writer john <UNK> also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome the film is <UNK> photographed and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film as mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shock moments and genuine scares the film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker lovable and yet on the <UNK> to losing her mind chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as christopher walken jeff goldblum jerry <UNK> beverly <UNK> and tom berenger before becoming really famous the cast also includes stars like <UNK> <UNK> horror icon john carradine burgess meredith and my personal favorite the great eli <UNK> as a cynical homicide detective i've been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time mostly for films like death wish and <UNK> land the sentinel is yet another great film in <UNK> <UNK> and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard boiled revenge cinema but also of atmospheric occult horror all in all the sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult <UNK> that is highly recommended to all horror fans
<START> disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a <UNK> day and several other dances one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine here we see astaire doing what are essentially stage dances in a <UNK> form than in his films with ginger rogers and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film best of all the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio tv husband wife comedy career doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s george was once a tap dance <UNK> their two numbers with fred are high points of the film and worth waiting for the first soft shoe trio is a warm up for the <UNK> up <UNK> carnival number in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other <UNK> it almost seems spontaneous fan of fred astaire and burns allen will find it worth bearing up under the plot i've seen this one 4 or 5 times and find the fast forward button helpful
<START> so fox pulled the plug <UNK> through a drama mystery br br how lame is that do they expect us to <UNK> our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens why weren't the remaining already filmed episodes aired in the us they were broadcast elsewhere br br hey fox are you listening this was a great show but you left us hanging if you're going to introduce new drama mysteries at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid theme every time something like this happens and it seems to happen a lot with you i e fox there are more of those who will wait and see before <UNK> their time this means you will see an <UNK> low interest share and are more likely to end the series see it is a vicious cycle don't let us down again
<START> the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again however i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director <UNK> credits that <UNK> me aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience i am hoping i would get some answers to my <UNK> from some one possibly one of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the film
<START> okay <UNK> i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking <UNK> jolie and duchovny how could the <UNK> actor possibly compete with <UNK> natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even david's humor matched up to <UNK> spark and fire as for <UNK> he played the psycho very well <UNK> with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it 8 stars
<START> victor mclaglen the title character of john ford's the informer reminded me of the circus man from <UNK> la <UNK> anthony quinn played the <UNK> man who may have even been influenced by the <UNK> faced oscar winning performance given by mclaglen poverty stricken <UNK> is the true life atmospheric setting of the picture which takes place in <UNK> dense fog and a long <UNK> night are the main elements of a story about deep irish <UNK> and the fight of the irish <UNK> army the conflict of <UNK> and the cause is what makes the informer <UNK> <UNK> large simple character just wants to go to america and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently two different signs become the psychological <UNK> for the drunken <UNK> one is the previous the other a wanted sign should he do it and get the money to go br br john ford once <UNK> said my name is ford i make westerns after seeing this film he obviously could do a heck of a lot more the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about and the look of the piece is amazing <UNK> of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night ford was always known for his <UNK> gorgeous cinematography that helped to <UNK> the conflicts within his characters this is hard in color but he did it in pictures like the <UNK> painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner victor <UNK> performance not only benefits from the lighting but by the sheer simplicity of his acting he <UNK> a lot he knocks people out he is a <UNK> who knows no better he should however know whether or not to cross the ira br br see the film to find out the gritty details see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira max <UNK> score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters placing more emphasis on them this was usually only seen in silent films especially chaplin the topic of <UNK> names or <UNK> is obviously still important just look at how the media covered this year's oscars giving much attention to the <UNK> kazan scandal
<START> what an incomprehensible mess of a movie something about a cop who <UNK> bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now and a top secret tank <UNK> by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear and you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word <UNK> either gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from lethal weapon and while busey is a <UNK> actor the screenplay <UNK> the whole movie to mediocrity william smith does another turn as a russian soldier the same character he played in red dawn a few years earlier after playing biker <UNK> for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist <UNK> sadly he'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood <UNK> in every which way you can
<START> films such as <UNK> beau <UNK> and others have <UNK> french director claire denis into the top <UNK> of the world's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film the intruder <UNK> adds to the depth of her <UNK> a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of <UNK> loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is <UNK> physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jean luc <UNK> <UNK> of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such <UNK> <UNK> that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than <UNK> <UNK> terms br br louis <UNK> michael <UNK> is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in <UNK> <UNK> wild <UNK> attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally <UNK> and the look on his face is one of quiet <UNK> though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit man br br whatever the case he apparently is under some kind of <UNK> and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal <UNK> and is only now able to see the consequences facial close ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the <UNK> mountains near the french swiss border and has an estranged son sidney <UNK> <UNK> whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his money br br when the film opens we meet <UNK> a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to <UNK> out some <UNK> when she comes home she is <UNK> by her husband who asks her with tongue in cheek if she has anything to <UNK> other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in <UNK> imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film's first half hour a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> his <UNK> a neighbor <UNK> <UNK> who is a dog <UNK> who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian <UNK> dealer <UNK> <UNK> who he tells he wants a young man's heart br br relentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to <UNK> to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately <UNK> <UNK> into other people's lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart <UNK> of the band <UNK> reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim <UNK> dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular <UNK> godard br br godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an <UNK> in a <UNK> looking up at his father for a good two minutes the <UNK> expression gradually turning from <UNK> to a half smile colored <UNK> blowing from a newly <UNK> ship a <UNK> in a dark room by a mysterious korean <UNK> and the vast <UNK> of ocean seen from a <UNK> ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its <UNK> nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed <UNK> in the film your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart
<START> zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to <UNK> the dead while trying to escape the man is shot at the metal <UNK> holding the chemical is <UNK> the man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating <UNK> zombie within hours the surrounding area is <UNK> with the flesh <UNK> undead on the look out for fresh victims kenny <UNK> <UNK> his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help patricia <UNK> ring her friend <UNK> deborah <UNK> who has been <UNK> by zombie birds general <UNK> is in charge of the situation has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world but will he his men succeed br br this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke therefore couldn't finish the film so producer franco <UNK> asked second unit director bruno mattei writer <UNK> <UNK> to step in complete the film apparently mattei <UNK> did more than just finish it they actually <UNK> a lot of the footage fulci shot added a lot of their own zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50 50 split the script by <UNK> is an absolute mess none of it is well thought out is just as stupid as it gets the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd the zombies themselves have no <UNK> whatsoever look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge the zombies are slow as they <UNK> along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the <UNK> because that one runs around like it's on <UNK> then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks <UNK> there are so many things wrong with zombi 3 scene after scene of terribly thought out <UNK> directed action awful character's really dull broken english dialogue which doesn't make sense half the time then there's the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the <UNK> suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air bite <UNK> neck the scene when the guy's in white <UNK> suits at the end are about to kill kenny roger but instead of using their automatic <UNK> they decide to try kill them by hand even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their <UNK> when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their <UNK> it's one of the most <UNK> handled scenes ever put to film then there's the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but can't rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some <UNK> of grass what since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under <UNK> of grass this all may sound <UNK> but believe me it's not it's a really bad film that is just boring repetitive simply doesn't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs br br it's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot it has a bland lifeless feel about it for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in <UNK> the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine you can see that at one corner of the screen the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> as it is coming straight out of the machine <UNK> out as it <UNK> across the scene since a lot of it is set during the day it doesn't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever when they do get it right the <UNK> is <UNK> spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a <UNK> day the direction is poor with no <UNK> it just looks feels bottom of the barrel stuff even the blood gore isn't up to much there's a gory hand <UNK> at the start a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman's stomach a <UNK> woman what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way why didn't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70's early 80's will be very disappointed there aren't any decent feeding scenes no intestines no stand out <UNK> <UNK> very little gore at all br br technically the film is poor the special effects are cheap looking the cinematography is dull the music is terrible the locations are bland it has rock bottom production values this was actually shot in the <UNK> to keep the cost down to a minimum the entire film is obviously dubbed the acting still looks awful though the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesn't understand the language that well br br zombi 3 is not a sequel to <UNK> classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 1979 it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash in title i'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film it's boring it makes no sense it's not funny enough to be entertaining it lacks any decent gore one to avoid
<START> i felt compelled to write a review for space <UNK> as it has received a good score of 7 3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie space <UNK> is the funky tale of a <UNK> and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to <UNK> the planets powers this is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm space <UNK> is very much <UNK> to a western audience and very easy to watch there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime <UNK> to watch and enjoy space <UNK> himself is witty and likable i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny the style is very sixties <UNK> with a fantastic soundtrack by <UNK> the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so <UNK> and convincingly you barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience check out if you can
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970 but return played like a typical sequel everything about it budget script plot casting and acting was inferior to the original <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> woman an elder of the yellow hand tribe looks nothing like an indian and neither do half of the other indians who were played by italians <UNK> and <UNK> with cheap <UNK> and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old <UNK> than a fierce leader of warriors he even used the bow like a woman finally richard harris who did such a superb job in the original seems to be <UNK> this time around i guess he couldn't resist the easy paycheck he got for <UNK> his role as horse br br to be fair there are some interesting moments in the movie such as <UNK> <UNK> a painful <UNK> ritual to find his vision and <UNK> the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white <UNK> but on the whole return is uneven boring corny and predictable just like most sequels
<START> remade today this film would be a very creepy very disturbing dark comedy stalking obsession and a web of lies and <UNK> are given a 1948 <UNK> of aren't they cute <UNK> drake plays the stalker an <UNK> user of people alternately pathetic and manipulative grant plays the stalking victim alternately angry and oblivious br br vastly disturbing i haven't been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since br br
<START> wow this movie was absolutely brilliant i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace i thought the pace was perfect the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit man killer working for john rooney paul newman he <UNK> this job but does it because rooney <UNK> for his house and helps him <UNK> he had nothing and mr rooney gave him everything but his children are unaware that this is his job and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him he is placed in an awkward position and when an atrocity occurs he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge they rob <UNK> and much more and build a bond they're the perfect team hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were
<START> who done it contains many <UNK> laughs and gags it is not only one of the best stooges films with <UNK> it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced director <UNK> originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges but when curly howard suffered a career ending stroke it was <UNK> for the columbia comedy team of <UNK> and lane their version was released as <UNK> my terror it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of <UNK> br br old man <UNK> calls ace detectives <UNK> larry and moe out of fear that he will be murdered when they arrive at his home <UNK> has disappeared and his niece and <UNK> <UNK> try to get rid of the stooges will they find <UNK> and bring the niece and <UNK> to justice br br <UNK> is particularly funny in this film his reactions after being given a mickey by christine <UNK> are superb he gives his trademark sound <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and miss <UNK> is <UNK> trying not to laugh other funny scenes the close up of <UNK> <UNK> looking through the camera lens and the in the dark fight with all cast members involved br br <UNK> the <UNK> played by duke york is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film with his <UNK> hair he could almost pass for a <UNK> if he didn't tower over everyone else who done it is a gem among the stooges films with <UNK> even die hard curly fans will enjoy this one a true <UNK> classic 9 out of 10
<START> one of the best musicals ever made this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent rather than for what people might expect the lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect this has a special name that i cannot think of the dialog is also unique in that no <UNK> are used the movie is well paced beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish a real joy is the music such an array of first rate songs from beginning to end that are perfectly performed and <UNK> also the music is very original and very memorable and i think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties it certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that might have only two or three not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it
<START> this movie gets it right as a former <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i can tell you this movie has it all the tedium of the <UNK> process the waiting for word the joy of acceptance the worry about making it through the course the sorrow of watching one's buddies perhaps the best of them wash out the anguish of paying the ultimate price the death of <UNK> student <UNK> the glory of <UNK> always the flying the flying the flying many are called but few are chosen we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do
<START> saw it as critic at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br as every film that i know and <UNK> is involved in it is simply <UNK> br br i love his way of combining different stories and characters br br his <UNK> and the truly magic powers part of <UNK> <UNK> erotic tales iv are definitely worth being checked out go and get it folks
<START> i found this on the shelf while <UNK> and bored how can people possibly give this a 10 it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel good redemption film i think because it doesn't work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there's just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially <UNK> <UNK> are just terrible the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow it's only an hour and a half but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back
<START> beverly garland was born in the wrong time she was an actress ahead of her time bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the corman films she starred in in <UNK> she's the town <UNK> wife he gets <UNK> so she takes over his job to pursue his killers she's better than the material she's working with by far the movie is gray stilted and mostly boring there's some unintentional humor with the tire tracks everywhere people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another i've heard of false <UNK> but this is ridiculous and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her even if she hadn't loved her husband it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died and she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end anyway no luck with men this one br br the villain of the piece is another woman the saloon owner she's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the <UNK> goes through and makes her rich her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and <UNK> hell it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town are you telling me these people aren't armed look what happened in real towns of the old west when bank robbers came in to rob the bank then were cut down in a <UNK> of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk br br <UNK> a lot of pointless talking and riding around interspersed with a few lame shoot outs the ending is as grim as usual in a corman flick although thank goodness it lacks the moral <UNK> at the end that was in it <UNK> the world the sheriff turns over her <UNK> to sam bass and rides off into the sunset although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun
<START> i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster vhs i have to agree that it is wildly original yes maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies rather we are treated to the director's eye his vision of what the story is about and it does not stop and to be honest i didn't want it to i do believe that <UNK> had to have influenced the director's of <UNK> stock two smoking <UNK> and <UNK> lola <UNK> but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them <UNK> i really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight culture <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> go somewhere else if you want a laugh camera movement and criminal hilarity look here
<START> gus van <UNK> has made some excellent films i truly am a fan br br however i can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even <UNK> get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van <UNK> are incredible <UNK> and towers of talent ultimately though this one just didn't work br br it wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive it's just that our <UNK> are much more powerful when reading a book like this we're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and or the best and it adds to the overall roller coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's <UNK> movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller coaster <UNK> from the overall experience this is what i believe happened here br br i suggest reading the book
<START> same old same old about che it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che's true character <UNK> <UNK> the same boring narrative of che the silly seductive tale of an <UNK> rich boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor until eventually he was murdered by the cia yeah yeah heard it all before boring and untrue the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive the facts show that he was a <UNK> with a <UNK> streak who openly wanted to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the world he was so <UNK> that at the <UNK> moment in the cold war he even <UNK> the soviet union to <UNK> new york washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world che <UNK> <UNK> to launch a nuclear strike against us cities for the rest of his life he <UNK> that if his finger had been on the button he would have pushed it when <UNK> backed down and literally saved the world che was furious at the betrayal if che's <UNK> had been followed you would not be reading this review now how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his <UNK> media transformation that would make an oscar winning film i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being <UNK> they only stick to safe <UNK> themes to wit che cool wall street bad <UNK> nazi bush ex hitler <UNK> is worse than <UNK> christians are fanatics and stupid etc ad <UNK> <UNK> how daring how mind blowing <UNK> anti mainstream and edgy i wish they would have some real <UNK> and tackle the independent film <UNK> that would be truly daring
<START> the lady in question 1999 starring gene wilder is a well acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black and white raymond <UNK> perry mason series both perry and cash kept me guessing right up to the end there were many suspects with a motive for the murder but i had no idea which character it would be br br gene wilder has a special charming wit about him even in his facial expressions and vocal <UNK> which make him perfect for the part the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie even his singing was a delight i like him in this role more than his former <UNK> roles like the young frankenstein and willy <UNK> i am hoping a e will continue this series they ought to call it something like the a e gene wilder mysteries br br the music fit the period i enjoyed the cool live <UNK> and the swing tunes i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script to me that always <UNK> br br overall my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well crafted start in what we hope will be many others just like one of our other favorites raymond <UNK> perry mason
<START> i just watched this on turner classic movies last night for the first time ever seeing it and i loved it i like lots of the older films especially because of the absence of all the filthy language and excessive violence nudity and sex in most of today's films i also think they were made much better in many but not all cases jimmy stewart is a special favorite of mine i just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and i enjoyed it thoroughly if you feel the same way about the older films i don't think you can go wrong with this one i believe you've got mail is a remake even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film of this film for a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing get this or catch it on one of the classic movie channels
<START> i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take because of its length and story i liked it very much i was impressed first by the script and then by the realization of this script the film takes you on a ride but that is not an easy <UNK> ride it goes through time and different political <UNK> and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives what i loved was the inner logic the film followed logic which just like logic in life was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end when i thought about it all the events and twists made sense it makes no sense though to try to re tell the story as it <UNK> in more than 50 years of time i also liked very much <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> and the way he played it as some critics would saw with restless abandon what i didn't like about it was that i think he later played characters that remind me of <UNK> in films like cruel romance <UNK> <UNK> which i actually love and to some extent in the insulted and the injured <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> shows i think what a great film maker <UNK> <UNK> was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like tango and cash and less forgettable like runaway train i would prefer <UNK> <UNK> to them
<START> i didn't have huge expectations for this film when renting it for 1 at the video store but the box at least showed a little promise with its killer cut of more gore more sex can't go wrong there well needless to say the box is a fraud how in the <UNK> did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low br br it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend as a camera on a bad <UNK> follows her then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another they <UNK> her <UNK> for no real reason and you can see when they cut her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a <UNK> br br from there repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased killed <UNK> by two guys for about <UNK> more minutes add in one <UNK> shot that is soul survivors br br i wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not <UNK> me into renting the flick if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex i want more violence and sex one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly <UNK> and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it if this is the killer cut what is the theatrical cut of course i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place shame on the actors in this film i could see them making their screen <UNK> in here because they have not done anything before but they were all established before this was released i don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi big names or not but what i want to know is they really spent 14 million on this film
<START> i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywood br br the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house it's even covered with clothes is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer <UNK> a <UNK> under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not believe so common logic and any concept of <UNK> <UNK> the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic <UNK> is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight year old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please there's more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference even with a <UNK> on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood <UNK> for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not laugh i <UNK> and rolled my eyes br br but i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone 3 also raises a question we all know alex d <UNK> stars in the movie but did he write it as well
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a beautifully photographed <UNK> <UNK> with the work of the director i am well <UNK> with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to <UNK> <UNK> while not even approaching <UNK> in greatness <UNK> has <UNK> nothing of <UNK> depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space one of the things he misses entirely is <UNK> attention to character we are not even introduced by <UNK> to his lead character a perfect blank page there are no medium or close shots of his people one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what <UNK> doesn't a good look at their faces br br there was a great spanish film by <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> to something like nothing ever happens that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise all through the film we are given clues about an obscure <UNK> composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack but the clues like everything else add up to nothing unless you're a <UNK> this film has nothing to recommend it
<START> when thinking of the revelation that the main character in bubble comes to at films end i am reminded of last years <UNK> with christian <UNK> the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters br br an understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life the title is cause for <UNK> perhaps we the audience are the ones in the bubble as we are given no <UNK> in the films slim 90 minute running time audience reactions were often smug and <UNK> clearly <UNK> how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w back in office for a second term br br it's <UNK> to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role this film has it's merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn't say outright
<START> this film was slow but tedious and the acting often <UNK> into the land of ham <UNK> character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with <UNK> 20 something for the love of <UNK> character why is beyond me the title of the movie should have been shallow people on the lake the actors played like they were in a rehearsal a dreadfully predictable ending to boot i can't believe this is on this website as a comedy
<START> broken bow takes us back to where it all began set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk spock and mccoy this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since <UNK> to <UNK> the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before scott <UNK> is perfectly cast as jonathan archer the first captain of the first star ship enterprise he and the entire cast truly show a true <UNK> for the star trek legacy john <UNK> is brilliant as the alien dr <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is totally <UNK> as the <UNK> but logical <UNK> science officer <UNK> broken bow is in my opinion the best <UNK> episode of any of the <UNK> and i believe gene <UNK> would surely be proud
<START> when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from <UNK> an old plantation owner who uses <UNK> for labor <UNK> is what makes the move his funny <UNK> give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if <UNK> lived today he would be <UNK> with <UNK> disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the <UNK> is complex while he has racist views he's grown to trust some of the <UNK> who are all black the two <UNK> he <UNK> most are jackson mel <UNK> and ben james earl jones the conversations between ben and <UNK> are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel <UNK> both but in great performances as well as <UNK> br br this movie should have gotten more <UNK> however it's on dvd and worth the money br br <UNK>
<START> this movie was excellent it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the <UNK> communist regime in russia during the 80's i give this movie high marks for it's no holds <UNK> look into the birth and development of <UNK> investigation in a <UNK> isolated thanks to the regime community this is a graphic movie it presents an <UNK> picture of violence and it's tragic remains nothing is candy <UNK> with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen this movie is based on russian serial killer <UNK> <UNK> i'm familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film it's not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a must see
<START> the case of the <UNK> tail has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie the story is standard giallo when a man dies in a plane crash his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a 1 million life insurance policy the widow heads to <UNK> for the <UNK> but a series of gruesome murders follow her there are plenty of suspects including a <UNK> investigator george hilton from the insurance agency and the <UNK> lover director martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer anita <UNK> also memorable in your vice is a locked room and only i have the key and who saw her die is a stunning looking heroine it's one of <UNK> best films
<START> how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn paul <UNK> and kevin spacey apparently very difficult for the writers here br br i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince who plays the big brother i must have missed that part of the story but in reality it really didn't matter many scenes seemed out of place and contrived the kind of funny notion scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lost br br the director producer tried to go tear <UNK> at the end which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth following br br ugh major disappointment i can see how some people might enjoy this ok since many people will take any garbage they're fed but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one not worth the 23 <UNK> it takes to get your family to the movies these days
<START> okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it receives br br the camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast minus the helpless victims is strong br br what i don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex what's the purpose and they're aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later mythology br br i'm giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
<START> actually my vote is a 7 5 anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don't <UNK> me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to <UNK> <UNK> however the film is good
<START> im proud to say i've seen all three fast and furious films sure the plots are kinda silly and they might be a little cheesy but i love them car chases and all the beautiful cars and the <UNK> midnight races and ill gladly see a fourth one br br wanna know what the difference is between those three and <UNK> decent acting somewhat thought out plot even if they are <UNK> and last but not least directors who have a clue all three were made by very competent directors all of them took the films in a different direction equally exciting <UNK> looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch and made them the extras then picked up his leads from hollywood's <UNK> line and the script <UNK> its mystery science theatre 3000 bad this is 70's made for tv movie bad br br yeah the movie had a few cool cars but you don't really get to see that many in action and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases and if the cars aren't thrilling you why go to a movie like this br br im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers and i cant stop laughing out loud im getting dirty looks but this was just a <UNK> br br rent the f f movies go to <UNK> race go to a <UNK> track and race yourself whatever you do avoid <UNK> like bad cheese
<START> i appreciate the need to hire <UNK> for these kind of <UNK> movies but they should at least hire some proper actors the sergeant especially is guilty of using his <UNK> to <UNK> every single line he has but let's face it the lines aren't really important there isn't really a <UNK> plot so most of the writing involves the words f k s t m f r and other <UNK> bad language in place of proper dialogue br br the <UNK> as it is is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death with a couple of cringe worthy <UNK> which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen not only this but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors why are they going in there didn't he have a weapon wasn't he dead so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them br br another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience
<START> how did this ever come into existence i generally love sci f bigfoot whatever films etc but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this the effects were sad the lines were <UNK> avoid at all costs i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance <UNK> in it still haven't seen that one the idea of the film is actually a good one there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here i just don't understand how something like this ends up like this go speak to the film arts english interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script
<START> what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously br br hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years this is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye <UNK> at the camera br br rachel mcadams is wonderful as always cillian murphy is <UNK> than he was in batman begins in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but cillian murphy is really good at being bad br br the directing is surprising stylish the story is good but the dialog could have used some <UNK> up br br red eye is a really fun film and people were <UNK> when the closing credits started rolling if you are in the mood for an enjoyable <UNK> thriller red eye might be your ticket
<START> this is your typical <UNK> movie a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy <UNK> over hidden money whether it is a winning <UNK> ticket in <UNK> weekly black money in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc the director is becoming ridiculously predictable don't get me wrong as clichéd and preposterous his movies may be i usually end up enjoying the comedy however in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> being noteworthy ones now the hilarity of his films is <UNK> as he is using the same formula over and over again br br songs are good <UNK> <UNK> looks awesome <UNK> <UNK> is irritating and <UNK> is not a whole lot better <UNK> <UNK> is ok and <UNK> <UNK> is the best
<START> <UNK> minnelli directed some of the most celebrated <UNK> in cinema history he was among the first hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment br br <UNK> in <UNK> is the story of an ex <UNK> who remains in france after the war to study and paint he falls in love with a charming <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their romantic love affair <UNK> as <UNK> as the city of lights itself the whole movie brings a touch of french <UNK> where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect <UNK> br br the first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of leslie caron in her screen debut she is like a diamond a touch of class george <UNK> describes his fiancée ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy <UNK> and modern <UNK> and awesome the number leads to an <UNK> <UNK> where kelly and his very good friends in paris share a gentle parody of <UNK> <UNK> later kelly <UNK> a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him 'i got rhythm ' and at the massive jazz nightclub kelly spots the girl of his dreams he is instantly hit by her <UNK> <UNK> blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull <UNK> onto the dance floor and sing to her it's very clear our love is here to stay br br to the <UNK> <UNK> la la ' kelly provides humor wit and talent all around oscar <UNK> room and even on the top of his brown piano br br when he meets his pretty cinderella along the <UNK> river kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with caron he expresses all his emotions with <UNK> love is here to stay ' the piece had a definite <UNK> feel as the two lovers were <UNK> in soft blue <UNK> light they start an enchanting dance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> elements caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way they move <UNK> away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug br br the film's weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story in one georges <UNK> performs an entertaining stage show with <UNK> in giant <UNK> floating down to the stage in another oscar <UNK> <UNK> himself <UNK> a concert and playing not only a piano <UNK> but the other <UNK> as well he even <UNK> to himself as members of the audience br br the <UNK> climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design it is a <UNK> of love fury and <UNK> it is kelly's major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> br br the number starts at the <UNK> arts ball after kelly finds himself separated from <UNK> and begins a sketch with a black <UNK> it <UNK> the important parts of the film's story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the <UNK> who have influenced jerry the tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the place de la <UNK> <UNK> the madeleine flower market the place de <UNK> to his <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> with the <UNK> dancers in a representation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self caron seems to dominate her space and <UNK> you away to another time and place br br nina <UNK> appeared very attractive and elegant in her one <UNK> white <UNK> in one of the film's most famous lines kelly asks her <UNK> quite a dress you almost have on what holds it up nina cleverly replies modesty br br <UNK> american in <UNK> garnered six oscars including an <UNK> award to gene kelly the film gave us a wealth of memories to take home
<START> first off the lead brad <UNK> is a <UNK> if you're trying to take this movie seriously then i guarantee he's going to ruin it for you if you don't take him too seriously then he's actually kind of fun to watch as with another reviewer i loved the scene where lisa <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> their love for each other in between <UNK> the <UNK> of flame shooting out of his arm in the car another great campy scene was watching john <UNK> as a <UNK> radio show producer getting <UNK> and <UNK> around the room in fact i found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non stop laugh riot i'm just not sure if tobe hooper meant it to be that way
<START> clint <UNK> arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of <UNK> is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important <UNK> learn of <UNK> reputation as a pistol <UNK> town <UNK> as they are living in fear of a mysterious <UNK> who is <UNK> the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire <UNK> to rid the town of it's <UNK> elements br br man with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over 200 votes and a <UNK> 9 user comments written for it it's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an <UNK> town turning to an <UNK> dark angel probably hasn't done the film any <UNK> over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought it's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture <UNK> many enjoyable moments both technically and as a <UNK> story br br robert mitchum is in the lead as <UNK> perfectly cast he <UNK> thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had <UNK> of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we don't see his face but we can feel that <UNK> <UNK> staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in <UNK> shadow so really it's solely with the big man that the films acting <UNK> are high perhaps it's unfair to single out ted de <UNK> for a kick but man with the <UNK> minor <UNK> are with its villains and sadly de <UNK> is lacking any sort of <UNK> menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of <UNK> will certainly be <UNK> their ears up and the cinematography from lee <UNK> is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and co written by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but it's dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable 7 5 10
<START> this film is a complete re imagining of romeo and juliet in tel <UNK> and <UNK> the lovers are one from tel <UNK> et the other from <UNK> there is a border between them and a constant state of war with the israeli army ever present everywhere and the palestinian <UNK> everywhere else with their bombs the situation is bleak enough we can imagine love in that enormous <UNK> trap but the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay noam from tel <UNK> and <UNK> from <UNK> to be gay is accepted in tel <UNK> it is off limits in <UNK> the conflict between the two peoples the two <UNK> is thus <UNK> with a conflict between two cultures two <UNK> but this could even be <UNK> if the war did not bring some extra dimension <UNK> sister is going to get married to a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> finally tells his sister about his being gay she cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later from the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a <UNK> into tel <UNK> to set up a bomb attack it takes place in a <UNK> in tel <UNK> and one friend of <UNK> is severely wounded bad enough the <UNK> army sends a <UNK> to <UNK> to arrest the person responsible for this attack but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street the funeral follows the wedding the husband and widower <UNK> for a suicide bomb attack <UNK> <UNK> to take his place the <UNK> lover comes back to tel <UNK> to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister he arrives at a diner managed by some friends of <UNK> but noam sees him and gets out to speak to him <UNK> has moved back to the middle of the street and he <UNK> his bomb when noam reaches him in the street the vengeance <UNK> the two lovers in death we thus have the <UNK> conflict but we do not have the prince of <UNK> a neutral character that can <UNK> peace or even worse the prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of israel the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides but the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is <UNK> by a play in the film a play that shows love in <UNK> between two prisoners one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle this is both strikingly strong and <UNK> shocking gay love in <UNK> what comes out of the film is that over there in tel <UNK> or <UNK> love is impossible the film is thus a <UNK> of the conflict in <UNK> that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on we should never have let great britain deal with the region a long time ago today we have to find a solution in which no one will be <UNK> this will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution but so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so suffering will go on and love will be forbidden of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on so let's <UNK> more and more little soldiers but love is just an extra <UNK> concept br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well awful is just the first name this movie is a cliché ridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp i'm sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve br br this may contain spoilers br br just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the <UNK> military police will not come to get you if you don't make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didn't work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldn't have been able to save the scene br br next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my life br br there are also girls in the camp exciting one <UNK> even a model though not looking that great and the <UNK> actress i've ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie br br okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two <UNK> with <UNK> wire br br there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the <UNK> keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at night br br there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well done br br one sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those <UNK> are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can get br br in the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fiancée sure i buy that the italians are that way a jealous bunch not br br the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen <UNK> not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live <UNK> are open to the public anyone can <UNK> drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or <UNK> br br the deed however is prevented by the good captain <UNK> <UNK> a rocket into the <UNK> car the explosion knocks the hit men and the <UNK> fiancée off their feet no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to <UNK> it's a comedy remember br br okay it's a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those it's just embarrassing a rip off from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done <UNK> with no amateur actors br br it is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn
<START> i have yesterday seen the second part and i must say it was actually better then the first one at the begin i realized it is actually a sequel not a remake but not a good one i do not like the old movies and series of galactica because the <UNK> saw like <UNK> just as it was mentioned in this new movie and were completely harmless for the old galactica this movie turns the sides the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid many scenes were unnecessary for instance the story of the computer expert completely a crap if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house killed by the <UNK> woman and the <UNK> from the planet oh please if it would be bombed by 50 <UNK> why exactly 50 <UNK> <UNK> they would be dead killed by the radiation and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of <UNK> was completely hidden before the attack <UNK> it was possibly this computer virus created by the <UNK> the script was probably written by ten years old school boy the good side of the movie is that the humans are at last defeated really defeated the population is near the <UNK> children are <UNK> two times explicit in the movie 1 a baby maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten what a violence and the bad <UNK> won and i think it is the first time in such sci fi galaxy fight movie i also appreciate the design of the <UNK> not only of the <UNK> <UNK> a good job with these ships i like the design of the ships by both of them human an <UNK> the human ships are a good never version of the old ones and galactica really pretty with these <UNK> i liked that but this is all only the design is not enough the acting was really bad the whole plot was <UNK> only two things not the human <UNK> on the <UNK> and the human <UNK> at the end the dialogs were trivial and in the <UNK> <UNK> just stupid but that is not fault of the movie the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series but who would shoot such series what it would be about one star for the design the second one for the near <UNK> of humanity
<START> well of course not women are overly sensitive and <UNK> on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudo artistically <UNK> or blatantly <UNK> on unlike many of you i have only seen la <UNK> et la <UNK> twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert the blonde reminds me of a lovely <UNK>
<START> i thought this movie was hysterical i have watched it many times and recommend it highly mel brooks was excellent the cast was fantastic i don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating i loved it i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor his i just can't say enough about this movie i look for it to be on <UNK> but it never on enough for me the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also please put this movie on more often i can't see it enough leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ever since cinderella i always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting in this movie she was very funny and her and mel did a great job together they should put more of his movies on tv
<START> we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor we may confess the truth of what we see without being stupid confess that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it was created out of pure <UNK> without real concept br br well obviously many people like such stuff i don't i prefer well thought and <UNK> shows and i also confess that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring those love and drug stories there are so many exciting <UNK> with lot of suspense dallas e g but twin peaks can't catch my attention i don't care about those people except cooper and gordon cole
<START> i don't really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i can't remember seeing so many <UNK> in one film that weren't able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as well br br then there's the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot there's blood involved but when someone gets shot in <UNK> for ten times there's no blood at all well i guess that's just me br br to make a long story short because believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt
<START> the cast although nothing special all do an ok job the story seems like a good idea the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist so what's wrong with it br br for a start the special effects are really bad if this was made in the 60's it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly <UNK> the special effects creator of <UNK> <UNK> br br secondly the direction is weak this film just does not capture the essence of the story a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil or demon type creature should be tense or frightening it simply isn't br br all in all this is a pretty poor film and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining it is still probably best left alone br br a rather sad 4 10
<START> up to this point gentle rain was the movie i found the worst in history it has been <UNK> by this <UNK> out of asia it has one star and it is john rhys davies he is way out of shape to be the <UNK> magical flying baddie he is cast here the rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play no clichés were missed in the dialogue and the special effects were <UNK> in as often as possible br br it is fairly easy to see that somebody in asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit my guess is that any career with this movie in it's <UNK> br br do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie a hundred <UNK> couldn't <UNK> this turkey br br the one funny scene was unintentional the brother of the king appears on the scene the king a handsome older short asian actor bad actor the brother a six foot european also a bad actor no excuses were made for this they just expected us not to notice that this poor man's jet <UNK> brother was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap <UNK> <UNK> wig right out of an old western movie from the forties
<START> let's face it nancy drew was never great literature it is in the same category as babysitter club magic tree house <UNK> abc mysteries in fact it was one of the original formula stories nancy is perfect pretty thoughtful nice has no internal conflicts ever and never changes ned is pretty much the same the movie was true to that style and i have to say i liked it it will never be a great movie but it had a that same nostalgic flavor that the books held it had just the right amount of suspense for my children 8 and 10 there was almost no offensive language i liked the push for more conservative dress br br corky was a bit of an annoyance he was a little out of place on a high school campus i never quite got why he was there in the first place
<START> i've seen this film in avant premiere at <UNK> festival in <UNK> br br i saw the first trailer four years ago and from this moment i was waiting to see the final result i haven't been disappointed br br it is a full 3d movie with a high <UNK> black and white render clearly inspired by some comic books such as the ones from f miller in this <UNK> it goes one step further than the excellent sin city adaptation from r rodriguez this time almost no grey or any middle color but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film can't wait for <UNK> darkly br br the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements such as direction or plot the direction stays sober and controlled despite the <UNK> possibilities of the medium and that is a really good surprise br br the futuristic story paris <UNK> makes it a classic sci fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end despite a classic base plot an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes <UNK> absolute power of certain <UNK> gives this movie a great interest br br despite it is an animated film this one is obviously not made for children you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral only the cold reality it is far closer to a good film noir br br i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film we still feel the well known paris but it is <UNK> by a fine touch of <UNK> br br nevertheless i regret a few mistakes the montage is sometimes a bit flat one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs even though the technical is excellent it shows its limits in some romantic sequences a bit like final fantasy did those little things makes it a 7 10 br br altogether it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can the director christian <UNK> knows how not to fall into potential traps <UNK> they didn't ask john woo to do the job br br to conclude it is a film with <UNK> visuals an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction watch it if you can br br please excuse me for the spelling mistakes
<START> but this movie was a bore the history part was fine but the musical part was not not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard br br if sweet jesus was suppose to be comic relief it never work if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one the rest of them were trying to <UNK> him in every scene br br <UNK> and <UNK> were the only bearable characters in the whole movie br br the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical br br shouldn't you be <UNK> the songs after a musical except for a few <UNK> nothing else was worth the breath
<START> here's a real weirdo for you it starts out with another take off on the psycho shower scene on campus then gets <UNK> when several <UNK> and their <UNK> boyfriends head south for spring break the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean one of the college <UNK> wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open then it's lets rip off <UNK> county line time as dean stalks traps and <UNK> the witless witnesses one by one tony march is on target as the evil shotgun happy dean the movie's overall tone is truly disturbing the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it's also a study in despair shallow grave is a must for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the world over
<START> parker and stone transplant their <UNK> <UNK> ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results much of the film is <UNK> and matt running amok with their new toy box the plot is simplicity itself two average guys <UNK> a new sport a blend of <UNK> basketball with baseball <UNK> which becomes a national <UNK> along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights it runs like a stretched south park episode with the usual machine gun dialogue toilet humour and <UNK> from the heart br br if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us airplane and the naked gun series this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two dimensional <UNK> <UNK> in the role usually given to <UNK> <UNK> robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b <UNK> that has been his party piece ever since <UNK> and ernest <UNK> overacts as only he can but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner br br for those who haven't noticed yet parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star <UNK> than comics this <UNK> in the <UNK> given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create as usual they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra non pc vehicle <UNK> br br a special mention must go to <UNK> <UNK> who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and <UNK> <UNK> pair of <UNK> br br in summary this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much <UNK> on the naked gun airplane formula parker and stone could do something truly brilliant or absolutely awful if given full control over a future film america either lock these guys up or put them in charge
<START> i really do not know what people have against this film but it's definitely one of my favourites it's not preachy it's not <UNK> by it's moral it shouldn't be controversial it's just god any possible god no matter the religion and it's really funny br br jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final <UNK> are executed he's quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until he's <UNK> into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous ground br br ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than <UNK> his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly well br br as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place <UNK> pitch perfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or <UNK> exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it's a wonderful life wannabe br br jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you don't think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couple br br the movie feels <UNK> see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling <UNK> the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save <UNK> career which wasn't <UNK> anywhere
<START> there is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror <UNK> vs jason the scream movies cabin trash and especially stephen king's <UNK> attempts he's recycled every story from the <UNK> <UNK> to whatever often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one which still has the nail br br but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the <UNK> on the back of your neck stand on end this is the way it should be done the director creates tension and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror val <UNK> original cat people and robert wise a val <UNK> <UNK> and director of the haunting and the body <UNK> jacques <UNK> another val <UNK> <UNK> who directed a truly horrifying zombie film not the gross rubbish <UNK> did gross isn't scary folks it's just gross and lewis allen the <UNK> and of course jack <UNK> turn on henry james the <UNK> and the way the master of suspense hitchcock can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like under <UNK> br br ten stars
<START> admittedly i know nothing about baseball i'm not even a fan of the sport but that didn't stop me enjoying the <UNK> <UNK> latest film fever pitch a <UNK> <UNK> romantic comedy the film is not really about baseball rather it's really about relationships and the emotional <UNK> that can often take place br br jimmy fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as ben a <UNK> lightly nerdy <UNK> ben is a kind of man boy who unfortunately has never really grown up and he <UNK> an almost <UNK> addiction to the red sox baseball team ben has devoted his life to the sox and does everything from making the <UNK> to florida for spring training to <UNK> every square inch of his apartment in team <UNK> br br one day while taking his <UNK> <UNK> class to on a field trip to her office ben meets the go getting lindsey a wonderful drew barrymore lindsey is a corporate career <UNK> kind of girl but she has a kind of <UNK> that ben finds totally endearing he's initially <UNK> to ask her out thinking that she's way out of his class and lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in ben br br their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food <UNK>  and her <UNK> <UNK> provides the first clue that we are in fact watching a <UNK> brothers movie rather than accept <UNK> rather <UNK> request to <UNK> ben sticks around to play nurse <UNK> and janitor so ben <UNK> the toilet and the <UNK> teeth while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed br br when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch she begins the long <UNK> process of <UNK> the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards soon they are falling in love with lindsey <UNK> accepting ben's <UNK> devotion to his sport br br having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle ben has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game but their relationship which has progressed without a <UNK> throughout the winter hits a <UNK> at the start of the season br br lindsey wants ben to do other things like holiday with her parents and party with her friends but ben begins to have trouble <UNK> his interest to meet lindsey halfway can lindsey <UNK> to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work can she really <UNK> ben's <UNK> with sports can a die hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all of course lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion wielding friends <UNK> <UNK> buddy the skinny rich and blond robin <UNK> <UNK> insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30 however <UNK> curly haired sarah <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and molly <UNK> <UNK> supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben br br ben's <UNK> could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan while <UNK> <UNK> could be representative of any <UNK> mobile career driven woman fallon is terrific as ben <UNK> real big screen potential <UNK> the not insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic barrymore meanwhile is equally charming as the <UNK> lindsey particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs br br fever pitch really works and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to <UNK> this fragile territory br br much of the movie was filmed at <UNK> <UNK> park which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well as the ambiance of the games though fully <UNK> what <UNK> with the team will probably be limited to baseball <UNK> even so fever pitch is blessed with such a finely <UNK> and intelligently funny script that even <UNK> baseball fans will find much with which to connect mike leonard september <UNK>
<START> the concept of having laurel hardy this time in the role of <UNK> <UNK> works out surprisingly hilarious it <UNK> some funny situations and silly antics from especially stan laurel of course as usual br br the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a <UNK> formula it doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending it's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless so it works for the movie br br the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and <UNK> <UNK> goes deliciously over the top as the nutty professor br br the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed it all helps to make dirty work to be one of the better laurel hardy shorts br br 8 10
<START> my super x girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were <UNK> <UNK> uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend she was just simply fabulous luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time the supporting cast was also superb especially anna <UNK> who was extremely good a lot better than in the scary movie franchise br br <UNK> <UNK> did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well this film is clearly a 10 10 for it's cast uma thurman it's director it's screenplay and from it's original plot line this film is very highly recommended
<START> the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if you're going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a <UNK> in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they weren't obvious <UNK> they were <UNK> inducing <UNK> that showed how far they were <UNK> to try to make this movie work and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just <UNK> the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the <UNK> make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again
<START> sigh leave it to us <UNK> to take a stupid idea blow it out of <UNK> and try to market it as cool <UNK> is a mediocre band at best and a single gimmick will get you only so far br br to all you marketing idiots out there this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when <UNK> tries to <UNK> something br br <UNK> isn't scary <UNK> is lame <UNK> is over br br i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic faced idiocy sure they won the <UNK> br br no wait they won the <UNK> that's it i rest my case
<START> guy <UNK> third proper film not counting the god awful swept away is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling gangsters and chess fans of <UNK> previous efforts will probably hate revolver as much as i did with its twists and turns <UNK> <UNK> jason <UNK> plays jake a newly released ex con out to <UNK> revenge on the ridiculously named dorothy <UNK> a superbly <UNK> ray liotta but instead gets <UNK> with a couple of other cons one of which is andre 3000 from rap outfit <UNK> who throw him and us the audience a number of red herrings throughout the film all of which becomes extremely tedious the high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot slow mo shootout set to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all in all revolver is a flawed work not truly awful but far from <UNK> best that would still be lock stock if this film was a school <UNK> assignment it would be <UNK> <UNK> try harder '
<START> you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off well i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see <UNK> and i knew about <UNK> <UNK> taste for making himself the one and only star from <UNK> <UNK> but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his <UNK> i wanted to give <UNK> the <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in <UNK> in <UNK> however <UNK> has <UNK> rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched <UNK> going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is <UNK> his fancy at the moment he also finds time to <UNK> off films that he doesn't like something i thought was reserved for losers like me surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice and when he started <UNK> over his <UNK> baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a strange <UNK> for tacky music the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against <UNK>
<START> the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most <UNK> of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not for everyone this film details <UNK> investigation of <UNK> <UNK> being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the <UNK> <UNK> of old japan to <UNK> western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot hanzo 3 who's got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and there's a lot of needless blood and violence it is hanzo the razor after all
<START> this should be a great film meryl streep and jack nicholson co starring as two newspaper writers mike <UNK> directing uh uh it's dull dull dull pointless and predictable slow and <UNK> br br it's a cookie cutter <UNK> meets girl boy marries girl boy has affair girl leaves <UNK> story now <UNK> an original concept after <UNK> through two hours was it only two it felt like six i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy a romance a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in 1986 i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the <UNK> of streep et al is beginning to <UNK> and that the <UNK> on the master is beginning to fade it's not that it's such a bad picture it's just that it's such an un good one
<START> victor <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> tale of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema by poetry i mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play there is something very literary about the film almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen in this sense the film achieves depths many cannot but it is also rather slow at other times <UNK> the depths it once achieved in favor of <UNK> the film's star ashley judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here she fits the role of lead ruby like a <UNK> almost as if she didn't have to act she has true movie star presence in the film and hasn't really managed to convey the same <UNK> in her later films although she was impressive in normal life
<START> <UNK> high has become an amoral <UNK> of filth thanks to the <UNK> of the nearby nuclear <UNK> accidental release of toxic waste br br <UNK> chaos <UNK> with absurd violence and crude behavior rather horrible obviously intended to be mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the <UNK> allowing the <UNK> cast free reign to ham it up craft was far down <UNK> list of <UNK> for this gory <UNK> the honor society are <UNK> with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits the german teacher who becomes a member through a toxic kiss has the <UNK> down one side of her face that really gave me the creeps the toxic monster which <UNK> the annoying <UNK> towards the end is pretty cool though br br kind of movie trash <UNK> will embrace <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise it reminded me of the wild <UNK> in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa it's a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lot br br david michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful <UNK> woman called <UNK> <UNK> johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while they're <UNK> one day she is <UNK> by <UNK> working for an <UNK> slave <UNK> called <UNK> played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her back br br michael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff he's helped out first by a <UNK> <UNK> against the slave trade that no one <UNK> is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william <UNK> and then by an arab called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has a score to settle with <UNK> he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get <UNK> back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his <UNK> br br then there's lots of adventure there's also lots of morality questioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but it's all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to <UNK> before peter ustinov sells her on to omar <UNK> yes of course omar <UNK> is in it
<START> i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2 3 years thanks to the <UNK> of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution i am able to <UNK> into the past of all the great star trek episodes for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart through <UNK> <UNK> voyager etc general popular <UNK> will say i like the next generation the best that's because captain <UNK> and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek <UNK> but to be quiet honest i appreciate the creativity of <UNK> episodes more than <UNK> <UNK> episodes also progresses through time unlike <UNK> granted data from <UNK> is great but it eventually gets old but <UNK> doctor now that's creativity instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined not only is <UNK> such a great actor but the premise setting for his <UNK> self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best <UNK> portray him as a husband married to an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for human machine <UNK> and even in the episode before <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> order and make human mistakes unlike <UNK> which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode voyager has to survive 3 seasons without <UNK> ryan and i believe it is <UNK> that carried them with his personality of course the rest of the <UNK> cast chemistry just flows <UNK> harry kim and tom paris very natural i love <UNK> occasional humor despite being a <UNK> finally i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain oh if you get to watch the rare footage thank god for kate she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain what a great job thank you star trek for making voyager i enjoy every episode the creative exploration of possibilities of morals and of our <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely <UNK> so for the <UNK> value i give it one otherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply <UNK> a practical jock to people who love foreign movies <UNK> the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable however the children in the movie are mostly 3 4 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life
<START> wow 5 more hours of <UNK> lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soap opera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off complete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesn't last for better or worse this <UNK> in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on <UNK> in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less <UNK> by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didn't involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points <UNK> strongly often out loud to what was going on extremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded <UNK> questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger <UNK> more spirits more bizarre <UNK> more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and it's been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his immense talent to anyone who <UNK> it playing a very difficult character anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didn't speak he was later dubbed and still <UNK> in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very hand held with rapid <UNK> and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound though these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i don't regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it's even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece <UNK> <UNK> secret hiding place of <UNK> is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more low brow more sex and <UNK> function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first mini series one would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more <UNK> than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still <UNK> plot points and items are explained away too easily a certain character living in <UNK> for no apparent reason for example anyone who's seen it knows who i'm speaking of the two <UNK> while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too <UNK> in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to <UNK> any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first though if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first <UNK> and wants more where that came from i urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i can't tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 8 10
<START> overrated and only for those people in their <UNK> whom wear particularly thick rose <UNK> glasses who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young awful animation dialogue and a tired narrative a real product of the 80's the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy thats right toy not the absurd pretentious and child <UNK> <UNK> action <UNK> sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other <UNK> only matters to those who bought the toy when they were actual children in the period of <UNK> to <UNK> it has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories avoid
<START> sure it takes place in the west but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western instead it is a movie of a woman sheriff make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff she becomes sheriff when her husband is <UNK> down she is only a tad bit upset by this her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman but the villain hires a guy to kill her so this is what happens the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa utterly stupid as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars but i guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb this movie is very boring and not really worth watching it is not one of the better episodes of <UNK> they made i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful corman is a low budget director but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another
<START> manhattan apartment <UNK> have to put up with all kinds of <UNK> the worst one is the lack of closet space some people who eat out all the time use their <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> places because the <UNK> are already full br br <UNK> frank and norman <UNK> a great comedy writing team from that era saw the potential in eric <UNK> novel whose hero jim blandings can't stand the <UNK> apartment where he and his wife muriel and two daughters must share br br jim blandings a madison <UNK> executive has had it when he sees an ad for <UNK> living he decides to take a look obviously a first time owner jim is <UNK> by the real estate man into buying the <UNK> house he is taken to <UNK> by an <UNK> agent this is only the beginning of his problems br br whatever could be wrong goes wrong the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house after the original one is <UNK> as one problem leads to another more money is necessary and whatever was going to be the original cost ends up in an <UNK> price that jim could not really afford br br the film is fun because of the three principals in it cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings myrna loy was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr grant the third character bill cole an old boyfriend of myrna turned lawyer for the blandings is suave and <UNK> the way <UNK> douglas portrayed him one of the blandings girls joan is played by <UNK> <UNK> who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint the great louise <UNK> plays <UNK> but doesn't have much to do br br the film is lovingly photographed by james wong <UNK> who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better the direction of h c potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies
<START> hey now yours truly <UNK> found this while <UNK> through videos at the flea market in almost new condition and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a cult hit so of course it came home with me br br what a strange film the aunt and cousin of former first lady <UNK> <UNK> kennedy <UNK> live in this <UNK> 28 room house out on long island <UNK> co and share the house with <UNK> cats <UNK> <UNK> and who knows what else <UNK> co was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right anyway this is one strange pair big edie and little edie edie the daughter always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little <UNK> to the camera that rarely make much sense big edie the mother age <UNK> apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was <UNK> done to the point where we're mercifully <UNK> from that these women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense except to them they live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever look that <UNK> going to the bathroom behind my portrait and one bedroom appears to be their center of <UNK> if i close my eyes and listen to big <UNK> voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that lawn <UNK> accent one scene has little edie putting on flea <UNK> lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been <UNK> the box refers to these two women as eccentric and i'd have to say in this case it is just a <UNK> for <UNK> out of their <UNK> but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them this is equal parts creepy sad and disgusting but i couldn't stop watching once i started this is not my normal type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating it won't be for everybody though guaranteed
<START> zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's <UNK> <UNK> own production company this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series though it is by no means weak overall it tells of our hero coming across two towns rival bosses and a mysterious <UNK> helping the poor and from this set up <UNK> a tale <UNK> tragedy violence and no little interest all served up with <UNK> of the <UNK> but inspired <UNK> that is one of the series <UNK> it is a fairly predictable plot and it <UNK> in <UNK> fashion but it <UNK> along with style and is interesting stuff the helpful <UNK> for example is a <UNK> <UNK> revolutionary character <UNK> the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions whilst the <UNK> system <UNK> the exploitation of the poor its a harsh world with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting though things aren't as rousing as they could be <UNK> <UNK> turns in a typical <UNK> performance as zatoichi mixing wisdom deadly skill and <UNK> with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability while solid work comes also from <UNK> <UNK> and an effectively <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> later to appear as <UNK> superior snake <UNK> in the hanzo trilogy as the two main bosses in the film there is also a good emotional turn from <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> woman the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be emotional impact is lost also the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director <UNK> <UNK> though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a <UNK> rather than really inspired way without the lively characters or strong <UNK> of some other <UNK> still i enjoyed this one it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a <UNK> satisfying dose of entertainment a good story and decent doses of <UNK> trademark ingenious and quirky cool recommended for fans of the series and a reasonable entry point classy stuff though not a true great
<START> way back in 1955 the british made a comedy called simon and laura with peter <UNK> and the brilliant kay <UNK> to this day it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and more particularly about how television sitcoms become so popular it was and is an excellent example also of self <UNK> cinema br br so also <UNK> a film i'd never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well as you know br br however i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv in fact it's been a while since i laughed so <UNK> so if you like satire i'd recommend you see it br br the main actors  sally field kevin kline robert downey and cathy <UNK>  quite simply do an excellent job revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is as i watched it i kept thinking to myself just how much of this <UNK> carries over into real life that is if actors ever do have a real life as you probably know peter sellers for example was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a <UNK> of characters so that nobody really knew the real person so as i watched sally field playing <UNK> <UNK> playing maggie i thought again about that earlier british film with kay <UNK> playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter <UNK> br br is it any wonder that some actors have nervous <UNK> and that feeling was <UNK> when <UNK> finally confronts her daughter <UNK> played by elizabeth <UNK> and in an emotional moment repeats the fictional lines she'd used on a prior episode of her daytime soap when confronting her fictional daughter in that show are you confused well it's not all like that but the dialog is stunning for originality comedy <UNK> anger <UNK> <UNK> and even love br br the story well there are many stories in this film all <UNK> and which all come together at the end of course  but not like a robert altman film okay and not all of them are resolved finally life's not like that anyway right the pace is almost frenetic and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes spend the <UNK> minutes from your life and watch it you won't regret the time usage br br the rest of the cast all perform well although i've never taken much to whoopi goldberg perhaps the funniest <UNK> are between robert downey and cathy <UNK> and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others she gets my vote as the outstanding player i kid you not she gives the term bitch an entirely new face
<START> as much as i love rodney <UNK> this was a terrible movie the plot was kind of a <UNK> rip off of various movies but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes in addition it was annoying and boring and that's being kind if you're looking for a good laugh rent a copy of private parts
<START> this is one of the most irritating nonsensical movies i've ever had the misfortune to sit through every time it started to look like it might be getting good out come more <UNK> tone flashbacks followed by paranoid idiocy <UNK> as social commentary the main character <UNK> is a manipulative would be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting but are unfortunately never developed nor do we ever really understand the john <UNK> character supposedly <UNK> <UNK> to commit the acts of rebellion at one point i thought <UNK> <UNK> is just nuts and is secretly making up all those <UNK> from escaped mental patient <UNK> now we're getting somewhere but of course that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless both from <UNK> perspective and the viewer's where's <UNK> <UNK> when we need him
<START> i just recently watched this on the sundance channel the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers <UNK> in their own country to make short films eleven of them all in one film <UNK> on just one subject september 11 br br from <UNK> this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film br br the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september 11 which they fail to realize until later br br the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover <UNK> while she is unaware of what is going as the t v plays br br the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9 11 but <UNK> in other places br br the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september 11 and believes they must march for them br br the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin <UNK> br br the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day br br the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks br br there are other films that i can't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful it will bring back your emotions from that day br br 10 10
<START> excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years starting around <UNK> he <UNK> about his boy and young <UNK> his family friends romances etc very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale all things in life come together as one and a river runs through it and that river <UNK> me worth seeing
<START> i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web i thought cinderella 2 as well as 3 is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and adults like me i am 22 years old br br i also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart i thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by brooke allison too since this film has been divided into three flashbacks stories my favorite out of the three is the story of when <UNK> the mouse became a human for a day thanks to fairy <UNK> and her magic
<START> what else can you say about this movie except that it's plain awful tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this but that's it but their talents are wasted in this junk i think that they used a double in some of <UNK> scenes like when he's running because you can't see his face if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare just think what he must've felt about appearing in this if it was before or after i'm not sure but still zombie nightmare is a classic check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last compared to this the gang is very annoying and over acting by some of the actors a rip off of the wild one starring marlon brando of course tina looks stunning though i hope her and adam got a good paycheck pass
<START> i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you haven't read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might <UNK> you to read the book which you'll probably enjoy more br br
<START> if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book please don't give up on the series i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year and already i'm almost finished with book 10 i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a <UNK> of justice while left behind the movie only vaguely follows the story of the left behind the book the characters aren't even close to accurate br br a few examples <UNK> never acts on his feelings for <UNK> he is about to when he's informed of the <UNK> buck williams is a blonde haired magazine writer not a tv reporter chloe is at <UNK> and a lot of the book details <UNK> wondering if she <UNK> buck and chloe don't meet until much later at a meeting in new york set up by <UNK> irene and <UNK> are never <UNK> the book ' rather just in <UNK> flashback thoughts the roads are so jam packed with <UNK> following the rapture that <UNK> and <UNK> have to helicopter back to the <UNK> etc etc etc br br and that's just from the first movie they're about to release the third please even if you didn't like the movies give the book series a chance
<START> bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little <UNK> which he tries to save from an <UNK> this short tries and the <UNK> is adorable but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughs department the <UNK> isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown <UNK> so i can't in good conscience recommend this one however it is nice to see it in it's uncut form this cartoon is on <UNK> 3 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 br br my grade c
<START> this was the worst movie i've ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad that's what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is <UNK> with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie <UNK> guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting br br so go watch this movie but don't buy it
<START> i loved <UNK> pfeiffer is that spelled right in <UNK> haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the <UNK> was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a <UNK> i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure br br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they <UNK> it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance <UNK>
<START> ridiculous looking little <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> themselves so far for the horror elements this movie has all the rest of <UNK> plays out like a really retarded comedy that's so stupid you won't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes i can imagine little kids cheering for these little <UNK> but adults will be left with only those supposedly smart references <UNK> to on screen stuff like capt <UNK> <UNK> entries from star trek the most well known scene from e t a blatant statement from the filmmakers going look we're <UNK> in on <UNK> success here and a cardboard cut out of clint eastwood telling us what about his western movies exactly that last one was totally lost on me oh yes and chemical waste <UNK> in <UNK> seems to be a bad thing don't know where they got that idea from br br not to say that <UNK> is the most <UNK> film to sit through for that matter it's just really really dumb and if you manage to crack a smile while watching it you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished br br good badness yes but only if dumb retarded ridiculous are <UNK> you're looking for 3 10 and well <UNK> 6 10
<START> a pretty average scifi film the plot was more or less obvious from the start although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films br br the basic plot scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been <UNK> <UNK> they find a <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> at that very moment after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the <UNK> waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship br br after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman <UNK> innocent victims overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter which i didn't consider to be a good film either br br not a good film get aliens out and watch that again br br
<START> this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot aside from the lack of plot the acting was atrocious the special effects were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are <UNK> crappy dialogue i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about it's now a running joke among my friends and i 1 out of 10
<START> in what seemed like the longest <UNK> 35 i've had to endure in a long time al pacino delivers an accurate <UNK> to be sure not his usual <UNK> which was nice but his character was just <UNK> pathetic someone to <UNK> as he stumbles around forgetting <UNK> as we realise that the hollywood social life has <UNK> him of his life energy but in this movie we needed someone to like and for some reason every character in the picture said i don't know why i like you eli to al <UNK> <UNK> and i couldn't even come close to liking him br br all the other actors played their usual styles tea <UNK> richard <UNK> and bill <UNK> did nothing to change their established <UNK> developed on tv or in earlier films and kim basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind br br the movie's story had no momentum most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting <UNK> about characters which later came into play in an anti climactic ending it had potential except for their <UNK> to build upon the story br br whats the point of the film daniel <UNK> and jon robin <UNK> would have you believe once hollywood has you you can't get out yeah right and that's why so many people get fired in hollywood
<START> a blockbuster at the time of it's original release it was the second highest <UNK> film of 1976 the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike the film open to <UNK> negative reviews however 5 6 million budgeted picture went on to gross over 150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden <UNK> it's not without some irony that <UNK> most <UNK> successful film would also remain her most controversial for every ten fans who state that star is <UNK> best film there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography although both sides have some merit to support their claims it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining <UNK> dramas that hollywood ever produced for my money it's the best version of the often told tale br br the film is <UNK> enjoyable and <UNK> absorbing changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the <UNK> world of the music industry was actually a great idea and the screenplay <UNK> a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses it's classic predecessors for example the film is especially successful when depicting the <UNK> personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never ending phone calls that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> attempts this version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters for example the female leads in the two previous versions were so <UNK> and self <UNK> that they came off as saints on the other hand esther the female lead in this version is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate but also flawed and conflicted this makes her feel more real than the janet <UNK> or judy garland characters felt in the previous films and makes the story that much more effective br br the performances are all on target even if some of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough if you're looking for an actress singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script <UNK> streisand is definitely the girl you want she's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural and as usual she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer simply put her esther is a fully realized three dimensional human being kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid back characterization however he's always interesting watch and displays a <UNK> charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from <UNK> time and even the new <UNK> usually vicious pauline <UNK> gary busey and paul <UNK> also give believable performances but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time br br the film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success hitting the 1 on <UNK> hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone the streisand composed <UNK> with lyrics from paul williams is <UNK> one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop brought to even further life by an absolutely <UNK> vocal performance from streisand the rest of the film's original songs mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes are pretty good as well and streisand sounds fantastic her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded <UNK> vibrant performances bring woman in the moon and with one more look at you to thrilling life and make even <UNK> numbers like queen <UNK> work far better than they have the right to <UNK> solo numbers sound somewhat <UNK> however that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline br br though naturally dated in some respects it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well the film is well <UNK> and <UNK> produced the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both <UNK> effective in conclusion a star is born is not only entertaining and moving but it also <UNK> all criticism
<START> i bought this at tower records after seeing the info <UNK> about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over 1 500 dvd's with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin
<START> this is an excellent modern day film noir excellent in that it's interesting start to finish there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief but i haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story the movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters in addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack br br i labeled this crime movie a film noir because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good even the only supposed good guy played by nicholas cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he <UNK> have he also does something at the end which isn't right but i'm not going the spoil it by saying suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good br br speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than dennis hopper not many at least in the deranged category he's tough to beat lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons j t walsh gives another great supporting performance too br br this is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have you'll have fun watching this by the way try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up
<START> having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly i thought lion king 1 5 might be worth watching what a disappointment disney must be getting desperate for <UNK> br br especially now that they lost the deal with pixar br br basically they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the <UNK> floor or garbage can and glued them together to make a br br quick buck unlike <UNK> i ii both of which had strong story lines br br this movie hardly has a story at all while the characters and animation are always fun to look at there is simply not enough material here for a movie some of the bits could have been good 2nd <UNK> <UNK> on the original offerings br br disney shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck br br next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work
<START> this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a <UNK> in love with his <UNK> <UNK> out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a <UNK> <UNK> of plots with liberal <UNK> from boogie nights thelma and louise <UNK> <UNK> and even a curious dash of 400 blows thrown in towards the end at least the director did his research the result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything however the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind the scenes world of gay porn br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> walt disney i wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first a silly padded storyline terrible over acting by glenn close who <UNK> up every scene as though she's playing for her own amusement and incredibly <UNK> and uninteresting lead actors once more the dogs are the only actors that seem real and thats a stretch another wasted effort here grade d
<START> it's official folks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have a thought in his pretty little head are you wondering why he chose <UNK> <UNK> as his <UNK> br br <UNK> or is that <UNK> doesn't appear in this one instead we get a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> apparently a pop star in japan judging by her song at the end she's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> and a wasted <UNK> <UNK> typically an <UNK> of quality who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a <UNK> asian <UNK> and is too old to manage even that br br <UNK> philosophy life is <UNK> a big nothing feel it and move on i'd like to do that but <UNK> gives us nothing to feel in <UNK> <UNK> beyond a bland photo <UNK> of life in tokyo circa 2003 and the <UNK> observation that people are ships that pass in the night no make that trains that pass in the day never connecting each <UNK> to its own destination usually some <UNK> of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they're lucky <UNK> flowers of shanghai is one of the most <UNK> technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time how could the same director who created the opening shot of that film which features about twelve actors <UNK> at machine gun speed for about ten straight minutes an impossible directorial feat get trapped making this <UNK> sub <UNK> reality porn for two films in a row now millennium <UNK> may be dead weight but at least it has two great shots shots that hint at <UNK> true calling as the film equivalent of <UNK> <UNK> those shots are the sex scene with the <UNK> <UNK> lights and the opening shot of <UNK> <UNK> floating down a blue <UNK> his m o while making <UNK> <UNK> seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium <UNK> to make it more consistent you be the judge if that sounds appealing br br <UNK> does not need to <UNK> you cannot <UNK> the <UNK> idea further than flowers of shanghai he needs to expand to <UNK> <UNK> to release the inner <UNK> and genre <UNK> that is being <UNK> so <UNK> on clichéd <UNK> it's time for him to do a live action remake of <UNK> or something this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held <UNK> in long shot and speak in <UNK> is now every last bit as safe <UNK> and <UNK> as the hollywood action blockbuster what is the connection between reality and people who can't talk it seems to me that people in real life never stop <UNK> then again considering that 2005 alone brought big budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as <UNK> <UNK> the island and king kong it's now safe to say that even michael bay has <UNK> <UNK> and that's really sad br br the good news is that though <UNK> is in his 50s it frankly feels to me as if he hasn't even begun there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there such as a moody bit early on in the <UNK> when the room <UNK> to a bloody sunset red while <UNK> talks about babies with the faces of <UNK> but whatever fear is holding him back however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be <UNK> by the <UNK> and pretentious as the <UNK> of cinema <UNK> your time as the darling of the <UNK> <UNK> toronto berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your <UNK> double quick two words for you <UNK> <UNK> two more words or maybe three <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you are now <UNK> from both of these tedious <UNK> who are about to go up their own dark <UNK> forever risk your shirt on a sci fi epic sell out be <UNK> but leave the social <UNK> to people that have no eye and no heart let your <UNK> talent express itself to the full you're not going to ever get out of <UNK> otherwise
<START> i <UNK> this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii <UNK> village world of gays and lesbians with the exception of stewart and novak the <UNK> and witches represented that alternative lifestyle john van <UNK> who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this <UNK> village i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell book and candle in the theater when i was in <UNK> or <UNK> grade just because my parents took me it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses machine guns or alien monsters and i planned on being bored but i remember the moment when jimmy stewart <UNK> kim novak on the top of the <UNK> building and <UNK> his hat away while the camera followed it <UNK> to the ground as the glorious george <UNK> love theme <UNK> i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love the first <UNK> of romantic sexual love left me <UNK> as i left the theater i am sure i'm not the only pre adolescent boy who was <UNK> by kim <UNK> startling direct <UNK> it's ironic that a gay <UNK> was able to jump start <UNK> <UNK> in so many of us i am in my late 50's now and re watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings <UNK> as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later
<START> review in english since swedish is not allowed br br i saw this movie with extremely low expectations and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them br br as much as i loved to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the <UNK> process that seven people falling into the water isn't original or funny the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that ain't is just plain boring i <UNK> like three times during the entire film br br the placement of swedish <UNK> products is unintentionally funny why not just a big sign saying <UNK> made it happen br br <UNK> <UNK> 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd just wait for it to air on tv it wont take too long
<START> in my life i have seen many great and awful movies i am not an expert in professional reviews but i have definitely something to say about this one firstly these actors are the worst i have seen their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the dvd in the first 2 minutes i think that these actors were not interested in the quality br br another awful thing is about these dialogs they are so lame you sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them it seems that your 14 year old son could act better i feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old european car br br please if my message reaches you save your time and money
<START> flavia the <UNK> is a strange entry in the <UNK> genre equal parts sleaze <UNK> journey and history as we follow flavia on her strange trip br br we start off with flavia in a convent she ain't too happy there <UNK> she doesn't believe in all the male dominated rules and macho <UNK> of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal abraham they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another non believing nun in <UNK> a <UNK> invasion flavia hangs out with the <UNK> who take over the convent and get busy with the nuns in a strange set of scenes eventually the <UNK> roll out and flavia is <UNK> as a <UNK> to christianity in another <UNK> brutal scene br br this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film some good gore including <UNK> <UNK> and a nice leg <UNK> scene some decent nudity including the requisite full frontal and a decent storyline as well i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points but not enough to get truly bored with it i would definitely recommend this one to <UNK> 70's exploit fans 8 10
<START> <UNK> the vampire in <UNK> is a rubbish the acting is terrible the atmosphere is non existent and the characters are uninteresting the only scary thing about this piece of <UNK> is that majority of the imdb users gave it a 10 this is really horrifying no gore no suspense no violence nothing bruce <UNK> the evil dead intruder is completely wasted the supporting cast is also terrible yes some people may like this picture especially a mainstream society but hard core horror fans or gore <UNK> won't enjoy this piece of crap personally i hate horror comedies i prefer watching serious horror movies like cannibal holocaust or last house on the left in my opinion a real horror movie is supposed to be scary <UNK> bloody and disturbing without stupid humour which usually ruins the whole concept this one isn't scary isn't gory isn't even funny as a comedy so don't waste your precious time
<START> a thief in the night is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low budget which was obvious and its subject matter the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind nevertheless it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ it touched everyone showing even a <UNK> who <UNK> the word but did not believe it knowing exactly why he was left behind this movie and its sequel distant thunder are must see movies even with the new left behind series coming out telling the same story with a much higher budget the impact is still the same a thief in the night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered
<START> first off i didn't know what to expect when i started the video br br anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and <UNK> it into the present something gets inexplicably lost in the translation br br that's not the case here this movie just starts off on the right track it's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well <UNK> scene anyone that has to be seen and just try and keep a straight face this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it <UNK> into a modern production it's good to see someone is filling the need in this market very well done br br
<START> i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent br br new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human <UNK> most powerful emotion br br the cast is huge a <UNK> <UNK> 11 with andy garcia ethan hawke <UNK> <UNK> natalie portman <UNK> cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or another br br that's not to mention that there is a who's who of directors <UNK> stories in clever and interesting ways brett <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> natalie portman i mean wow this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but that's good in my opinion go see it for yourself and <UNK> to my review i want to hear what others have to say
<START> i caught this movie late at night on cable and i was pleasantly surprised i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known is because the subject matter is very disturbing but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic it is a well acted suspenseful and very interesting movie both richard gere and claire <UNK> are very good in it and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart the movie doesn't go out of its way to be brutal either like <UNK> for instance br br i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies
<START> this is an very good movie this is one that i would rent over and over again it is not like your normal superhero movie this movie <UNK> comedy action and great special effects it even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on the simpsons william h macy is the bomb
<START> we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release for it quickly became one of our family favorites the kids are now teens and must have seen it a <UNK> <UNK> times yet they still watch it <UNK> with friends it's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups similar to grease br br vanessa williams is spectacular jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet i've noticed other <UNK> on this site are pretty rough on him but our family gives him top ratings we loved his <UNK> <UNK> number marc <UNK> as conrad supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers and <UNK> <UNK> as ursula just flat steals the show probably our favorite character in the entire movie br br the one disappointment was <UNK> <UNK> performance of kim part of that has to do with the writing <UNK> role is completely one dimensional <UNK> that <UNK> delivery is flat unimaginative unbelievable and just plain awful the director should have seen that and <UNK> it or never cast her to begin with br br overall though the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages
<START> i knew that <UNK> was a <UNK> film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked <UNK> on imdb had said that it was a <UNK> <UNK> but that your companion would survive br br survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for <UNK> it is supposed to be <UNK> or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide <UNK> and a lawn but no apparent <UNK> if that sort of thing <UNK> you it might seem quite a short film br br there's a monty python film about a knight who just won't die he ends up a <UNK> why do <UNK> add an third <UNK> to this word i wonder <UNK> in the road still shouting <UNK> at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave <UNK> shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she's not worried about having been a wide eyed breathless bimbo but <UNK> herself a <UNK> br br obviously being a <UNK> film there's a <UNK> who is supposed to be the mr <UNK> <UNK> character i'm not a <UNK> so i can't claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious <UNK> who is <UNK> out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he's a <UNK> cypher br br as you might gather the main characters aren't much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is <UNK> fair enough but it isn't the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a <UNK> film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face <UNK> didn't <UNK> him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a <UNK> because he looked worse without it br br i kept awake by <UNK> which actors and actresses had their <UNK> attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if you're dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach <UNK> br br apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you'd have thought that they'd have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby but we do as the audience if they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about <UNK> shouting for him i suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence br br another scenery item that caught my attention was a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties
<START> it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive <UNK> like character of russians or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country that it is too easy to rob a bank in england and that british police is so <UNK> that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air in addition nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by aliens in the <UNK> mountains but far to be the russian one so nicole if you really want to talk russian kindly go to <UNK> or st <UNK> and keep yourself busy learning russian language <UNK> and its <UNK>
<START> minor spoiler br br underrated little stephen king shocker it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination even if the limp performances of <UNK> <UNK> and denise crosby were better <UNK> still be the <UNK> mystical story elements to <UNK> with the old <UNK> burial ground <UNK> <UNK> ill sister and the <UNK> <UNK> an victor <UNK> never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and <UNK> but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its <UNK> to shock pet <UNK> may actually be one of the <UNK> horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> it's politically incorrect it's tasteless it's gratuitous and yet it makes us <UNK> with <UNK> in a way <UNK> horror movies never can add to that one of fred <UNK> best performances and mary <UNK> witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie even with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans 7 5 out of 10
<START> <UNK> godfather pulp fiction all good films great films but nothing and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all santa claus br br the film is so great and has so many messages i cried while watching it seriously this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream we see the sadness in his eyes and we feel the deep sorrow and then we wonder what is so bad about this ice cream is it <UNK> that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil think movie makes you think br br this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever unlike other <UNK> he is a normal person we see him <UNK> children and <UNK> on kids dreams and we wonder is the santa we believe in really that good also this santa actually mentions christ the whole meaning behind christmas br br you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24 7 whether it's christmas or not this movie gets a 500 10 whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool
<START> br br i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast one of the ones we got at hollywood video was this one zombie bloodbath this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual br br the story is about a <UNK> project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers <UNK> and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombies br br from this point on it's <UNK> city the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll br br ok it's not great art but this one with it's in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan <UNK> he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip
<START> i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989 i enjoyed it then and i still do now but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven burt reynolds and dom <UNK> work wonderfully together and <UNK> singing voice is appropriate for a <UNK> dog there are some good songs ranging from upbeat let's make music together to downright emotional home to my heart i found the plot good although it does go off on a <UNK> once or twice the final scene of the film with charlie and anne marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation a film worth experiencing
<START> note i will reveal a key part of the plot but if you've looked at the dvd cover or any <UNK> material you'll already know it br br this movie seems to have been written by an eleven year old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it the writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an <UNK> br br forget the fact the the un and the <UNK> seem to be running the show in <UNK> forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear not even <UNK> these are <UNK> in the context of this movie in the scientific world within this story 2 2 6 <UNK> and gravity goes <UNK> br br the fact is that the people in this movie do not with a few exceptions behave the way human beings behave almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate the love story of course there is one makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare br br i can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing
<START> an unoriginal overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something and in of all places surprise surprise <UNK> br br the film features james <UNK> and an almost <UNK> supporting cast with the exception of carl lewis who's actually not that bad for a non actor who deliver ho hum performances that do little to <UNK> the <UNK> unimaginative dialogue to make things worse the film's pace is slow there's almost no subplot and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd what is a wonder is why <UNK> an excellent actor at times who won the cannes best actor award for sex lies and <UNK> and did a splendid job in the innovative sci fi flick <UNK> chose to sign onto this lackluster project or maybe not if you look at his career for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits br br the most remarkable thing about alien <UNK> is how they managed to <UNK> in so many elements from so many great sci fi films and still have the thing turn out so <UNK> and contrived there are huge borrowed bits from the <UNK> both howard <UNK> original and john carpenter's excellent 1982 remake <UNK> and <UNK> a few hints of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> kubrick's <UNK> i e the alien black <UNK> and mission to <UNK> i e the mystery message and even a little dash of <UNK> and a remarkable <UNK> although not sci fi films they share a <UNK> connection hell there's even <UNK> and <UNK> just like the recent x files <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was <UNK> from an <UNK> from the <UNK> br br its all been done before and done a whole lot better although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end i could say a little bit more about the plot but there's absolutely no need you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it 5 out of 10
<START> this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever i'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote they keep changing the script to <UNK> the person they're <UNK> i could not get out of the theatre fast enough when i saw it at that year's toronto film festival please never see this film
<START> crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart mostly known for directing john <UNK> wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty something friends in a small town in england all three professional women down out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> included with endless <UNK> of their dates <UNK> behavior or the needs of their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> once again thrown by the <UNK> of the british which is where i find she exudes the most is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a <UNK> school who becomes involved with a younger man small town <UNK> and the <UNK> jealous friends great supporting cast conflicts with her relationship unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that this is the type of film you either love or hate which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released as i'm sure most are just <UNK> the film now i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as love actually and three <UNK> and a funeral not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments
<START> barbra streisand in 1964 was still a curiosity and probably raised more than a few industry <UNK> when cbs signed her to 10 year 5 million television deal nothing these days but more important than that barbra and her manager insisted on creative control and got it she had this special filmed her way and for the most part her vision was by turns clever <UNK> and incredible opening act i with the title song not written specifically for her streisand races through a classy cast of songs linked with i'm late from alice in wonderland she even keeps in the line about fuzzy ears and <UNK> and too much time to <UNK> this is a totally charming if not bizarre selection and enjoy it because it didn't make the two soundtrack albums released she slows down for make believe which gets perhaps too slow but the dramatic how does the wine taste is amazing a kid again is cute with streisand looking tiny in a huge chair is that where lily <UNK> got the idea as is sweet <UNK> i'm an alligator crocodile no alligator where is the wonder is very cool and elegant and her people number surrounded by an orchestra who tap for her at the <UNK> close is stunning act ii is set in new york city's <UNK> goodman with streisand acting <UNK> in high fashion get ups when she <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> the audience watching the tape actually <UNK> act iii before a studio audience made up of lucky fan club <UNK> begins with a powerful version of when the sun comes out streisand actually looks out of breath at the dramatic close followed by why did i choose you probably her best early song a too quick lover come back to me where she's ultimately drowned out by the orchestra and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the finale happy days are here again which reportedly took 12 takes <UNK> the hour in amazing fashion <UNK> by <UNK> a <UNK> making company this black and white gem moves fast with <UNK> set ups terrific cinematography <UNK> sets and costumes they really don't make 'em like this anymore and that <UNK> to the special and to la streisand
<START> after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come <UNK> i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be i've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot the ending is very anti climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with in my opinion a waste of time
<START> shot into car from through the <UNK> someone is playing someone else their latest song someone else didn't react according to the voice over i just wonder how that came to be made there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there if the scenes shot where the warhols <UNK> on a <UNK> post party are true then that was <UNK> exploitation to the max if not then it was a total <UNK> either way it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about taken at face value a nice portrait of the tortured genius we all believe ourselves to be
<START> bill <UNK> <UNK> than rare <UNK> movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash <UNK> that have become so essential of its counterparts the <UNK> this time around uses <UNK> and small arms as well as an awesome array of <UNK> weapons a sin that's virtually <UNK> in most post halloween genre pieces but there's still just enough <UNK> to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never <UNK> too far from the path that you've grown to expect just as <UNK> <UNK> surprisingly decent <UNK> was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family <UNK> seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous <UNK> listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy <UNK> br br it all takes place in the middle of the <UNK> which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any <UNK> john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of <UNK> and <UNK> that always seems to rub homicidal <UNK> the wrong way chris jennifer <UNK> and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin <UNK> and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the <UNK> like wilderness <UNK> older brother kyle todd <UNK> and his <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> laura albert soon turn up to join the body count <UNK> in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with <UNK> windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his <UNK> will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel br br i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don't even know if director bill <UNK> is aka william <UNK>  the man behind midnight fear and <UNK> among others <UNK> certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is <UNK> photographed with some superb work from <UNK> michael <UNK> and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary r christopher <UNK> gore fx are <UNK> created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the <UNK> who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually <UNK> 18 rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a <UNK> while another ends up literally <UNK> after <UNK> a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey i didn't quite know what to expect thankfully <UNK> knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho <UNK> chris <UNK> br br there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer <UNK> does a superb job as the heroine and b g <UNK> portrays off his rocker <UNK> with <UNK> the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it <UNK> doesn't come at the cost of <UNK> potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and <UNK> by hollywood <UNK> watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it's <UNK> br br <UNK> is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding <UNK> gold in your coffee <UNK> than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended
<START> this drama is unlike sex and the city where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other its much more personal and people can relate to it its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like sex and the city <UNK> jungle br br dr katie <UNK> is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while <UNK> his son's advances on her her <UNK> clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well br br <UNK> <UNK> a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9 11 and when a handsome stranger richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business the ridiculous and embarrassing <UNK> scenes between richard and <UNK> are totally funny it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9 11 board for her husband's death lets see what his intentions are br br <UNK> dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making as they are having trouble <UNK> and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or <UNK> up with her husband played by <UNK> jeffrey jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she <UNK> a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague lets see where her character venture to br br the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and <UNK> are shown its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe
<START> this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an <UNK> that is in financial trouble when the director goes on vacation his dad agrees to step in <UNK> to run things br br this is positively the best work that leslie <UNK> has ever done his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh br br the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie br br such great family entertainment is so rare these days if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings go for this one i could watch this over and over and i often do my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy
<START> <UNK> course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate <UNK> movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a <UNK> jay leno can act he's good in his underrated debut movie the <UNK> in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad <UNK> character a <UNK> <UNK> is less annoying than <UNK> character a <UNK> fool
<START> 1st watched 12 6 2009 4 out of 10 <UNK> walter lang disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this much <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> piece there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the king of <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to <UNK> to teach the children about <UNK> european things we find out later that the king is actually the biggest <UNK> there is a side forbidden romance between the king's <UNK> wife played by rita <UNK> a latino as an arab come on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though deborah kerr as the main female character annie is ok but not that convincing either the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does this is really a <UNK> story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really
<START> steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the <UNK> remake of the out of <UNK> this movie falls flat on it's face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack <UNK> wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan <UNK> could have played the <UNK> part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work it's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers <UNK> acknowledge the total lack of <UNK> by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real <UNK> get hold of the original episodes of the phil <UNK> show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened
<START> it's 1978 and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well fans will be upset and certainly the 75 000 seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable it's not much more but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom <UNK> unfortunately any goodness <UNK> brings to the screen is quickly <UNK> by actors like dick <UNK> br br it's a silly story about super bowl <UNK> <UNK> jackson is charged by new york read mafia for <UNK> the game ends for their favor in this case a 10 000 000 bet <UNK> is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the <UNK> <UNK> takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isn't known for certain but is revealed rather <UNK> at the final murder that <UNK> is the new antagonist br br it's a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you'll survive br br 2 10 maybe a 2 5
<START> just saw the world <UNK> of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it here we have a welcome <UNK> of a genre widely thought to have been <UNK> certainly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and successfully by george romero but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it's a comedy and yes i actually think it is better than <UNK> of the <UNK> thoroughly believable and perhaps even more importantly enjoyable performances by dylan baker carrie anne moss and young actor <UNK> ray whom i suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features however i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as <UNK> mr <UNK> essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van <UNK> from the corpse bride or for those who've seen the film wouldn't that read even better here as the corpse pride and of course <UNK> actor billy connolly in his least animated yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character just think he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter <UNK> <UNK> to prison break as was revealed in the q a following <UNK> <UNK> screening i can't help but <UNK> that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the <UNK> zombie <UNK> i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won't start now suffice it to say that fido is not one of those <UNK> <UNK> gory zombie films you can rely on from romero rather it is a film that will have you constantly <UNK> and although and i did have to think back carefully to be sure there is a fair dose of blood letting and violence the <UNK> humour so well enhanced by the surreal <UNK> created by director <UNK> and his co screenwriters goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg 13 i urge you to go see this little <UNK> gem i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer
<START> well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype from the buzz at the toronto film festival to <UNK> reviews on cbc radio a refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently i'd been looking forward to it for months br br how can i put it this simply it sucked in a very big way an exercise in cinematic <UNK> that makes adam sandler look like a comic genius br br at best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing an <UNK> script badly directed and <UNK> edited into a <UNK> mess br br and what was with the music being <UNK> <UNK> than the rest of the sound track that was about the only truly odd thing about it br br if you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try <UNK> there is no comparison
<START> i love seth green his appearances on that <UNK> show is always worth watching but last night i felt the show needed to <UNK> four single young guys <UNK> a new york city apartment that most of us would die for the grandmother must have been an <UNK> to have such space in the first place so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up there did not seem to be much humor in it i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning <UNK> night i think they should go back <UNK> this series and start over we need more family involved series how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the <UNK> after a fire burns their place down they could have <UNK> coleman play the father and christine <UNK> play the mother and dysfunctional siblings the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it
<START> back in the 1970s <UNK> ran the adventures of superman every <UNK> afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while we'd get a treat when they would <UNK> <UNK> shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really was br br it wasn't bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george <UNK> superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the <UNK> padding used to make him look more <UNK> being <UNK> visible and true the mole men's costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a <UNK> covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year old since the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and badly <UNK> fabric badly <UNK> into <UNK> costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomings br br no what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from <UNK> a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the <UNK> man the creatures are <UNK> again he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot luke benson the town's <UNK> <UNK> shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to <UNK> the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of them br br that said both george reeves and <UNK> <UNK> played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with
<START> two years ago i watched the <UNK> in cinema and i loved everything about this movie obviously i was totally under impression of pierce <UNK> magnificent role yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper now i can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just <UNK> love it because of one man br br brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hit man who has no friends soon julian meets danny wright greg kinnear in mexico city man who's got bad luck his son died in accident his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife bean hope davis br br i always liked movies like this crime movie with big touch of humor mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about <UNK> with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a <UNK> hooker on a sunday morning after the <UNK> left town brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his <UNK> as usually i also like greg <UNK> american <UNK> kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wright br br so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever he'll make you smile and admire him at the same time great brosnan in not equally great movie
<START> after <UNK> his <UNK> in the giallo pool with the masterful film the strange vice of mrs <UNK> 1971 director sergio martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another <UNK> suspense thriller the case of the <UNK> tail like his earlier effort this one stars handsome macho dude george hilton who would go on to star in <UNK> satanic giallo hybrid all the colors of the dark the following year <UNK> tail also features the actors <UNK> <UNK> and anita <UNK> who would go on to portray an unhappy couple to put it mildly in <UNK> your vice is a locked room and only i have the key 1972 i just love that title i suppose <UNK> <UNK> was busy the month they shot this anyway this film boasts the stylish direction that martino fans would expect as well as a <UNK> plot some finely done murder set pieces and beautiful <UNK> location shooting the story this time concerns an insurance investigator hilton and a journalist <UNK> here looking like farrah <UNK> <UNK> smarter sister who become <UNK> in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of 1 million by a beautiful widow i really thought i had this picture figured out halfway through but i was dead wrong although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo i may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties highlights of the picture for me were <UNK> cat and mouse struggle with the killer at the end a particularly suspenseful house break in and a nifty fight <UNK> a <UNK> roof lots of good action bursts in this movie the fine folks at no shame are to be <UNK> for still another great looking dvd with nice <UNK> and interesting extras <UNK> great outfit it's turned out to be in its ongoing quest to bring these lost italian gems back from oblivion
<START> may contain minor spoilers br br dressed to kill having just seen it for the first time the other day is a movie with some terrific sequences some decent performances and a nice though obvious hitchcock ripoff plot twist at the end it's just too bad certain things quite obvious prevent it from being a classic br br dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has <UNK> at least two women could have been more but the movie never tells us and the search for the killer by three people a <UNK> kid whose mom was a victim a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer and a psychiatrist whose patient was the <UNK> <UNK> kid's mother there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz angie <UNK> as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller and micheal caine as doctor <UNK> elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye though by no standard is anyone really outstanding on the other hand denis <UNK> later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show <UNK> blue is embarrassing as an over exaggerated ruthless hateful detective though he takes little screen time so it doesn't hurt the movie that much keith gordon the brain child is decent but is almost too smart to really be believable br br what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done as is the later sequence leading to her <UNK> death i also love the sequence at the doctor's office that reveals the identity of the killer which really makes the whole film come together at once and there's a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic still there's another situation when liz is on a train running from what may be the killer that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes as a thriller it's tense and quite often believable as a crime drama it often <UNK> especially with the <UNK> ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end there's also a needless and way too long dream sequence at the end in which they had the <UNK> to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time this was an up and down experience one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with <UNK> and the next would make me <UNK> and ask why at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film br br scary movie fans should like this it still stands as a better film than most of today's slasher flicks maybe it was a better film in it's time but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone
<START> pros nothing br br cons everything br br plot summary a female reporter runs into a <UNK> that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies br br review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks <UNK> is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame <UNK> actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid <UNK> like a sexually <UNK> disease br br my last 2 cents <UNK> enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a <UNK> movie like this br br my rating 1 out of 10 if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative <UNK>
<START> may and her husband go to visit their children and <UNK> the visit is awkward because the <UNK> and kids don't really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner <UNK> husband says he doesn't feel well blames it on his daughter's cooking and <UNK> says he wants to go home he dies that night br br may now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone <UNK> for years she had something to do with her days br br she is depressed and <UNK> she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mother's arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of <UNK> may seems <UNK> and surprised yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i'm your mother and i love you what does really say i've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are <UNK> though they show it very differently br br paula has been involved with a friend of her son's darren who is a <UNK> working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and <UNK> with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their <UNK> son <UNK> but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife br br may becomes attracted to darren because he is <UNK> and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys <UNK> as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of <UNK> <UNK> that what she is doing is okay br br at a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on <UNK> face as she <UNK> the one time ghastly <UNK> br br eventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex br br this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in <UNK> ways <UNK> will be divided at one point during <UNK> writing group may reveals through a short <UNK> that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for <UNK> after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband br br clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends so she didn't have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see <UNK> actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover br br paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother br br it is a well done film with more <UNK> than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps <UNK> reactions it is a film worth discussing and <UNK> and above all worth seeing br br one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed <UNK> by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness <UNK> a sense of dread in most of us is <UNK>
<START> i recommend families if possible to show this to older children only some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle now that thats out of the way let me explain about this movie this is in reality a documentary of a male fox who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score is breath taking you had better <UNK> in as much of the scenery as possible it'll get ugly later they gave both the fox and the <UNK> names but i can't remember what they are for the likes of me he fights off this <UNK> male to win her love they later on create a <UNK> and the <UNK> gives birth to four adorable <UNK> one of which is blind there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon the first victim is the blind <UNK> who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away the second victim is the mother who while stealing <UNK> is <UNK> by a dead chicken hanging on a pole she <UNK> walks into a foot trap while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot causing her to bleed to death the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree the male is now a single dad forced to take on the roll of mom and dad he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life it later proves not to be enough when two of the now grown <UNK> meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the <UNK> and <UNK> of man i won't spoil the surprising ending for you but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early 1980s when we had a thing called <UNK> cable i was only 4 when i saw it but i could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it now i know why after i secretly watched it when it came on disney when i was 9 i felt emotionally <UNK> after seeing all this evil going on i was moved to tears but as dark and ugly as it was it serves a purpose to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals and why they are <UNK> this documentary wanted to get the message across about this <UNK> species and i hoped it worked its not fake like the true life nature films by disney they don't teach about why animals are going <UNK> the <UNK> of land the killing off of the <UNK> main prey and senseless killing of these beautiful animals has resulted in them becoming <UNK> i wish they would make sequel to this movie <UNK> fox 2005 to see if they're being treated better maybe have it be about a <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> and her siblings growing up this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes especially when one of the parents suddenly dies the surviving parent takes on the roll of both and tries to teach the important lessons of life it isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults especially when some of their lives becomes ruined or they fall victims to tragedy themselves best all around soundtrack and musical score i've ever heard
<START> i remember this movie from when i was 12 it was amazing i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then i have even tried to buy it but its like <UNK> horse sh t anyway the acting is a bit <UNK> but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch i must have watched it about 20 times it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants if your a real sci fi movie fan then watch this if it was re made today it would be a winner i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it
<START> this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you i've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either <UNK> or child <UNK> and their <UNK> remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie the realism of the movie and it's performance by <UNK> <UNK> is not to be missed the very nature of it's almost <UNK> effect will cause people to leave the theater either <UNK> or questioning their very identity bravo on the next level of cinema
<START> 'the luzhin <UNK> is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the <UNK> craft shines through it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along marlene <UNK> could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others br br adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her mother comes across a <UNK> <UNK> by the mother rather than a dramatic <UNK> in the film i felt that i was put through <UNK> torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality <UNK> however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one
<START> br br paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one he became a joke on himself once again we have a film which includes sex and violence <UNK> <UNK> at women and lots of <UNK> talk between the characters and <UNK> pans br br its all for nothing because their is no action at all in this film it <UNK> all its set pieces all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film in other words rampant over acting on almost every level starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited in this scientists are acting the same way sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset br br one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin <UNK> character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> walk and talk why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all think <UNK> all the different things that could have been done with this concept both in terms of story and characterisation then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and <UNK> the whole project really was br br more insulting is the <UNK> on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius well one out of two <UNK> that bad br br this film has nothing of note in it just like the title says br br hollow
<START> this movie is worth watching if you enjoy <UNK> over special effects there are some interesting visuals br br aside from that it's typical nineties <UNK> hollywood fare of <UNK> without substance true to the title br br it's not worth picking apart the story that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur there's not much there to begin with it's nothing original and not very special so don't go in for the story at all just look at the effects br br as has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end <UNK> the <UNK> of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard <UNK> it's a sight to behold or not to behold br br all in all it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone
<START> if there was a god he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was <UNK> up this is by far the worst vampire movie i have ever seen i may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie it makes zombie lake look like the sound of music
<START> an <UNK> <UNK> a dirty little boy actually a midget prostitutes <UNK> a violent <UNK> in a dive a motel for sexual <UNK> scantily clad babes with <UNK> a lot a <UNK> falling down the stairs a <UNK> mixed <UNK> in a bar with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> treated equally does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall wrong these are all scenes from a 1933 musical br br the first half of <UNK> parade is <UNK> for a musical <UNK> which <UNK> the last half of the film <UNK> kent cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his <UNK> wife as a result of talking pictures <UNK> out live stage musicals his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day john wayne in the big trail before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue shorts news <UNK> serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the <UNK> live musical business kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley could it be that <UNK> character is <UNK> after berkeley could be br br in <UNK> for the <UNK> kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival he <UNK> the <UNK> fires him then <UNK> to him a new <UNK> is planted in the form a dazzling <UNK> his assistant <UNK> <UNK> joan blondell soon to be mrs dick powell has the <UNK> for kent and is determined to expose the <UNK> of the <UNK> a new singer from <UNK> college shows up in the form of <UNK> <UNK> dick powell who turns out to be a real find and is paired with <UNK> thorn ruby keeler the resulting three prologue musicals which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over <UNK> years ago honeymoon hotel by a <UNK> and shanghai <UNK> br br of special note is the song and dance of tough guy james cagney like fred astaire and bill <UNK> robinson <UNK> dancing appeared natural and <UNK> although hours went into practice to get each step just right not as good a singer as astaire <UNK> singing like <UNK> sounded natural unlike the <UNK> so popular at the time it's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney br br most critics prefer the shanghai <UNK> segment over the other two yet the <UNK> choreography of by a <UNK> is astonishing how berkeley was able to film the underwater <UNK> and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must see the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color br br though not nearly as socially conscious as gold <UNK> of 1933 <UNK> parade stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen
<START> it is not un common to see u s re makes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face but here is the flip side this is an awful re make of the u s movie wide awake by the british br br wide awake is strange but entertaining and funny liam on the other hand is just strange i must give credit to liam for one thing and that is making it clear that i made the right choice in changing my religion
<START> most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good and bad sci fi movies in hollywood but long before that he was <UNK> out generic thrillers in his native land the story is a basic femme fatale premise nothing new or enthralling verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences which instead of defining our main character and his situation are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot the screenplay was solid the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting <UNK> <UNK> was amazing as the tortured artist and the supporters were very good as well also jan de <UNK> cinematography adds at least some life to the film helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director br br 6 5 10 br br 1 2
<START> i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this <UNK> and thoroughly average biopic but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any <UNK> details of his life and just gave us a forgettable <UNK> of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s
<START> as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie it was the all round bollywood action comedy movie it is a imitation of bad boys obviously the whole <UNK> identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh <UNK> needed govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date he shines as the side kick <UNK> delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema br br the songs the songs are both funny and catchy proving laughs when you least expect it amitabh <UNK> surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as <UNK> <UNK> his accent body language brilliant br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> re <UNK> is the best song hilarious
<START> this is how i felt while watching this film i loved it it was hilarious but i did feel a like i was getting <UNK> view into <UNK> psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point a friend put it this way br br i feel like we broke into <UNK> house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge br br another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film <UNK> gary the original <UNK> kid is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope of getting on film and he certainly does though not perhaps as he initially expected with high hopes of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has <UNK> in his home town <UNK> by his own drag act olivia <UNK> don br br director <UNK> harris does a brilliant job with this slowly <UNK> story some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone <UNK> over two subsequent <UNK> into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america harris simultaneously <UNK> the attitudes of small town america the cult of celebrity and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry br br both sean penn and <UNK> glover pull out <UNK> performances a young sean penn is the most <UNK> so closely does he follow the actual <UNK> <UNK> but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way harris wants it to go br br in the end the wide eyed <UNK> the original gary is what moved me when <UNK> against these possible interpretations of his situation br br a film not to miss i have not seen anything else like it br br <UNK>
<START> i wasn't quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic <UNK> soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but as it turns out this is a pretty good show no small thanks to talented casting four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings on of their love lives the hour long program follows each of them <UNK> through their often screwed up <UNK> to find love and it does it without being boring or trite sharon <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> one allegedly widowed after september <UNK> who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends who tend to be a little <UNK> and more creative in their <UNK> it's great to see small back on t v as she was great in the inspector <UNK> mysteries the chick can act <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> a lawyer is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women as she <UNK> with her kind but self absorbed husband <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in his driven desire to have a child with her regardless of her needs the final two members of the cast are the <UNK> jess <UNK> <UNK> an events <UNK> who's a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone gender not specific and katie sarah <UNK> a somber doctor who's affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life <UNK> out of control that being said i'm hooked now and hope that the bbc continues <UNK> this series out because it's good it's different and it's got a great cast
<START> this piece ain't really worth a comment it's simply the worst horror movie i have ever seen the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry shame on you i say
<START> kathryn <UNK> and mark <UNK> are already preparing a sequel about a young us <UNK> in afghanistan he also happens to be a highly <UNK> surgeon and is <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> operating on wounded <UNK> soldiers on a particularly difficult mission he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots <UNK> bin laden from a distance of about 3000 <UNK> he is then finally promoted to sergeant but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career so he <UNK> from the army altogether one year later frustrated with <UNK> life he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform
<START> i don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless br br what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co star gets a career boost and brad <UNK> gets a name to draw people into watching his movie br br i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some <UNK> but nothing over the top i got an <UNK> kick out of jim parsons as the <UNK> at a construction company when he looks at freeman <UNK> and says you make me want to be a woman he's just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too br br in short it's a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse
<START> <UNK> is a masterpiece of the 80's it's a movie that <UNK> through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch in <UNK> both lovers of european and american cinema can find things to relate on the screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters ed harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date he portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line in each move robert de niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the <UNK> but also most realistic performances in his career <UNK> is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical hollywood's typical character elements after the war none is a hero everybody is a loser and this movie is about that simple truth none can <UNK> up his pieces after a war just like the heroes of this movie <UNK> is about the <UNK> of the soul that war creates simply magnificent movie
<START> when i rented unhinged i was expecting a gore movie the box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release i now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater after finishing the movie i wondered how it could even receive a video release br br the plot is as follows a group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree these women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion which contains an extremely sexist woman beyond this point the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release br br one of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting lisa <UNK> who plays the main character looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards the others acting is bad but not nearly as bad as hers another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling this gets very annoying as the movie progresses on top of all that there is very little gore which makes the box very misleading br br don't waste your time on this one my rating 1 out of 10
<START> a pure reality <UNK> film fragile beautiful and amazing first film of the director represented spain on the <UNK> 2002 some people has compared the <UNK> of the film with <UNK> films well that shouldn't be a problem
<START> as with most of <UNK> <UNK> films this one plays out along the <UNK> of plots for some reason oh it is explained she's selected to transport a <UNK> mine to cuba good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing but as always <UNK> dancing is superb and worth the price of admission and in this one <UNK> plays his cowardly lion <UNK> warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939 a <UNK> benefit is hearing a young frank with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise guy persona later on in addition the great drummer buddy rich has a wonderful time displaying his <UNK> watch particularly for his unique <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> man <UNK> <UNK> i say unique perhaps in ignorance but i know of no other drum <UNK> sequence like this one on film or records this film is fun even <UNK> goofy persona is relatively restrained powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake no wait i mean the the whole damn <UNK> it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created please just do yourself a favor if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney then <UNK> that thirty times <UNK> and you would still only get a small <UNK> of the horror you would be in store for in <UNK> i guess you really can call it a horror movie but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story br br real rating 10 disgusting
<START> <UNK> is a fine adaptation of stephen <UNK> play <UNK> <UNK> the screenplay was also written by <UNK> <UNK> directed by david hugh jones that explores the too frequently forgotten effect of battle on veterans damaged <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> of war it is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our <UNK> <UNK> br br three friends went off to the vietnam war together and only two returned alive the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one david <UNK> <UNK> ed harris is so severely damaged by <UNK> stress syndrome that he <UNK> in a drunken <UNK> with his very plain <UNK> sister martha kathy baker as david <UNK> his buddy joseph <UNK> <UNK> robert de niro returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend in the course of events <UNK> at first offers <UNK> to martha and eventually the two date at a prom martha must attend and at that prom drunken david completely falls apart destroying <UNK> in the school and terrifying the <UNK> and students <UNK> makes dave <UNK> the moment in vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings david to the point where he can begin his climb toward <UNK> and the long suffering martha finds her needs tended by <UNK> too br br all three actors give astonishingly fine performances ed harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while de niro and baker maintain the high standards set by their careers more people should help <UNK> this all but forgotten film as it is a <UNK> reminder of the <UNK> our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after <UNK> end highly recommended grady <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is the way we have to reach for the beauty and <UNK> is the stuff this film is made of if not his best it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies br br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity as the song from whom the films takes its title <UNK> well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that no one is able to judge anybody all this with the <UNK> of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that bogdanovich touch based on the point of view is a class on cinema language something that p b learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of sinatra's trilogy this movie full of self consciousness and compassion and far away from self <UNK> and <UNK> as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed it's not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
<START> <UNK> castle in the sky more than any of <UNK> miyazaki's movies brings the joy of storytelling to the audience it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again it's just magical it's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states but now that it's here check it out and stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book whatever br br i give it a ten ten
<START> i don't believe they made this film completely unnecessary the first film was okay but there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film this film feels like a soap opera the writing is so bad it's utterly simple the jokes don't come across the acting is flat it's shot like a soap it lacks any direction the first film had a good emotional spine behind it every character had a little arc it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film but this time around there is no cohesive story line the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens one good thing the brazilian boy who plays <UNK> <UNK> son is pretty well cast that was their one moment of creative success on this film i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to <UNK> spirit <UNK> but please god don't let them make a third feature installment
<START> as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again the swimming pond it's called a tank in central texas the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end through the pain we go through in life life goes on and there can be forgiveness
<START> i basically found <UNK> <UNK> to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch however there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing the back to the earth philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically <UNK> as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on as was the don't ask don't tell pseudo <UNK> of the <UNK> made up of east coast <UNK> except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia where i imagine the good <UNK> boy mentality still dominated even <UNK> schools like this one another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to <UNK> or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly <UNK> images i felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their <UNK> i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene
<START> i know a few things that are worst a few it had a couple of funny scenes it is a movie not appropriate for kids but only a child would find this movie hilarious this is <UNK> a movie that you would like to use a free rental <UNK> for don't waste your money just to laugh a couple of times
<START> if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it so bad it wasn't intended to be that way but superb anyway go find it somewhere whatever you do do not miss it
<START> the picture is developed in <UNK> and talks as lin <UNK> james stewart and high spade <UNK> <UNK> arrive to dodge city looking for an enemy called dutch henry stephen <UNK> the sheriff <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> to leave their guns both participate in an shot contest and stewart earns a winchester 73 the rifle greatest of the west but is robbed and starting the possession hand to hand john mcintire charles drake dan duryea meanwhile the starring is going on the vengeance br br first western interpreted by james stewart directed by anthony mann that achieved revive the genre during 50 decade the film has an extraordinary casting including brief <UNK> of rock hudson and tony curtis both <UNK> the picture is well narrated and directed by the magnificent director anthony mann who has made <UNK> classics western bend the river far country man of <UNK> naked <UNK> tin star of course all the essential elements western are in this film thus red indians attack raid by <UNK> final showdown the breathtaking cinematography by greta <UNK> favourite photographer <UNK> daniels james stewart <UNK> a new type of <UNK> the <UNK> on the box office that will imitate <UNK> others great hollywood stars although the argument is an adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> novel of stuart l lake and screenwriter is <UNK> chase is also based about real events because 4 july <UNK> in dodge city had a shot competition and the winner was rewarded with a winchester 73 model <UNK> with ability shoot 17 <UNK> caliber <UNK> 40 in few seconds
<START> this is a great film the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now i may not have seen the play but even if i had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good
<START> the basic formula for the original series was take someone get the audience to like them then put them into mortal danger this formula worked for the <UNK> episodes made between 1964 <UNK> br br now we jump forward 40 years to 2004 we are introduced to alan tracy a somewhat less than <UNK> college school kid with his friend <UNK> a young know it all they are <UNK> off by lady penelope in her pink ford <UNK> to the island paradise where the tracy family live for the school holidays almost immediately they are left in the care of <UNK> and his daughter tin tin whilst the adults go to rescue john from <UNK> 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident this is all part of the <UNK> scheme to take over tracy island so that he can steal the <UNK> machines br br <UNK> rob a bank br br yes the plot is as limp as that br br the dialogue is banal the acting more wooden than that of the <UNK> puppets the effects anything but special and hans <UNK> <UNK> what little there was of barry <UNK> glorious theme <UNK> through <UNK> lackluster <UNK> the rest of the score was <UNK> forgettable in fact part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn't <UNK> it i didn't even bother to stay to witness <UNK> mediocre efforts with the end titles br br to be fair ron cook worked quite well as parker he and sophia <UNK> as penelope seemed wasted with the right material they could have been show <UNK> the cgi work was what i would have called leading edge 5 years ago br br the dynamics of the main craft were just wrong the original series models at least moved as if they had mass br br another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product <UNK> from every vehicle being built by ford to the entire content of the tracy <UNK> being produced by ben <UNK> br br my son 9 enjoyed the film but this cross between spy kids and <UNK> aimed <UNK> at his age group added nothing to the thunderbirds legend when star trek hit the big screen in 1979 with 'the motion <UNK> a whole new <UNK> of life was <UNK> into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so with this film <UNK> has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the thunderbirds franchise br br i predict that this film like 'the <UNK> and 'the <UNK> before it will sink into obscurity within 6 months leaving the original series to its <UNK> status
<START> this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny when i saw this film i saw it for john candy and assumed <UNK> that it would be hilarious instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments and to top it off candy delivered some of the <UNK> lines i had ever heard up to that time so despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs it's really a shame it could have been so much better i mean with eugene levy joe <UNK> and john candy it should have been wonderful
<START> as a baseball die hard this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie authentic looking sports action believable characters and an original story line while angels in the <UNK> fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two angels weaves the story of roger and j p two <UNK> foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the <UNK> angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games pushed by his <UNK> father's promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the <UNK> roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond <UNK> spirits bent on <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> spiral and when short <UNK> manager george knox portrayed by danny glover begins believing in what roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around and roger and j p find something to believe in glover in particular gives a nice performance and tony <UNK> playing a washed up <UNK> also does well despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the <UNK>
<START> by all accounts this could have been an interesting film featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth starring their <UNK> dani and being hyped up as the future of british horror i expected alex <UNK> gore fest to live up to the hype br br i was wrong br br everything about this film is either cliche or inept the short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties admittedly the idea of 'the sick <UNK> did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting br br <UNK> cannot write dialogue every sentence with the main police investigator is <UNK> full with swearing and <UNK> the typical <UNK> on the <UNK> formula funny i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before no <UNK> you are not tarantino or scorsese it sounds bad add <UNK> <UNK> acting with very dodgy casting don't get me wrong dani filth is a great singer and musician but actor he ain't and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein <UNK> cringing give me bruce campbell any day br br the visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious cgi awful gore effects for goodness <UNK> peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing <UNK> that <UNK> over use as for the often <UNK> use of cradle of <UNK> score man they should sue br br the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and <UNK> terror and <UNK> within its audience too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects <UNK> maniac zombie flesh <UNK> the beyond <UNK> etc rendering cradle of fear in my mind second rate and <UNK> br br i hope <UNK> can learn from this hideous <UNK> of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares br br better luck next time
<START> most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters they <UNK> the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen br br if i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film it didn't make you care about the characters like them or dislike them it turns the characters into jokes br br awful br br ridiculous br br waste of two hours of my life
<START> this is a thinking man's silly movie if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic <UNK> of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way br br it's not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
<START> this is an excellent movie the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent the movie is basically about a well accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home once the bodies are at his home he <UNK> stuff i hate to use such a general term but i forget what it was he removed and puts it into his wife to retain her youth then a reporter patricia hunter <UNK> the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place definitely watch this <UNK> but <UNK> if you can
<START> in <UNK> in broken bow <UNK> a farmer shoots the <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> rifle after the explosion of a <UNK> store in his farm and the <UNK> is sent to the <UNK> hospital the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the life support system and bring the corpse of <UNK> to his warrior empire in planet <UNK> with honor however captain jonathan archer <UNK> to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back <UNK> alive to his home planet jonathan invites <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dr <UNK> who is treating <UNK> to complete his crew and the <UNK> sub commander <UNK> is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise when the equipment of the starship is shut down <UNK> is kidnapped by <UNK> after a shooting in the hospital after the <UNK> of the <UNK> killed in the shooting captain archer is informed by dr <UNK> that the alien was actually a mutant altered in a sophisticated genetic <UNK> process <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the enterprise to track the <UNK> <UNK> until she reaches planet <UNK> x they investigate and <UNK> that <UNK> was a <UNK> bringing an important message about the <UNK> cold war from the <UNK> <UNK> to the leaders of the <UNK> in <UNK> br br in spite of being a huge fan of star trek i have not followed the episodes of enterprise on cable television i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me the adventure of the first enterprise captain jonathan archer the gorgeous <UNK> reed <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> and trip is excellent at least in this pilot i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually <UNK> in two parts but on dvd they are just one therefore my review is valid for both i did not like the music score theme which i found very annoying but this was an exception in this great show my vote is nine br br title brazil broken bow
<START> well this movie started out funny but quickly <UNK> i thought it would be more <UNK> <UNK> humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made for disney channel type mode especially a go <UNK> racing scene that was incredibly long <UNK> de la <UNK> is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the <UNK> scene but overall this one was a <UNK> the laughs are very few and far between the end surprise for mr fix it is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie
<START> sadly marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie <UNK> life to go along with her own issues with men as typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted to add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to bettie page herself bettie did not leave the <UNK> because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a born again later in life through the influence of her 3rd husband a minister she left it because she was in her late 30's her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks the hints of <UNK> and rape are <UNK> and denied in <UNK> own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been <UNK> by men harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick <UNK> harron also fails to make a point that bunny <UNK> who did many famous photo shoots of bettie also did many naughty shoots with bettie and was not the morally <UNK> professional photographer portrayed in the film br br the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it
<START> may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again don't get me wrong i still don't like the movie i still think it's dreck and i still think the zombies don't look all that zombie ish the story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame the story is about a guy named rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that <UNK> sick cells in animals and his brother <UNK> the two aren't exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot one day <UNK> is shot in a drive by shooting and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to <UNK> <UNK> whereas most people would've called <UNK> but whatever naturally the serum fails and <UNK> dies if that didn't happen <UNK> have been no movie after the police and the <UNK> until the end of time i will still think that maybe the <UNK> should've shown up leave the scene shows the <UNK> van which i still believe was just someone's van with a <UNK> <UNK> thrown on the side and <UNK> returning to life to attack and kill the <UNK> i would talk more about the plot but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it and we wouldn't want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least <UNK> and is rather slow moving pun not intended as i've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies i still think they look like they've been in a bar fight that's not to say that they should all be <UNK> and <UNK> but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims also i still don't like the fact that the director s continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move they couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or <UNK> as most zombie movies do don't get me wrong i'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people in one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just <UNK> to them and sometimes they just don't seem believable yes i know their <UNK> creatures but still i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and i still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then <UNK> like he was just shot the sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non existent music in a movie is important folks especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick the acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the american actors from the japanese zombie movie junk the movie is still bad almost house of the dead bad it's better no doubt about that but then again that's not saying much it's not the worst movie out there and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn't good i also think the movie moves really really slow despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes i still don't like the opening song this is the type of movie i think is well suited to be premiered on the sci fi network which is why i am <UNK> to give this <UNK> of a film a one out of ten but think of it this way at least it's not a negative one
<START> i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful <UNK> or artistically as it should have been and discovered considerable artistic merit which may ultimately have been its commercial <UNK> br br first of all this movie attempts serious science fiction social commentary more than action adventure there is action in it but that's not really what it's about if you focus on that you'll end up with as others have noted a bad aliens clone but again that's not what it's about br br the movie is really about <UNK> kurt russell transformation from human to near machine and back to human mostly back but because it's not trying to give you a typically <UNK> hollywood style answer kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions and he really does a wonderful job it can take two viewings to appreciate it br br the surrounding social logic is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether <UNK> ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his <UNK> human <UNK> or what but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for <UNK> easy to <UNK> talent
<START> devil's experiment 1 10 hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot gee that is one lucky pizza boy and those without <UNK> amateurs <UNK> devil's experiment falls <UNK> into the latter category br br it is of course the horror version of hardcore porn an almost completely plot less <UNK> minute wait for the money shot shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non <UNK> japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive japanese girl the <UNK> range from the banal <UNK> her 50 times kicking her a hundred the silly <UNK> her to an office chair and spinning her around the fear factor a bath of <UNK> and sheep guts and finally the money shot a well executed <UNK> <UNK> br br that's it no plot no motive just blair witch tree shots and torture the girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the spanish <UNK> during the office chair scene i was bored silly staring <UNK> at the screen waiting for the money shot just like hardcore porn
<START> not being a fan of first person <UNK> i was very <UNK> to play this game after having played the <UNK> however i was sold <UNK> really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in you have this green <UNK> called the <UNK> stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at with a special spell the <UNK> you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you walking in a <UNK> you suddenly hear the magical stone <UNK> look with the stone glowing at for example a painting and then using the <UNK> spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of <UNK> this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't expect them and can kill you very quickly there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead to experience something like this is a real accomplishment there are a lot of elements that take <UNK> to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called <UNK> that is all fine in the beginning but with all the <UNK> times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating and there is no map the game demands you <UNK> your surroundings so patience is required also there are some jumping <UNK> that you have to do otherwise you can't progress i don't mind jumping on <UNK> in third person adventures but in first person mode that can be an annoying task luckily you can save at anytime and <UNK> and trust me you will need it overall <UNK> is an extraordinary first person <UNK> that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
<START> spoilers spoilers continued br br from here on in the whole movie <UNK> in on itself first we meet a rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like we get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage two <UNK> that serve no real purpose and have no character what so ever and a bunch of henchmen someone's told me they're vampires straight out of blade 2 but they're so <UNK> i didn't realise br br the funny <UNK> guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the <UNK> only for far longer and far far worse he has a simple point about cause and effect makes it then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid his final line before walking off is comparable to <UNK> do you know what happens to a <UNK> line in x men in levels of utter bland <UNK> the chocolate cake is such a lazy pathetic cliche and monica <UNK> as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her br br and then we get another kung fu fight why neo is allegedly the one he can do anything he has the ultimate power and what does he use it for kung bloody fu all the time and while he can stop 1000 bullets he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 <UNK> henchmen vampires i wanted to see mind blowing powers i wanted to see him do the <UNK> <UNK> most insane s to people because he can do anything i got the same as before without the <UNK> br br the <UNK> car chase that can't be bad well no it's not it's just not what we've been <UNK> it was going to be all the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer every one so all possibly wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with guess what a kung fu fight ok it's not neo but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the matrix at least taught them something it's not hard br br hey <UNK> don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix it's not real as long as you understand that <UNK> real then nothing can really harm you br br there you go simple br br ok so the chase is not bad it's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes it's just so <UNK> and still it gets worse br br the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable they have this whole elaborate plan that involves three <UNK> they then only show it <UNK> between <UNK> over long super preachy monologue to make it worse they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is you know basically but you don't know who's doing what when so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on br br i'll sum it up though it happens so <UNK> can get back into the matrix to setup the end that's the only reason it happens which raises the question why did they need to send 6 people originally <UNK> gets in in five minutes by herself br br <UNK> journey to the centre of the matrix so to speak is handled equally <UNK> <UNK> he runs into another 100 agent <UNK> <UNK> that must've taken a lot of thought only now they're in a <UNK> so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment man what a grand finale br br and then the architect br br remember everything i said was bad about the <UNK> and the foreign guy add them together and double it that's how truly appalling the architect is the only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the <UNK> climax br br and then he blows it br br let's look at the <UNK> he gives neo choose one door and all humanity dies except 27 choose the other and all humanity dies considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's hero one if he had a choice of save humanity and the <UNK> dies or save the <UNK> and kill humanity there's the <UNK> for inner torment and tension also with <UNK> being mid fall the potential of a real cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential but no he has save no one or save the <UNK> br br now the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end the year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid jar jar was they didn't notice that the very end of the matrix made him look him steven <UNK> the <UNK> told me i'd fall in love with the one and i love you come on how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was br br so what do the <UNK> do in the sequel well they make the ending of the original look better how well by doing almost exactly the same thing again only <UNK> characters only so much worse i think my f a and r keys would be worn out if i kept writing far before i got to worse br br and the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger it's a reminder br br basically this film is just bad i really didn't want it to be bad but it is bad in just so many ways and to make matters worse this isn't a film with not enough budget it's not a film with too short a schedule it's not a film that's been rushed out it's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside this is exactly the film the <UNK> set out to make with <UNK> fortune fully behind them and that's what makes this so awful at least <UNK> <UNK> can say that it didn't <UNK> enough time or money br br matrix <UNK> the worst film ever made maybe not quite the most disappointing and <UNK> film ever made br br undeniably br br
<START> quite possibly how francis <UNK> one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to <UNK> it's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it's genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and film making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers for once the near eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink and you'll miss it theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking
<START> this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these a holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost
<START> did you know that anthony <UNK> singer from the red hot <UNK> <UNK> father is in this movie <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> father i noticed this after reading <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> autobiography and saw a picture of his father i thought well that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles after checking this site and comparing with a search on the net i realized it really is his father in the movie it's funny because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie perhaps his son was ashamed of his father's acting job in this flick but he need not be i think his father <UNK> did a great job in the show
<START> i think it's time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a <UNK> but a cold blooded killer ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was this is not the worst of the films concerning vietnam that honor goes to john <UNK> green <UNK> in any case john rambo carrying around a 50 cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the <UNK> <UNK> army plus a good many russians is an insult to watch what is worse is <UNK> cheesy speech at the end please oh yeah i heard they are making another one
<START> this post contains spoiler s br br i'm not a big fan of chuck norris as an actor but i worship him in all other ways he also have his own fan web site with chuck norris facts that is really entertaining but this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those facts into one movie i really don't remember when i wasted my time more than with this action i don't know what's the worst this movie can offer you unoriginal and thousand times made plot of terrorists who are trying to <UNK> us by <UNK> <UNK> on us <UNK> or perhaps that great dialogs and <UNK> words of wisdom about life and everything else someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak english in everyday life it's a never ending list of crap not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film that is kinda annoying the chief terrorist send his <UNK> message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is chuck norris of course no one else in america is not smart enough to see that and the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous one man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp <UNK> i'm lying he had a knife escapes his <UNK> with jet pack and then <UNK> <UNK> for few hundred maybe even thousand <UNK> to nearest shore <UNK> border is <UNK> <UNK> far away from nearest shore where he is rescued by submarine i hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good but that's even more funny than the plot if you didn't know 85 of terrorist are masters of some martial art but chuck and co beat the sh t out of them not only they kill them easily they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few <UNK> like dolls you may ask me did i watch this movie to the end i did why because i just wanted to see who of these two super heroes will <UNK> the nuclear bomb of few hundred <UNK> and size of a <UNK> and then i realized what fool i am of course it's <UNK> movie after all and not only he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> but he do it twice i could write a book about all the stupid things in this movie but i would spend my life <UNK> br br so makers of this movie made another chuck norris fact to be added on his web site can chuck norris <UNK> nuclear bomb yes and he can do it twice
<START> i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film he failed thank god br br the film is a very simple romantic comedy with <UNK> <UNK> playing an ugly woman who uses her <UNK> uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won't like her because she's ugly the film is just bad for so many reasons the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious <UNK> bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit those two scenes made me cringe <UNK> character is <UNK> arrogant and guessing from her role as stand up <UNK> and arch feminist is in real life too she claims that the film is anti feminist when in fact it's just realistic men more often than not go for looks over personality it's interesting to note her <UNK> too she'd been a feminist and <UNK> for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film i mean come on she acted in it for <UNK> sake what this film was really was anti men if anything it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their <UNK> with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma <UNK> character <UNK> br br there are other bad things about this film too like ben <UNK> character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and <UNK> his accent a few times for good measure is that the best the script writers could come up with <UNK> they've never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made there's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is the other comments on here all say how <UNK> <UNK> isn't ugly but is actually beautiful <UNK> was i watching the same film as they were she's certainly no <UNK> and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one although having said that i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well she's <UNK> and <UNK> looking br br i guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it br br you will know what the ending will be br br you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and br br you will be bored after ten minutes br br watch at your own peril
<START> admittedly <UNK> is not an opera that can appeal to everyone although it is a favourite of mine <UNK> 1951 in particular <UNK> entire approach is so static whenever the music suddenly begins to <UNK> <UNK> keeps the cast moving at the same pace the takes on <UNK> and <UNK> are endless whatever happened to film editing the result is physically <UNK> to watch the viewer is never <UNK> transported your <UNK> is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that wagner got it right <UNK> got it wrong and that set decoration with those clever <UNK> of <UNK> anti <UNK> will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of wagner
<START> i read some comments on the internet about this film like harder then hostel the camera never screens of when it's getting really brutal but none of them is true the camera never screens of because there is nothing to screen of the same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again women lies on a table killer rapes women a few times killer cuts women into pieces you never see this during the whole film police come and arrested him killer fools the jury film over in germany we would say <UNK> <UNK> um <UNK> all in all one of the most boring films i ever see absolutely non <UNK>
<START> this is an almost action less film following jack an <UNK> as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time can't tell reality from <UNK> br br dominic <UNK> as jack is truly believable confused and scared but <UNK> and at times <UNK> accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep br br introduce a talking dog another <UNK> and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there more <UNK> and you have an interesting mind <UNK> <UNK> minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
<START> saw this flick on <UNK> last <UNK> for the third or fourth time enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd this really is a standout and of course the first of the mann stewart <UNK> more here than the usual <UNK> although not quite as powerful as the <UNK> lots of obvious symbolism about achieving <UNK> but mainly it's the acting by stewart his partner <UNK> mitchell <UNK> winters and the <UNK> johnny dean dan duryea steve miller not the joker is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in lola but too yellow like stewart in the man who killed liberty <UNK> he's practically reduced to putting on an <UNK> and serving his enemies coffee <UNK> no doubt tony curtis from the <UNK> <UNK> and rock hudson behaving like no indian i've seen on screen have interesting cameos br br special performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealing gun <UNK> who hangs out at a very low grade western version of <UNK> american <UNK> nobody wants to spend the night there jay c <UNK> out over a kiss from lola winters and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country will <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and the indian chief who takes walter <UNK> teeth from him in red river are pleasant <UNK> this is the kind of western that only stewart not wayne nor scott could have pulled off worth the shot i repeat
<START> in the trivia section for pet sematary it mentions that george romero director of two stephen king stories <UNK> and the dark half was set to direct and then pulled out one wonders what he would've brought to the film as the director mary <UNK> while not really a bad director doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel of which he wrote the screenplay there are of course some very effective <UNK> surreal scenes mainly involving the sister <UNK> likely more of a creep out for kids if they see the film and the casting in some of the roles is dead perfect but something feels missing at times some sort of style that could <UNK> with the <UNK> king like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in who knows if he'll save that for his final novel br br as mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably <UNK> hughes as gage <UNK> the little boy who goes from being one of the <UNK> little kids this side of an 80's horror movie to being a little monster i say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes <UNK> a certain <UNK> and there is also a <UNK> supporting role for fred <UNK> of the <UNK> who plays this old <UNK> man with the right notes of under playing and doom in tone and applause goes to <UNK> did the make up on andrew <UNK> but there are some other flaws though in the other casting <UNK> <UNK> is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure <UNK> and his daughter <UNK> is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all br br in terms of setting up some chilling set pieces only a couple really stand out a certain plot <UNK> moment not to spoil it does involve a cool ramones song and the first visit to the pet sematary the bigger one including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining for the most part it's a very polished directing job though it could've been made even darker to <UNK> with the script if thought out in logical terms albeit in king terms it is really one of his more effective works of the period but it doesn't add up like it could or should still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie
<START> actually goldie hawn is from washington <UNK> park <UNK> but i <UNK> this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big <UNK> life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the end beautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
<START> a friend of mine bought this film for <UNK> and even then it was grossly <UNK> despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob <UNK> and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a <UNK> and <UNK> it straight through your <UNK> it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of <UNK> girls' br br adam sandler plays a <UNK> on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the <UNK> resident comedian the shamelessly named <UNK> due to his <UNK> success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea <UNK> character <UNK> gets his big break <UNK> is not dead he's rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick br br perhaps from his mouth he just <UNK> the worst film of all time
<START> br br this is without a doubt the funniest comedy of the year everybody is brilliant the acting is superb you can see that the actors enjoyed making this film it´s a shame to spoil the film with give <UNK> so rent it and laugh your ass off br br 9 10
<START> why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie the first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy perhaps of all time todd sheets is still the director but no longer the screenwriter which isn't a negative or a positive considering he's just as <UNK> as the guy who wrote this one the writing is too heavily <UNK> on the f word which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at <UNK> the acting is about on par with the last two bloodbath movies so naturally it's some of the worst i've ever seen the special effects are better than the last 2 but they still look <UNK> the plot has become too complicated for it's own good and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced also featured is <UNK> frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel leading to one of the most idiotic endings i've ever seen after the movie it goes to <UNK> which is strange because this whole movie is an <UNK> only see this to make fun of it because if you go into this with a serious mind you might possibly kill yourself br br my rating bomb 95 mins
<START> that's not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now don't get me wrong here either i'm not a total <UNK> i didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like <UNK> academy <UNK> or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swear br br <UNK> is poor and i am honestly <UNK> as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long <UNK> self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could <UNK> be what people so love about the movie there's some high <UNK> actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self <UNK> tom cruise <UNK> tells me it's his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely <UNK> meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a <UNK> pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something br br it doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or <UNK> with well i didn't think so but i don't like most people admittedly they all play out their rather <UNK> life stories at great length <UNK> their character flaws and emotions in ever so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the <UNK> degree with many a <UNK> <UNK> en route <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> dire as well with that <UNK> <UNK> irritating quality that i had <UNK> thought unique to the music of <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of <UNK> whilst being <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> by a disgruntled <UNK> goat the bit with the <UNK> is good though
<START> i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful <UNK> showed such <UNK> character traits and <UNK> spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but i liked him much better in this br br although the characters are interesting and well developed i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didn't really still a fun time had by all even for <UNK>
<START> released just before the production code <UNK> in july 1934 mitch <UNK> all star paramount musical is <UNK> suggestive some even claim misogynistic and highly entertaining two murders occur on the opening night of earl <UNK> <UNK> one on stage but that doesn't stop the manager jack <UNK> from putting on a show as a <UNK> police detective victor mclaglen <UNK> everyone is hiding something and gypsy rose lee must have seen this <UNK> murder mystery before she penned the g string murders as the denouement is similar although more satisfying here <UNK> michael as a vicious <UNK> stops the show in more ways than one with her exotic sweet marijuana number and duke <UNK> finishes with the <UNK> rape of the <UNK> the hit song <UNK> for two came from this film a bizarre and <UNK> camp classic highly recommended here's <UNK> o parsons in the los angeles <UNK> on may 17 1934 br br earl <UNK> hand picked <UNK> <UNK> about on the <UNK> united artists screen in a <UNK> <UNK> and not much else but september <UNK> herself never had a better figure than these <UNK> who are made up to please the eye especially the eye of the tired businessman but don't for a moment think mr <UNK> girls <UNK> <UNK> are the only attraction believe it or not murder at the <UNK> is a musical comedy thriller if you know what i mean a murder mystery <UNK> in a musical show it all happens on the opening night at the time the play is in progress and a search is on for a murderer just by way of suspense a cop threatens to stop the show every few minutes victor mclaglen is something new in cops all the time he is trying to track down the murderer he keeps his eye <UNK> on the chorus <UNK> the murder mystery is good with the exception of the denouement which is pretty flat probably <UNK> direction dorothy <UNK> who plays the maid is about as melodramatic as the heroine in a ten twenty and thirty show for no good reason she rates a never ending <UNK> in the big dramatic scene the girl <UNK> are good and it's a positive relief to get away from the inevitable <UNK> shots the costumes are beautiful in fact this is a musical that paramount can feel is really to their credit as for carl <UNK> well he would be an addition to any show good looking with a delightful singing voice and an easy assured manner he is all his press agents claim for him i also like kitty <UNK> who plays the leading lady in the show <UNK> michael as the deep eyed <UNK> gives an interesting if rather fictional portrayal jack <UNK> as the stage manager is the same old <UNK> jack but we wouldn't change him jessie ralph is excellent as the <UNK> others in the cast are charles <UNK> <UNK> patrick donald meek barbara <UNK> toby wing and <UNK> andre the screen play is by carey wilson and <UNK> king and the direction by mitchell <UNK> the music is by arthur <UNK> and the lyrics by sam <UNK> in addition to murder at the <UNK> there is a mickey mouse cartoon a paramount <UNK> and a two <UNK> the wrong direction br br i disagree with <UNK> on the denouement it's satisfying if over the top why would she blame the director was she <UNK> with the story's ending or the way it was staged and what's a ten twenty or thirty show note the <UNK> taken at busby berkeley and his <UNK> shots as hard as it may be to believe today the public was <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> by may 1934 mitch <UNK> said if you are showing a stage show that's supposed to be in a theater you should stay within the <UNK> of the <UNK> arch and not do a buzz berkeley routine with a stage set that's <UNK> big br br q don't you think <UNK> spectacular effects justified taking this liberty <UNK> apparently they did because they're <UNK> all of his pictures and none of mine but personally i don't like it
<START> honestly this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent not only that you've got to be brave athletic cunning etc it actually requires skill not like some lame ass shows that are on these days and yet they only have two seasons of it bull they need to bring this show back br br although they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from <UNK> he was great br br but seriously it was an amazing show you never knew who would be going when and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to br br bring back the mole bring back the mole
<START> i've seen many of guy <UNK> films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john <UNK> editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour de force sequence showing a line of heads <UNK> to look at one object does nothing but <UNK> with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience br br another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than <UNK> earlier works though his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an <UNK> feeling of humanity this one seemed more like <UNK> for <UNK> sake br br as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy <UNK> does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well
<START> i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather <UNK> chess <UNK> in <UNK> game as white against an <UNK> <UNK> immediately before the final despite the use of jonathan <UNK> as <UNK> chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after <UNK> combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his <UNK> on <UNK> is still <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> against his king in the corner at <UNK> thus he is unable to play the <UNK> <UNK> move <UNK> <UNK> which would be illegal but he's shown doing so to <UNK> applause from the audience
<START> this hamlet made for one of the <UNK> <UNK> episodes ever i am not a <UNK> fan but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many <UNK> listed like i said though this one is quite boring it is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help this is the one <UNK> 3000 i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep
<START> i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of view br br <UNK> or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows <UNK> a lonely <UNK> <UNK> as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so that's the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act as a detective who <UNK> the incident tells him we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die br br comparisons to <UNK> antonioni and his <UNK> will most likely abound in any review you read about <UNK> the influence of <UNK> philosophical and <UNK> style and the story of <UNK> are clear and in fact writer director fred <UNK> makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which <UNK> attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks did br br the only other person to share his or her views on the film <UNK> the college film class look and sound of the film he or she <UNK> to consider the <UNK> constraints that an <UNK> <UNK> film most likely faces but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and <UNK> sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the <UNK> of <UNK> the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film whether or not that was <UNK> intention the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money but this <UNK> is used to the film's advantage br br <UNK> succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self serious it could have easily fell into the <UNK> of a mystery story but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt if you are more concerned with plot this film and its ending may <UNK> you otherwise take the time to be engaged by it it is well worth seeking out
<START> bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story i felt the ending of this movie was not handled <UNK> as they did in the original english movie this movie is very <UNK> if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for <UNK> you may not like the ending but on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions <UNK> was good as a caring wife and mother everybody acted well
<START> the good br br effective color scheme good costumes top notch set production well detailed cgi buildings and vehicles br br the bad br br horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago flawed logic a giant <UNK> shows up and no one <UNK> it no one really even questions it and there is no explanation as to why the god <UNK> was even cast out nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as <UNK> jill br br the ugly br br awful script so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized the dialog was almost laughable at some points random characters and events that are not needed dull characters jill is supposed to be this mystery but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer there is nothing to her she is uninteresting and boring to watch she has no substance no <UNK> her character has no redeeming qualities in fact there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose any goals besides the obvious one of <UNK> any motivation they are weak and ill conceived there are no stakes the key to screen writing <UNK> will not become immortal but big deal he is a bad guy one cannot even <UNK> whether <UNK> or jill is the main character that is the problem <UNK> half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character never brings one to <UNK> they are cardboard cut outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces first time director pacing slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring everything is flat even the action is not interesting because it is short lived and sometimes unnecessary br br overall br br not worth a watch <UNK> story sub par character development corny cgi does not save the nice set production
<START> this might be unbelievable but this movie has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in russia it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running well i have no idea why <UNK> put their eye on this particular uh movie which had almost no screening around the world that's some kind of <UNK> haha maybe it was based on the fact that another movie <UNK> this with paris hilton which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere had major <UNK> in russia and <UNK> more than <UNK> besides both movies had a lot of promotion like there were the <UNK> all over the city tv commercials and etc speaking about movie i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring it could be better really even if it has jessica simpson
<START> little man now on dvd is a wayans brothers flop it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans who hides a diamond in a <UNK> purse after a heist he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the <UNK> home he then goes through all sorts of home alone or child's play like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film the jokes have been done in other places so many times that they aren't cute or funny i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who <UNK> face was <UNK> over in watching the deleted scenes minus cgi this actor was funny in a mini me like way but they chose a different route a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes spend your rental <UNK> on <UNK> if you want some real laughs these days br br http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> the trick to creating a good solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot <UNK> colorful characters or surprising twists anyone who has ever <UNK> in frustration with an un <UNK> sunday new york times <UNK> knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve <UNK> to be any fun the best murder mysteries be they on film or in print are slight affairs that get to the point spell out their clues line up their suspects and hopefully <UNK> us with a few surprises being complicated without being <UNK> confusing and they play fair on second third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place indeed good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we <UNK> the double and triple crosses br br sidney <UNK> comedy thriller deathtrap as derived from ira <UNK> hit broadway play is a great example it moves along at a <UNK> clip <UNK> <UNK> its clues being almost totally honest with us even when it is lying to us and yet never revealing where it is going even when it is telling us where it might go it is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional <UNK> than it is a movie about murder mysteries derived from a play about <UNK> rather than going <UNK> a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened deathtrap leads us through the crime s step by step leaving ample room for the unexpected as the ads advise it is less a <UNK> than a <UNK> br br deathtrap is often compared <UNK> oddly enough to the play and movie versions of sleuth though in reality it has much more in common with scream the self mocking <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> horror flicks like that clever film deathtrap <UNK> itself a thriller about thrillers sets it <UNK> a one set five character <UNK> and then proceeds to <UNK> its genre by revealing itself as the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to <UNK> an audience to suspend its disbelief br br deathtrap <UNK> gives us a mystery with only five major characters two of which are of minimum importance henry jones as a <UNK> lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition and to supply us with his <UNK> for <UNK> charm and irene worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychic <UNK> sleuth who acts as the <UNK> detective that leaves three main characters to be the killer s and or the victim s it is a testament to michael <UNK> abilities that as sidney <UNK> a down on his luck author of mystery plays he creates a character who we <UNK> like and trust even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie as his <UNK> if somewhat <UNK> wife myra <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with being over the top by giving a roller coaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be <UNK> or overbearing <UNK> or hysterical <UNK> or bold and <UNK> in love with a less than <UNK> sidney the third angle of this unexpected triangle is a <UNK> playwright named <UNK> anderson played by christopher reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is enthusiastic <UNK> wannabe writer semi innocent victim or <UNK> charming <UNK> as the various character dance around each other the cleverly <UNK> script adapted by ace <UNK> jay <UNK> allen manages to be consistently amusing even as it builds suspense and even after the final twist an improvement over the <UNK> finale it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what br br lumet is by no means a master of comedy so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp theatrical yet subtle work with reeve being particularly noteworthy but what lumet does so well is to work <UNK> in tight quarters as he did brilliantly in 12 angry men he takes a one set play and with a minimum of opening up manages to make what could have been <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> seem endlessly <UNK> and <UNK> the setting a country home converted from an old <UNK> is relatively small but as designed by tony <UNK> it manages to be both <UNK> and charming as well as spooky and <UNK> it is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character and as the scene of the crime it is a most <UNK> deathtrap indeed
<START> paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a dirty old man type of way hollow man the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it's mind blowing special effects perhaps the best so far around and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provoking and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven br br two major flaws josh <UNK> aka walking ape man and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder why were they trapped down in the lab br br a fun horror film for a saturday night
<START> i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie <UNK> and fist fights with <UNK> sound effects some of the worst actors <UNK> seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh <UNK> my stomach hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe <UNK> flicks <UNK> waiting for so if <UNK> tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window
<START> a propaganda film for the palestinian cause if you were expecting an <UNK> documentary on the israeli palestinian conflict you will need to look elsewhere if you are an anti <UNK> or merely an anti <UNK> nothing wrong with <UNK> the destruction of a country right or <UNK> in support of palestinian goals e g mass murder the destruction of israel this is the documentary for you should make for an entertaining evening on college <UNK> around the uk and us however any informed and intellectually honest person would be <UNK> at the sheer number of lies presented in this video i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't <UNK> by this anti <UNK> filth
<START> two days after seeing this thing i'm still in agony over having seen it it's so bad you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe much less allow it to be loose on the general public stilted acting a leading man who looks like he's <UNK> and alison eastwood embarrassing herself the action is <UNK> of low budget movie making which means it is painfully bad the plot well if you were 6 years old then you could have written this movie simplistic idealistic and just plain lame
<START> myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of <UNK> and agree this is by far one of the bbc better series the whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my <UNK> wont be the same without it no doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watching excellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the casting first rate in all <UNK> and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material so grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video
<START> for a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull br br nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don't generate any real excitement or interest br br the acting is good from the two leads <UNK> in particular delivers a great performance combining the <UNK> and stupidity of <UNK> but the rest of the cast also do what they need to br br the problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn't interesting <UNK> is not a unique character he isn't interesting or exciting br br films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this <UNK> nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it
<START> the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy duty cast list shouldn't have <UNK> if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the <UNK> satirical intent instead we get <UNK> bad song and dance sequences featuring <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music hall stage appropriately enough for a production that's more lionel <UNK> blair than <UNK> the acting talent is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are good but don't have to try very hard <UNK> at least has a great voice and some feel for the material julia looks perfect as mack but struggles with the character <UNK> by a fake <UNK> accent <UNK> <UNK> is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious the adaptations of lyrics script and music are often awkward it was a bad move to base the film on marc <UNK> <UNK> broadway version but at least his words were <UNK> unlike most of what's been <UNK> in gestures of <UNK> and the attempt at <UNK> the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on <UNK> <UNK> sets lit in <UNK> blues and <UNK> as if by some bargain basement <UNK> <UNK> fails utterly the film just looks cheap shoddy and <UNK> made <UNK>
<START> this film is a pure failure i am a steve martin fan but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script think police academy 7 and apply it to a military parody <UNK> br br i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received and rightfully deserved it is extremely misleading i have often seen this film marked down to 3 00 in the <UNK> store and now i certainly know why br br if only i could get my 90 minutes back
<START> daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor he is brilliant as christy brown a man who has cerebral <UNK> who then learned to write and paint with his left foot a well deserved oscar for him and brenda <UNK> who plays his loving mother hugh <UNK> is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray <UNK> is great as the father worth watching for the outstanding performances
<START> there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this film the original said it all and still holds up either read the book or do some research about the story and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous eric roberts as perry smith his sister could have done a better job having been to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where the story takes place the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas the original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims <UNK> unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake soundtrack by <UNK> jones and cinematography by conrad hall the original is available on dvd in widescreen now let this turkey die a quick death
<START> i'm afraid that i didn't like this movie very much apart from a few saving <UNK> it's nothing to write home about br br j horror has <UNK> for the last five six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and <UNK> copies of a previous success this is one of them br br basically this is a supernatural slasher movie the beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a <UNK> where a dead girl has her eyes <UNK> <UNK> together but soon after opens them however after that it's quickly downhill for this flick br br to be kind i will start with the things i like about <UNK> on the plus side the visuals are <UNK> and the movie looks great for it's type for those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed no pun intended murder scenes we also get a few good suspense sequences set pieces br br however there are quite a few <UNK> also br br first of all and my major complaint about this movie is that the plot <UNK> and jumps <UNK> and backwards in time with an <UNK> intensity usually that's not a problem for me but here where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are i was confused on more than one occasion br br the performances are okay i guess a little hard to tell when you don't know the language but seem a little stiff and for a horror movie i don't think it was scary enough for a while i was quite bored actually br br being a fan of giallo movies i was expecting quite a lot from nightmare but unfortunately i was quite disappointed
<START> lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the writer <UNK> was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and <UNK> i understand that the plot was supposed to be non climactic and stale that was what the writer director was going for a very very very dry humor comedy with all that understanding i still think the movie sucked it seemed like the writer director was trying to recreate <UNK> dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character <UNK> similar to <UNK> but <UNK> dynamite was actually funny its script worked this movie is not it has no purpose well let me <UNK> that its only purpose is to rip off <UNK> dynamite and try to capture that look and feel too bad it didn't work
<START> as an anti football person i on the surface <UNK> took my younger brother to see this film although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii the trailers looked fun so i thought i'd give it a go br br it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen and that wasn't anything to do with the neck <UNK> caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed <UNK> the acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny the entire <UNK> was laughing out loud every minute or so football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry add a dash of <UNK> culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy i've seen in a long time dare i say it better than east is east br br this film <UNK> along nicely at a lovely pace never <UNK> on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged though not a <UNK> <UNK> and turning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect br br saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited <UNK> more than used as script <UNK> i suppose depending on your particular <UNK> for happy endings you could be either delighted let down by the ending personally if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly <UNK> letter to the script writers br br as for the actors i would have to say that juliet stevenson paula put in the finest performance i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to <UNK> knightley jules but don't get me wrong even she offered a great performance it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry <UNK> this time you're it br br tip don't leave before the credits once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldn't have watched this film after all my beloved but forgotten ice <UNK> had <UNK> into a <UNK> blue juice oh what am i saying it was absolutely <UNK> and i can't recommend it enough i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos i'm a student i only <UNK> out if it's really worth it
<START> first let me just comment on what i liked about the movie the special effects were fantastic and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game there that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing br br i have <UNK> complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where <UNK> 5 year old son turns out to be the super powered child of superman when the crying super child throws a piano at <UNK> henchman to save his mother i almost got up and left the theater singer could have made a much better superman movie without <UNK> to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but <UNK> super powered <UNK> child it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit br br my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of <UNK> up into outer space it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of <UNK> he barely has the strength to stay on his feet whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman related projects ever again the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of <UNK> into the sun why not just have superman eat <UNK> he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in <UNK> <UNK> that's not any more absurd then having him <UNK> a continent of <UNK> into space and then fall <UNK> through the atmosphere without burning up in re entry or <UNK> all over central park when he hits the ground br br my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer <UNK> movie goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god like <UNK> el sent to earth to be a <UNK> <UNK> el wasn't all wise he was just a scientist and he didn't send his son to earth to be a <UNK> he threw him in a rocket and <UNK> fired it into space because his planet was about to explode i'll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode and then <UNK> pieces of heaven become <UNK> primary weakness furthermore the <UNK> scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a <UNK> <UNK> just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i'm too brain dead to notice the <UNK> obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be <UNK> the man of steel for the <UNK> future they might as well <UNK> this movie superman returns the passion of the christ br br and speaking of luthor my last major complaint has to do with <UNK> depiction of lex luthor lex luthor is a <UNK> cold hearted business <UNK> who is more apt to run for president which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world the man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman returns as well as all the previous superman movies is a wacky theatrical <UNK> who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe <UNK> next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br to <UNK> i don't know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already don't see it don't buy it when it comes out on dvd don't rent it basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way this movie does not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that sees this movie bryan singer should be <UNK> 45 billion dollars if you're a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time
<START> this movie was terrible i rented it not knowing what to expect i watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb the acting was bad and there was no plot the monster is <UNK> fake it <UNK> and its mouth <UNK> move also why would they have a doctor playing a <UNK> to kill the monster just plain bad don't even waste your time 1 out of 10
<START> in celebration of earth day disney has released the film earth stopping far short of any <UNK> message of <UNK> and doom we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their <UNK> without feeling too bad about ourselves br br the stars of the show are a herd of elephants a family of polar bears and a whale and its <UNK> the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the <UNK> all the while being introduced to <UNK> of the various climatic <UNK> <UNK> br br global warming is mentioned in while we view the <UNK> of polar bear note is made of the <UNK> sea ice islands in more recent years we never see the bears catch any <UNK> but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution br br the <UNK> shots of <UNK> <UNK> across the <UNK> is one of the most spectacular <UNK> shots i ever saw it and another of <UNK> <UNK> are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen br br one of the <UNK> i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking <UNK> were filmed in slow motion never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals their incredible speed the idea of <UNK> down the film to convey great <UNK> i think began with or at least it's the first i recall seeing the television show kung fu during the early seventies br br an interesting <UNK> is that as the credits roll during the end some <UNK> of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed there are enough dramatic humorous and <UNK> moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs perhaps because of some <UNK> editing <UNK> us as it were from the grisly end of a prey predator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right and you can take your kids br br three stars
<START> watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work i had a really hard time accepting this not that i don't think tom can't act he can i've been following his career since <UNK> and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me maybe because i'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a <UNK> the only form of life lower than a <UNK> is a <UNK> the movie as a whole fails for me the <UNK> jude law and the <UNK> everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde <UNK> took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score but tom as the angel of death sullivan was completely flat
<START> the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy seen in that light it does deliver br br if you're looking for a serious movie look somewhere else this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a <UNK> and one dimensional examination of issues with no insight whatsoever br br making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor <UNK> especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed <UNK> in predictable stereotypical ways br br <UNK> <UNK> and ice cube make the film almost watchable and michael <UNK> turns in a good performance but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite it's hard to find anything redeeming
<START> this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like most movies show jesus as being <UNK> <UNK> or tortured this jesus laughed played and was serious when it was necessary this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to not the usually hollywood version br br the movie took some liberties attempting to fill in the <UNK> but the <UNK> didn't seem impossible or even improbable one thing i might argue was that it never really explained what the <UNK> had against jesus movie portrayed that the <UNK> were the main driver of <UNK> death not that the jewish authorities were against the idea br br it seemed that the movie was <UNK> well one example was the <UNK> comment to a teenage boy who was called mark it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of <UNK> whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 <UNK> i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible
<START> this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker br br if i could give this movie a zero i would too bad imdb doesn't allow that br br the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed take my word don't waste your 8 on this piece of trash the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name in all highly not recommended
<START> kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and <UNK> actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth watching br br i say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie br br first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weak <UNK> <UNK> who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later that said kevin <UNK> character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass
<START> it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the <UNK> obsession with 'the <UNK> but if not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is yet another great czech film it is funny dark and extremely enjoyable the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing br br for a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to the films of <UNK> <UNK> and numerous others czech humour by its very nature is dark and often <UNK> but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it this film is just that it is <UNK> and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise good intent and optimism br br i highly recommend this and most other projects <UNK> and <UNK> are involved in enjoy it it's a film made for just that reason anyway it's as close as the <UNK> will ever come to writing a truly happy ending
<START> as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie i was immediately excited the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn't wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies however when i saw it i left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other movie goers at the theater with me while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them in the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more and much unfortunate preachy point of view to sum up the plot there wasn't much to it that wasn't expected the machines were digging toward <UNK> with intent of destroying it that's not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous unless you're a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply won't care it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and <UNK> agent smith for as bad ass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy personally i don't need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it the movie was a serious waste of my time and i don't think i can watch the first one anymore the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me <UNK> the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off what movie ends with to be <UNK> how original is that folks i wonder if the <UNK> brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one in conclusion the movie was bad and that's the end of it
<START> ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money the producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg 13 how many pg 13 slashers movies have turned out to be good thats like asking how many women have been on the moon the answer is none prom night 1980 was of <UNK> no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be <UNK> as a movie that stays true to its genre and <UNK> try to be anything more than that br br my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him br br 1 the way he escapes he was locked up in a mental <UNK> and he escapes through a air <UNK> <UNK> what the hell why would they have an air <UNK> <UNK> in the patients room do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something 2 his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self he says he loves her but the next minute he <UNK> to kill her so does he want to kill her love her or just plain rape her 3 the killer is too good how did he develop all of his skills he used to be a teacher so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't notice it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible silly stupid attempt at a horror movie
<START> this was one of those 50 <UNK> deals of <UNK> and far more complex than most realize and it was in color not only are the effects extraordinary vs crap like <UNK> vs the flying <UNK> the real <UNK> is the <UNK> of <UNK> everything <UNK> on two principles the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous thinking father's desire for his daughter and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all <UNK> desires become <UNK> br br needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead not many if any left and that became the fate of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rather modern actually unfortunately the <UNK> of 'the <UNK> wasted by ignorance remains and <UNK> the incestuous father knows how to access such tech and does so to prevent losing his daughter to another ancient plot beautifully rendered br br and considering its age it remains a stunning suspense action human emotion classic and visually very modern don't pass this one up it <UNK> all modern sci fi and its <UNK> content <UNK> it beyond any genre a timeless work br br and the <UNK> you will see hear no pure <UNK> and perfectly <UNK> <UNK> background a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i really enjoyed this movie britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to <UNK> and criticize you holly <UNK> her dreams just like britney br br there are times in <UNK> lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens br br i would like to thank britney for <UNK> me and my friends to follow our dreams she will never know how much that means to me bravo britney you are the greatest
<START> there are often badly matched couples in the general sense of the term in <UNK> movies african queen heaven knows mister allison roots of heaven <UNK> the barbarian and the geisha check the title is another good example so to speak it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as <UNK> the world of <UNK> wong and the <UNK> of the august moon bear witness <UNK> effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot with the exception of <UNK> maybe john wayne perfectly fits in ford's world in <UNK> he's like a bull in a china shop his japanese partner is totally bland even the dramatic scenes <UNK> <UNK> do not save the movie from absolute boredom br br only those utterly <UNK> of <UNK> every work need to choose this among all his other great movies around
<START> this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx and i bet it will be my last i failed to see why he was funny although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera or for saying i am going to take a shower br br the plot is completely predictable the bad guy comes after the good guy the good guy has a woman so the bad guy uses her in between the officials <UNK> up the final scenes are utterly unbelievable you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial <UNK> br br there's no great acting there isn't much of a plot or storyline and the shooting is done mtv style don't waste your money on this one br br
<START> gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india <UNK> my <UNK> is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into <UNK> personal life br br overall i liked the movie for story and cinematography <UNK> akshay <UNK> and <UNK> shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice <UNK> <UNK> commendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings br br however what i didn't quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone over <UNK> br br overall good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as must watch once 8 10
<START> <UNK> is a rather lesser known anime gem from <UNK> and <UNK> studios it's loosely based on the novel but it reminds me more of the game <UNK> br br if you want to see this see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain japanese the english dubbed version was almost <UNK> and edited to death br br there is not much new despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature to combine cg graphics with hand drawn animation but it's fun to watch nevertheless
<START> i don't doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by <UNK> of a three way split among the <UNK> on the bounty leads of clark gable charles <UNK> and <UNK> tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn't have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn't no split involved in his award br br the movie and the story by liam <UNK> that it is based on involves a poor <UNK> of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish <UNK> army he was <UNK> out of it for some <UNK> stunt he pulled and wants back in he's down to his last <UNK> and if he can't get back in wants enough for passage to america there's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former <UNK> named frankie <UNK> played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and <UNK> <UNK> and informs on <UNK> br br the ira is pretty anxious to find out who <UNK> <UNK> out and they're pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to <UNK> another man named peter <UNK> played by donald meek he also picks up a <UNK> on played by j m <UNK> br br the whole action of the informer takes place in <UNK> in <UNK> from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have <UNK> as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it <UNK> a lot of resemblance to br br john ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it <UNK> was sean <UNK> br br preston foster plays the ira <UNK> dan <UNK> in the book <UNK> is a harder and <UNK> man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and <UNK> will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril br br the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he <UNK> the authority of their court meek ain't in a position to say no the king's justice and <UNK> does not run here it <UNK> illustrates at that point despite <UNK> by army troops and <UNK> the british are indeed losing their grip on the population br br of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every <UNK> br br the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time
<START> black <UNK> is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us <UNK> and much later rest in pieces among others i'm only noting the ones i've seen at any rate we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is <UNK> over a voodoo doll and then <UNK> it and the man <UNK> over not sure if it was good for either of them at that point fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something to that effect and of course everybody else except her is in on something which happens to be devil worship it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times to spice things up though there's a <UNK> <UNK> scene i hope it's <UNK> with a black goat sure to be a crowd <UNK> ugh at times this echoes rosemary's baby minus the baby because the <UNK> is always giving one woman <UNK> tea and the place <UNK> of whatever nasty satanic <UNK> these are too because that keeps getting <UNK> upon however the <UNK> aren't the only thing that <UNK> about this film the end seems to be back to the beginning again and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part it's not unwatchable it's just not very good and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me 3 out of 10
<START> tasteless i can't even write intelligently about the movie i laughed the entire movie it wasn't supposed to be funny matt farnsworth has no clue what he is doing his story is written it seems without any knowledge of <UNK> culture and the <UNK> problem i know farnsworth is from <UNK> which makes his movie even more puzzling to me why do the two main characters have accents it doesn't make any sense the acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch <UNK> violence and sex filled the movie i am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy but it came across as unbelievable and offensive the ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all i could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief as i walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears but it did the exact opposite do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant sappy <UNK> clichéd drivel
<START> modern original romantic story br br very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin br br miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br conclusion good movie br br les pays <UNK> <UNK> points
<START> i haven't seen the first two only this one which is called primal species in england i don't think i'll be bothering to look them out though br br this is an awful film terrible acting bad dialogue cheap rubber monsters everything about it is so nasty the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones especially one called <UNK> who is an incredible jerk no one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got <UNK> off i was having nightmares he was going to survive the colonel was rubbish too all moody <UNK> and clueless shouting and the <UNK> doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno i was waiting for her to take her glasses off shake her hair and turn into a <UNK> but she didn't pity that as it would've <UNK> the film up no end br br didn't roger corman used to make half decent films once
<START> <UNK> rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth unfortunately her role required no she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film <UNK> character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul <UNK> character he did a fantastic job for his performance set in ancient asia both actors were not asian but were very convincing in their roles i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance because that is what <UNK> must have gotten her oscar for she must have been a breakthrough actress one of the first to method act this seems like something that hollywood does often al pacino has played an italian and cuban i felt <UNK> performance to be lackluster throughout and when she died she did not change in expression from any previous scenes she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice if her brilliant acting was so subtle i suppose i did not see it
<START> when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen i'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully <UNK> with live action footage however the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent the visual look including the animation gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece however this was quality of <UNK> was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically <UNK> over the head with most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot it seemed that the plot was shoe <UNK> in at <UNK> <UNK> giving a <UNK> effect that <UNK> <UNK> from the flow of the piece the voice overs from <UNK> especially the one at the end very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in <UNK> holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole <UNK> thing and even that wasn't properly addressed i'm afraid the whole piece came across as at best a <UNK> first <UNK> by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading <UNK> lawrence not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all
<START> it is a well known fact that when gene <UNK> first pitched star trek to nbc the original pilot episode the cage was rejected for being too cerebral when the series was given another chance <UNK> thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as <UNK> and did so by writing the <UNK> which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still at the time an <UNK> episode br br this time rather than exploring a new planet kirk and his crew are on <UNK> 11 paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise christopher <UNK> sean <UNK> now horribly <UNK> and <UNK> because of an accident <UNK> joins his <UNK> on the starship where an unpleasant surprise <UNK> spock who used to serve under <UNK> has effectively <UNK> the <UNK> and set the course for <UNK> iv a planet which is off limits the punishment is death since <UNK> and <UNK> last visit there 13 years earlier naturally being a logical creature spock turns himself in and <UNK> a court martial so that he can justify his actions br br there's no need to say more about the plot since the rest will play out in part 2 what really <UNK> is how <UNK> creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe by coming up with a particular type of flashback to say more would be too much that allows everyone on screen and off to see what could have been of trek had nbc not turned down the original project in particular it's fun to see jeffrey hunter who was unable to return in the <UNK> play <UNK> as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and <UNK> early days as spock whose personality hadn't been fully established yet this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br in short not just a great mystery episode but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down the cage in its original form it's available as part of the season 3 box set
<START> this solid little horror film is actually one of <UNK> <UNK> best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an <UNK> the real horror comes from the prison setting itself and <UNK> h <UNK> no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that <UNK> <UNK> rat <UNK> old <UNK> with a sadistic warden too viggo <UNK> is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very authentic looking prisoners there are no pretty boys in this cast horror fans should check this one out
<START> not sure if i'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director devil hunter sure is one bizarre <UNK> movie br br the plot is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of superior films like cannibal <UNK> and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the <UNK> by a <UNK> of <UNK> ' the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city style halloween costume <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp br br to make matters worse this film has ultra minimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro trash film this one just fell way short br br 2 out of 10 kids
<START> another <UNK> <UNK> flick another movie that was seen for <UNK> rather than actual desire the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the <UNK> were not there in this movie akshay <UNK> and many others but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie br br i was happy with the casting in general except <UNK> <UNK> who once again <UNK> to no limit he does however <UNK> some laughs but these were those standard slapstick non original jokes in fact this whole movie is like playing the <UNK> i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise or even play the odd good beat on the <UNK> for a small time does it its only those who can carry different beats in a nice <UNK> manner for an extended period who are considered great br br which brings us to the other <UNK> the <UNK> hardly requires any talent it has no variations and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances hmm sounds like <UNK> <UNK> good <UNK> but its not a <UNK> that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the <UNK> does br br this movie was like the <UNK> and the <UNK> being played sometimes the <UNK> was played sometimes the <UNK> sometimes both together but mostly the <UNK> played alone and the monkey <UNK> and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got bored br br the movie has some good <UNK> good moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying <UNK> entertaining initially then tolerable then irritating the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on mere <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you haven't watched it watch it on <UNK> it comes in the <UNK> and is really quite funny br br this movie had its moments the actors did a fine job except <UNK> <UNK> who can act though i've seen him in main <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> more than entertains i've said it many time and i'll say it again i really think <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi star comedies especially br br some scenes were really funny such as the <UNK> attempts to impress the girls father the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other br br but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added this mean that once the girl was in the following 45 60 mins was increasingly <UNK> the climax was so bad its almost good category i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it <UNK> br br the movie is also extremely predictable there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag br br the movie follows a <UNK> decline throughout the movies except for the odd <UNK> down or up and then rapidly <UNK> downhill once they have made friends with the girl br br most of the really bad scenes were towards the end one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy also many of the jokes were very very stale and <UNK> of <UNK> the last 10 15 was especially <UNK> and completely <UNK> this movie br br i didn't find <UNK> <UNK> quite the <UNK> she was to play and her acting talent is in serious question especially in view of her non appealing looks if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survive br br technically also this movie was weak with the constant female <UNK> and shoddy lighting and camera work br br the songs except the title track were no good either when the songs played in the 2nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audience br br in all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast and the very low expectations br br avoiding it wont be a bad idea br br and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap <UNK> or something is a must if you pay full <UNK> rates you will feel disappointed br br s lots of stale jokes <UNK> <UNK> last 45 mins and last 15 mins especially bad technically bad songs br br s tries to be more than what it was not the regular cast i'm happier for it <UNK> <UNK> br br s some good scenes towards the beginning title song good acting and cast except <UNK> br br total 4 5 10 i'm trying to be objective here i don't like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> and this movie did meet my very low expectations so i'm giving it the benefit of all doubts on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4
<START> i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing my first reaction was <UNK> god not again ' it's so hip to play a <UNK> these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable for some reason though i stayed and watched it <UNK> the end maybe it was my faith in the actors hoping they'd give me something to cheer about br br and surely ken and helena can act also the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point br br helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and <UNK> pity then again she has a soft side that's just looking for love the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character this was a triumph of acting the movie itself is nothing unique br br see if you are an acting student if you're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one it's sean penn serious oh my that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokes not for <UNK> though
<START> we don't have to lose this movie this is one of the greatest i have ever seen jean pierre <UNK> is amazing more than usual and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the <UNK> <UNK> jean <UNK> is no more on this earth we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most <UNK> french directors you just have to love this masterpiece i'll never forget it br br p s sorry for the english
<START> this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn't funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of <UNK> ernie is a loser but at least i've <UNK> at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is <UNK> mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me br br can someone explain to me how <UNK> head being big is funny it's not even that big i've moved on from characters because they're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don't care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time br br i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive
<START> to borrow from dorothy parker this is not a film to be tossed aside br br lightly it should be thrown with great force br br this is an excruciating mess and i'm a <UNK> fan br br mind numbingly awful br br the mummy returns has much more artistic merit
<START> zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining the zombie make up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget b movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
<START> i was very skeptical about <UNK> my precious time to watch this film i didn't enjoy the first one at all and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports after managing to sit through it all avoid avoid avoid
<START> if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it it's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it's not <UNK> in my opinion it's a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama <UNK> press billed as <UNK> press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has that beautifully <UNK> quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action <UNK> and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually <UNK> but the real star as always is timothy <UNK> surely one of the greatest actors of our time
<START> <UNK> mostly <UNK> classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid <UNK> in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true <UNK> perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors bogdanovich blake <UNK> billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip off of something else this is the high point of <UNK> <UNK> after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off
<START> i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible they are rich little kids who don't have any talent and probably just <UNK> nick to accept them alex has played the drums for one <UNK> i've played for 4 1 2 the movie is terrible and so is the show this is the <UNK> most mixed up comedy that even <UNK> funny i've ever seen it is so stupid it makes me want to <UNK> it is just so crazy that <UNK> would ever accept something like this and so dumb they are <UNK> stupid and weird i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off
<START> i gave this more than a 1 because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it <UNK> some thought and comment from my wife and i the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this god that and christ is our <UNK> stuff the movie and the story line did not need it if as i am you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you <UNK> the movie did a good job of <UNK> the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been
<START> i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty <UNK> before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter <UNK> to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the <UNK> <UNK> show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking <UNK> isn't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty <UNK> is way out of <UNK> league
<START> a fierce shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer <UNK> <UNK> who wrote my beautiful <UNK> this is the best thing he's done since then it's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much they've <UNK> what they have been given and are largely empty <UNK> the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough <UNK> shows her some affection and <UNK> her to the <UNK> of sex he has his own motives but <UNK> treats him with a good deal of compassion this is a film in which people and places feel familiar where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen in some respects it's a bit like sunday bloody sunday but it's an altogether <UNK> piece of work the director roger <UNK> allows scenes to build <UNK> and it is beautifully acted br br as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived in performance and that very fine actor daniel craig displays <UNK> to his character than even <UNK> hasn't <UNK> into if the film strikes a false note it is perhaps in the character of the talentless daughter caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother <UNK> or should that be the other way round and even <UNK> life but she is so well played by <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> you in nevertheless the film is also extremely beautiful to look at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and must rank <UNK> as the best british film of the year
<START> sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and or <UNK> are still getting made these days they've been making these lame jaws copies since the 70s it's not like they're getting any more well liked the idea is still exactly the same so we have an animal that starts murdering people first it takes down some secondary characters then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a couple of <UNK> except for someone who used to be a bit more famous who usually plays a <UNK> one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow usually with an explosion then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive or has laid eggs etc etc <UNK> basically uses the same <UNK> ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation unless you count the fact that the <UNK> is a captain in this one variation in that case your standards are pretty low it's funny that he's played by <UNK> <UNK> though he like totally used to be zorro hell i'll give it a bonus point for that
<START> obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie so don't even look at the credits at the end you'll only hold it against them nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie only 3 were in the theater two passed out after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones the <UNK> were the unemployed worm from star trek 2 the wrath of khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in alien the creators of the movie obviously didn't want to <UNK> the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to <UNK> their lines or in some cases learn to <UNK> the words before filming began some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is if you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you don't pass out you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film the <UNK> of several scenes will just <UNK> you and stephen <UNK> regular <UNK> of the <UNK> mary of curse <UNK> conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this if you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store if there's any justice in the film industry one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you
<START> <UNK> best describes the film adaptation of the best selling philosophical novel the <UNK> prophecy which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in <UNK> home video quality actors present so called characters <UNK> overwrought exposition and <UNK> <UNK> while the film is <UNK> by the extremely heavy handed direction of <UNK> mastroianni even though there are visible attempts at <UNK> up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of <UNK> lost or dan <UNK> the da <UNK> code the filmmakers are hardly up to the task this film <UNK> of ill conceived mass <UNK> spiritual propaganda and the results are so awful few can <UNK> through this mess to spot a real point
<START> a great gangster film sam <UNK> has directed this beautiful movie showing another father son <UNK> brilliant star cast leading with tom hanks michael sullivan has done a terrific job great acting by him again he is an acting legend great acting too from paul newman jude law and daniel craig casting is just too good the plot is quite good you will enjoy the movie a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's set in the 1930's this will surely stand out as the <UNK> of all gangster movies of that era soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie a great flick in <UNK> showing what a father does to protect his son way underrated for my liking deserved a fully deserved 10
<START> i have seen many a horror flick in my time all of them <UNK> bad but none reach the depths that this piece of trash <UNK> itself to this movie made me <UNK> and <UNK> as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about now after i've seen it i understand sort of what was going on and why but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it yes there are the <UNK> scenes of <UNK> violence one liners that show the mind blowing <UNK> of its characters the highway belongs to me me and enough nudity to <UNK> distract us from the plot but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road <UNK>
<START> well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie <UNK> had some bills to pay when taking on this role br br the lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey br br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing br br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden <UNK> for its year
<START> the original vampires 1998 is one of my favorites i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters i was quite surprised at how this played out as a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes vampire <UNK> from the first one in <UNK> jon bon <UNK> was a <UNK> initially but he proved to be a half way decent <UNK> i doubt anyone could top james <UNK> performance in the first one though unless you bring in buffy br br all in all this was a decent watch i would watch it again br br i was left with two questions though what happened to jack crow how did derek bliss come to be a <UNK> guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination
<START> it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film female trouble and i wasn't sure what to expect the second time around br br while the previous film was outrageously over the top pecker is actually a funny film that <UNK> the art critics in new york to a t anyone who cannot imagine what these experts find so appealing about modern art will enjoy seeing these pretentious <UNK> get so full of themselves over pecker a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors br br edward <UNK> pet sematary ii terminator 2 judgment day was surprisingly good as pecker there wasn't a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film but he really shines br br christina <UNK> <UNK> nation comes in with another great performance as <UNK> girlfriend in fact it was a <UNK> year for <UNK> buffalo <UNK> the opposite of sex and pecker br br <UNK> taylor who had the only good role in the haunting was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable br br there are many funny scenes but i have to say the best was when a crown <UNK> screaming we want bush we want bush we want bush i thought it was a <UNK> convention until i saw the police <UNK> off the dancer br br i am going to have to look for more of <UNK> work especially <UNK> now that that is in the news
<START> i went to see this movie actually i went to see family <UNK> which contains cutting moments 2 other short films by douglas buck at the <UNK> del <UNK> festival <UNK> i just couldn't watch it i had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a <UNK> every once in a while by the time it was over my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun btw of course i was not the only one who left the room it was <UNK> too violent and disgusting for me i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it i just don't get how you can love that kind of movies the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days i also try to analyze the story my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it and i just don't think it makes any sense i mean that amount of violence and stuff makes no other sense than to try to shock people and that's not a good enough reason i think there's absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say well at least <UNK> thing about it was good but well i guess i will never understand that kind of films
<START> although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn't very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all once you beat it you'll want to <UNK> your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two <UNK> time a must own for any <UNK> 64 owner and is a reason in itself to own a <UNK> 64
<START> unless i'm sadly mistaken i rented a nightmare on elm street 3 several years ago and there was a music video i'm pretty sure which was called dream warriors at the end of it and i rented this one on dvd hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen it's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos there was this rap group singing that song dream warriors on the vhs version of this movie after the credits and they're all wearing like <UNK> <UNK> with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all <UNK> at the <UNK> like daisy dukes what could make a rap group look more foolish i can't imagine br br spoilers at any rate i was disappointed in looking for that video on the dvd version so all i had was this mediocre installment in the freddy krueger series the movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2 with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a <UNK> and finding himself with the bloody hands <UNK> parker patricia arquette has a nightmare about the infamous house that nancy thompson used to live in then runs to the bathroom the <UNK> handles turn into freddy's hands and attack her and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having <UNK> her own <UNK> from there the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment br br <UNK> fishburne tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice guy <UNK> stern but <UNK> when the patients want to bend the rules a little not surprisingly he turns in what is by leaps and <UNK> the best performance in the movie arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor but had not <UNK> her acting skills when she starred in this film the characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that <UNK> is placed into after cutting her <UNK> all of them are cynical and <UNK> almost none believing that they really belong there at all eventually they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group <UNK> br br heather <UNK> has returned in her famous role as nancy thompson this time grown up into a dream <UNK> as a result of her childhood experiences involving freddy krueger not surprisingly she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical <UNK> and the rest of the patients since she had experienced exactly what they're going through there are some interesting murders in this installment and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump there is a gigantic worm like freddy that tries to swallow <UNK> whole there is a scene where a television turns into freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and <UNK> her for sitting too close to the tv but there is also an unconvincing go motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with freddy <UNK> <UNK> which has been rotting in the <UNK> of some car in a car <UNK> and one of the more <UNK> inducing scenes was one where freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream the one famous for <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet <UNK> br br we get a <UNK> into freddy's past in this installment not only do we meet his mother but we also find out the circumstances that led to freddy being <UNK> by more than 100 <UNK> in fighting freddy the patients all band together and in their dreams use their special powers most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life to fight him one student bound to a wheelchair is able to walk in his dreams another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the wizard master ' another is beautiful and <UNK> she has lots of makeup her hair stands up in a foot high <UNK> and she has knives clever but the movie <UNK> when it has only one of the patients the one who can't speak not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams at just the right moment to save the day his dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long but <UNK> now you see why the movie was subtitled dream warriors br br altogether this is not an entirely weak entry into the series the acting is pretty shoddy but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie larry fishburne vastly <UNK> the rest of the cast displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two  a problem that <UNK> the friday the 13th movies much more than the elm street films the characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil but then again not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives but it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost <UNK> the best <UNK>
<START> as far as horror flicks go this one is pretty darn good while it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you're into the horror comedy genre
<START> take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative <UNK> history and you get aztec rex apparently <UNK> <UNK> before <UNK> the aztec empire had to first <UNK> a <UNK> rex and her mate that's the thrust of this movie given the plot it could have really sucked the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers there are a few problems for starters <UNK> is played by ian <UNK> even with a black wig <UNK> as <UNK> is about as convincing as <UNK> rose playing gandhi and though <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> peoples of mexico the <UNK> here seem to be played by an all <UNK> ensemble casting aside the t rex <UNK> look reasonably good though every time one of them gets shot it just <UNK> cgi and they die too easily i suppose if a t rex were around in real life they probably could be <UNK> or at least wounded by some rather <UNK> <UNK> century <UNK> but it takes something away from the movie there are also some graphic t rex <UNK> human scenes which is surprising but in this context i thought they worked ok there's plenty of action and the whole <UNK> angle is prevalent throughout but doesn't <UNK> the dinosaur angle unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie <UNK> overall a mediocre but decent by scifi original standards movie that rates a modest 4
<START> if you like bad movies this is the one to see it's incredibly low budget special effects you'll see what i mean and use of non actors was what gave this film it's charm if you're bored with a group of friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem it's <UNK>
<START> there are two things that i like about elvira and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she <UNK> attention looking like a combined clone of <UNK> adams and anna nicole smith she <UNK> a distant <UNK> estate only to discover that she is really the <UNK> of the occult the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling it's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the <UNK> mob or the fleeing heroine who <UNK> and stumbles on her heels my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous <UNK> to break the chains keeping her locked in the <UNK> the ending is <UNK> sweet as if it were written by the <UNK> but the las vegas act at the end seems too <UNK> for this type of movie
<START> ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean <UNK> camp they are tortured we learn north korean <UNK> are bad people we learn <UNK> <UNK> grow very slowly during days of torture br br i tried to <UNK> it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the <UNK> he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of <UNK> next acting stone cold sober he takes a drunken companion <UNK> martin to get <UNK> to cure mr <UNK> <UNK> of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk <UNK> the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a <UNK> which is next to a bunch of empty boxes i'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it otherwise it's <UNK> br br prisoner of war 1954 andrew <UNK> ronald reagan steve forrest <UNK> martin
<START> i disagree with anyone who <UNK> like this movie br br i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it's sweet funny and <UNK> your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed br br and even though it didn't have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up br br oh yeah and it proves that your deepest <UNK> and dreams can come true tear tear br br i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it
<START> thirty years after its initial release the third version of a star is born finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist <UNK> woman in the moon from this 1976 film easy to dismiss the movie's career <UNK> story is such a <UNK> pile of hollywood style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including <UNK> own funny girl this time <UNK> to the then contemporary music scene the <UNK> plot follows self destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break br br troubles dog their <UNK> from the outset as john norman both names please responds to <UNK> fans and <UNK> <UNK> with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes <UNK> to john norman esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the <UNK> decent creative musician underneath the <UNK> in the movie's most pivotal scene he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off inevitably he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her <UNK> success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest directed by frank <UNK> although <UNK> budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative it still has a certain emotional <UNK> despite its numerous flaws br br although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and <UNK> to play esther <UNK> the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make <UNK> for her <UNK> adult contemporary oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of <UNK> rock from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the <UNK> she can't help but come across as an established star i can forgive the <UNK> simply because she is an <UNK> vocal talent but what becomes less <UNK> is how she makes esther more <UNK> than poignant when john <UNK> <UNK> become overwhelming this creates an oddly <UNK> dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than <UNK> response to it this is <UNK> off by an <UNK> eight minute close up of her <UNK> performance great except when she <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> style toward the end br br kristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes <UNK> his <UNK> feelings of love pride and <UNK> toward esther he makes his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work within this context otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are <UNK> to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were <UNK> with the two principals the only ones who register are paul <UNK> as john <UNK> level headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager <UNK> veteran cameraman robert <UNK> provides a nice <UNK> to the cinematography though a level of <UNK> <UNK> in the print a big <UNK> in its day the soundtrack is a <UNK> of different styles from the 1970's some songs still quite good everything woman in the moon watch closely now some that have moved to <UNK> queen <UNK> kenny <UNK> i believe in love and of course the <UNK> <UNK> br br the print transfer on the 2006 dvd is clean and the sound <UNK> crisp thanks to digital <UNK> <UNK> participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature length commentary she gives insightful information about the <UNK> of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production she is also <UNK> <UNK> about the <UNK> of jon peters her <UNK> boyfriend who became the movie's producer and her <UNK> with <UNK> as a director i just wish she could have provided more scene specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen she also tends to repeat the same <UNK> when the mood strikes her e g it gets <UNK> to hear for the third time how the person playing the <UNK> was a friend of peters i think having a second <UNK> could have drawn out other <UNK> from her br br there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes especially <UNK> mixed fabric <UNK> and orange <UNK> shirt there are also twelve deleted scenes included with <UNK> <UNK> commentary one is a comic bread <UNK> scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in <UNK> comedies another is an extended scene in which she plays <UNK> on the guitar in front of an <UNK> kristofferson who then falls asleep the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale <UNK> fast cuts which i agree with streisand should have been used <UNK> the theatrical trailers for all three versions of a star is born are also included
<START> i watched this movie <UNK> my complete family of nine since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goings on the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple thankfully this time all indian locales like <UNK> <UNK> etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the <UNK> hence adding to the connection with movie the dialogues are much better than those in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a supposedly dialogue based movie the background music is <UNK> the soft focus of the movie it somehow remind me of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in which <UNK> and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department looks or acting the supporting cast are too good i rate the actress playing the role of <UNK> in the front league the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters songs were too <UNK> the scenes and going along well with the movie however though i respect <UNK> <UNK> for his body of work from movies to <UNK> i missed ram <UNK> badly br br it had no double <UNK> <UNK> category no <UNK> no intrigue and no nonsense you would <UNK> watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged i want to express on <UNK> thing here that though <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally <UNK> the movie is only about <UNK> <UNK> rest of the characters are incidental art <UNK> life the <UNK> characters are <UNK> to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair br br coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part the situation of tragedy was <UNK> created the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all that is why it lacks the emotional punch the very purpose of this turn of events but a twist in the tale was necessary to <UNK> the movie from a beautiful pre marital video to a <UNK> <UNK> but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came the preaching by <UNK> <UNK> and later by <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> was out of place and it made things too overboard may be this will help the movie a tax free status but the plot could have been made more interesting and non linear than what it was br br there were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended 2 has the movie ended
<START> this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the <UNK> of seeing in the theater although he is my favorite when i heard he was going to play a hit man i was a little stunned thinking can mr hanks pull this one off and he did in high fashion this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty redemption and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan being the family man and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and <UNK> rather than dialogue which he delivers a <UNK> performance br br on one night of one of his jobs michael's son michael jr played by newcomer tyler <UNK> witnesses the hit and michael sr 's partner in crime fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out so he <UNK> out the son and wife of michael sr except michael jr so the two head for chicago to get <UNK> rooney son of paul <UNK> mr rooney br br the drama and intense plot really <UNK> from their as father <UNK> to set things right even though son is along for the ride while on this deadly journey someone has hired a hit for michael sr the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased <UNK> maguire played by a <UNK> <UNK> jude law br br the movie will have you feeling the old days and with thomas <UNK> beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam <UNK> so sit back and enjoy the wild ride
<START> well i'll start with the good points the movie was only <UNK> minutes long and some of it was so bad it was funny now for the low points my first warning sign came with an actual warning on the film when it started the following warning was displayed the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun pretty or romantic i should have saved myself the <UNK> minutes and turned it off then the first words of the film were i'm at the <UNK> factory it was some guy talking on his phone and he was referring to a <UNK> home as a <UNK> factory i don't know why so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the <UNK> cameras they could find the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script that's what is looked like they were doing the script was horrible and the big twist was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes without any more painful details of the plot here were some horrible highlights of the movie they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an army of one because soldiers are really just murderers then they tried to make an attempt at satanic worship by showing some guys in black <UNK> in a meeting the great computer <UNK> was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address i'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use <UNK> com there was also a random <UNK> to 9 11 for no reason i also learned that no matter where you get shot blood will come out of your mouth within seconds br br so if you like really bad acting sub par scripts bad camera work and an obvious plot you'll love zodiac killer
<START> if you are already a fan of peter <UNK> wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties you will really enjoy this movie if you have ever seen the 1966 modesty blaise film forget it that was camp this is the real modesty blaise the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love it's a long way from joe <UNK> 1966 travesty and it takes our modesty quite seriously alexandra <UNK> is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt chuckle br br this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty her childhood and her days with <UNK> br br since peter <UNK> was the creative <UNK> on the movie everything really rings true even the story <UNK> told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it having read all the books i enjoyed the movie even more for that br br now that <UNK> has kept their option on the property by having quentin <UNK> make this film i do hope to see more of the modesty stories <UNK> especially as the wonderful character of willie <UNK> makes <UNK> character really come alive to that end i really hope the film does well in europe i have no idea if <UNK> <UNK> to ever <UNK> the dvd in the usa i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution i wonder how <UNK> decides where and how to <UNK> it's films br br in the story modesty is in her early <UNK> working at <UNK> casino in <UNK> the flashback sequences are <UNK> done and take modesty from about 9 years old through her teens up to her current age in the movie about 21 22 i'd guess i really don't think there's a perfect actress for modesty for many of us modesty fans she's much too powerful a presence in our <UNK> already alexandra <UNK> is credible she is very slim <UNK> and <UNK> she has lots of closeups she has a great face one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over according to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> romero modesty has rather a fuller figure than <UNK> but i'm willing to overlook that if <UNK> continues in the role i think she will mature into it just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older <UNK> already conveys <UNK> humor and absolute <UNK> very well go ahead and rent this movie it's not like anything else you've seen and even though it was directed by scott <UNK> it is full of <UNK> touches great camera moves lighting and well done action sequences
<START> way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a <UNK> cannibal into a soft <UNK> drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasn't close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing as if you would've had to try what the hell was this writer director thinking here's one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar <UNK> rapes and lengthy <UNK> flashbacks to alone time in his old <UNK> house i think <UNK> was actually trying to present or <UNK> 'the soft <UNK> of j dahmer
<START> in holland a gay writer gerard <UNK> <UNK> gives a lecture he stays overnight with a beautiful woman christine <UNK> <UNK> and has sex with her by imagining she's a boy he plans to leave the next day but gets a look at a picture of <UNK> hunky boyfriend herman <UNK> hoffman and decides to stay to have a try at him then things get strange br br a big x rated art house hit in the us in 1983 why was it x rated let's see there's <UNK> full frontal male and female nudity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sex a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people a gay sex scene in a crypt and it's all a comedy paul verhoeven made this after <UNK> <UNK> was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and <UNK> as trash so verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it he was right critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them still it's a great film br br it's beautifully shot by jan de <UNK> now a director himself and there's so much symbolism and obvious hidden layers in the dialogue that you're never bored all the acting is great <UNK> plays a thoroughly despicable character but somehow has you rooting for him <UNK> is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection the little smile she gives when gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with <UNK> in the crypt br br this is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart but if you like extreme movies that <UNK> challenge you like me this is for you a 10 all the way
<START> this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer stupid script bad casting endless boredom br br in the usual tradition of hollywood the government of the us is shown as always evil the communist <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks love taking the lone <UNK> eugene mccarthy and <UNK> him as the leader of a vast movement the truth is that at the time he was considered a <UNK> character who was <UNK> a legitimate concern about the soviet <UNK> for political gain br br oh yeah and the us brought over all those evil nazis like <UNK> <UNK> without whom we would have no space program he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country br br and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood an <UNK> lot who live a fantasy existence still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want and yet this is the same government that they continually portray as a <UNK> evil in films like this
<START> this is what i wrote to some friends earlier br br holy crap the grudge is honest to god one of the scariest films i've ever seen i am either getting very soft in my old age or sam <UNK> and ghost pictures did a kick a job can't wait for boogeyman br br i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone anyone sitting next to me except the protagonist in grudge i saw the movie by myself i swear there were many many jump scenes that were not expected i felt foolish but my nerves did not care i was on edge the entire movie from the opening credits and the music was fantastically scary i keep thinking of that sound though and i do not like it br br i actually <UNK> <UNK> a few times and cried oh at one scene oh yeah i even half covered my eyes a few times word to the wise though i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic my <UNK> hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho but i don't remember the movie so can't compare br br i can't say i enjoyed this movie b c i was terrified but it was very very good and scary the ending scene too <UNK> for being a <UNK> year old <UNK> i think i may have nightmares from this movie especially because of that sound please get out of my head br br in summary this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with jason freddy this is a most of the time spooky movie perfect for halloween br br two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2

<START> now i don't hate cheap movies i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your <UNK> camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some <UNK> tapes br br maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn't maybe i hate it because it's cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom <UNK> can't save this br br seriously this one is a complete waste of time

<START> this is a <UNK> film br br the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown <UNK> by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of <UNK> and <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> his inspiration to <UNK> film 8 1 2 but whereas fellini is a <UNK> of world cinema <UNK> is not br br he has none of the <UNK> <UNK> of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a <UNK> of clarity br br he is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored br br as for the women only two can be described as <UNK> <UNK> played by polly walker and <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> the rest <UNK> with <UNK> both the women and the men <UNK> from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy br br <UNK> obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money relations between men and women are <UNK> into a commercial <UNK> br br there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant br br the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son philip and <UNK> <UNK> played respectively by john standing and matthew <UNK> the <UNK> disregard of both men that <UNK> is carrying their child she in fact gets pregnant twice the first <UNK> being <UNK> and the second time she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book both men having sex with a woman who has no legs the half woman in the title the <UNK> that exists between <UNK> played by amanda plummer with a pig named <UNK> father and son sharing women between them women enjoying being beaten sexually the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife br br mercifully none of these scenes are shown sexually only hinted at br br the hinted <UNK> of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was <UNK> at when it was first premiered at cannes what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film <UNK> up to defend it showing yet again that there is no limit to the <UNK> of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men br br <UNK> directorial style is pretentious it is a triumph of style over substance a depiction of film as art accompanied by the <UNK> of common sense br br <UNK> tries to <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> but only succeeds in showing the <UNK> of human relationships
<START> the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film <UNK> street in <UNK> but it could really be in any place the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner the film is not about <UNK> or the <UNK> leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love reflected in most of the main characters br br alfred <UNK> and <UNK> novak are <UNK> partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and <UNK> and romance and the story <UNK> to bring these two aspects together beautifully hugo <UNK> the owner of the shop is having trouble with his wife she only a voice at the end of the phone <UNK> <UNK> has a secret affair <UNK> <UNK> has a gentleman friend who buys her fur <UNK> mr <UNK> life is <UNK> around his wife and children <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> santa <UNK> to a girl at christmas you even sense that quiet <UNK> <UNK> while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone br br the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama it moves effortlessly from scene to scene it is one of those quiet films that <UNK> looking at again and again simple yet profound the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days br br all the acting is magnificent even the minor characters like the <UNK> in the <UNK> and the policeman in the street are perfect james stewart and margaret <UNK> play off each other perfectly he was really getting into his <UNK> as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance margaret <UNK> was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days some of her other films are worth catching as mr <UNK> frank morgan is amazing his moment of truth is very moving gold stars all round to the performers br br it is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to the vague re make <UNK> got <UNK> was dire but in this case it is true the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit charm and warm humanity
<START> i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again i wonder why i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the <UNK> films but about a third of the way through whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me <UNK> the film asks us to start taking it seriously not only that but the central rock club and <UNK> sequences are very forced and just look stilted in short this is neither as <UNK> silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend richard <UNK> maybe as such a central figure could have helped but i <UNK> this to be one of his worst performances just worth it for the ladies
<START> neil simon's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays felix <UNK> and oscar madison were the <UNK> paired roommates in the original the former being <UNK> and neat the latter being <UNK> and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack <UNK> and sam <UNK> as al lewis and willie clark the aged semi retired <UNK> here the apartment problem is reduced to a <UNK> of two men who can't stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as al br br in <UNK> al probably does not think totally badly of willie willie is <UNK> on the subject of al first al had little <UNK> such as accidentally spitting slightly when <UNK> words beginning with the letter t and slightly <UNK> willie with his <UNK> finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to <UNK> and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie can't remember lines unless they are funny and keeps <UNK> them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial br br ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is <UNK> on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the <UNK> of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie <UNK> <UNK> neck br br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the one liners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville <UNK> example chest pains i'm getting chest pains uncle willie every <UNK> i come here and get chest pains so come on <UNK> benjamin <UNK> to prove his deep affection for his uncle although <UNK> rough outer shell makes it difficult he only <UNK> down when he <UNK> the glory days of vaudeville matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems <UNK> by his repeating himself but in <UNK> <UNK> sense of <UNK> by the world that once <UNK> him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not <UNK> he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement br br i call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie <UNK> their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the <UNK> willie admits that al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny man br br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly <UNK> of the team smith and <UNK> jack benny was benny probably would have done a good job but ill health forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold <UNK> in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife <UNK> allan
<START> if it wasn't for some immature <UNK> idiot i know <UNK> that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments one in particular is where the <UNK> police soldiers arrest don <UNK> for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away still filming presumably to his <UNK> hotel then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and <UNK> nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion br br i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has 5 8 10 i thought imdb users had more sense
<START> nothing happens br br then characters with no personality don't develop br br then the end never comes because there's no beginning and no middle br br there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be because this movie isn't even there there's no is in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point there's nothing br br there is a good point it has a good soundtrack but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time so if you're really interested i'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something you'll get everything you can from this movie without all the <UNK> headache and <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> one star that's all this documentary deserves i haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time br br i'm a big fan of the walking with series including it's <UNK> marvin spin offs for all their <UNK> fun yet informative information and although the subject of <UNK> man has never interested me nearly as much as other <UNK> creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other <UNK> from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places br br well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lol br br though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly <UNK> in what it was trying to say with information <UNK> and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects and <UNK> mtv style camera effects br br speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the <UNK> come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man in suit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions br br the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesn't even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the <UNK> <UNK> that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it it's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story even one that is just <UNK> you care more about the facts surrounding it br br the only saving <UNK> of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the bbc version i saw and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which i did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with <UNK> br br and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm
<START> well sorry for the mistake on the one line summary run people run this movie is an horror imagine gary busey in another low budget movie with an incredibly bad scenario isn't that a nightmare no well yes it is <UNK> run i give it out of
<START> a study in bad bad acting bad music bad screenplay bad editing bad direction and a bad idea pieces of schlock don't come any <UNK> or unintentionally funnier than this thing by the end of the movie you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place poor malcolm mcdowell was he short of cash or something still thinking of seeing this spoilers <UNK> if you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes by the time you'll see the cyborg populated town named <UNK> you will avoid this my movie loving friends avoid
<START> upon viewing tobe <UNK> gem crocodile in 2000 i developed a great interest in the college crocodile <UNK> of the exploitation monster genre i look forward to a <UNK> producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful <UNK> of camp goodness if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts with ed writing the scripts and a room full of <UNK> creating crocodile special effects on a computer all we'd need would be a cast of <UNK> fodder with russ meyer breasts and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br while tobe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his own movies blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the <UNK> bucket of other movies see if you can look past the revenge of the <UNK> sequel sets to find the <UNK> <UNK> rip offs to jaws temple of doom indiana jones' last <UNK> the convent godzilla 2000 and any james bond movie also try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock br br i was disappointed the <UNK> didn't get to try out its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> on <UNK> or <UNK> appreciation but the quasi captain <UNK> of the story does get his tour de force <UNK> perhaps in the coming years we'll see a <UNK> <UNK> off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will <UNK> a <UNK> down the toilet of an international space station for <UNK> and enjoy the exploitative <UNK> of zero g monkey midget crocodile bloodshed br br all in all the lack of a <UNK> bar in the surf music <UNK> me
<START> cult classics are nearly impossible to predict who could guess that vision quest fight club and 2001 a space <UNK> movies that were <UNK> by critics and audiences alike upon their release would become immensely popular like many <UNK> i consider myself a movie expert unlike the majority of those who hated envy <UNK> by a dismal 4 4 rating i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade br br the plot of the movie is ridiculous the dialogue isn't clever the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth <UNK> but that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious you see in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically detached point of view br br why do i love envy because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good this is the recipe for a cult classic and envy definitely fits the bill
<START> <UNK> <UNK> plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene having partial <UNK> or global <UNK> which one character claims to define as <UNK> loss of memory the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of <UNK> his life back together <UNK> <UNK> very loosely based on walter <UNK> book fallen angel filmed in 1965 as <UNK> with gregory peck it was probably too <UNK> for television what with drugs and hippies added to the mix that nbc initially refused to air it which is how this low <UNK> wound up in theaters director james <UNK> gets freaky with the <UNK> visuals and camera tricks while editor edward a <UNK> goes wild with the <UNK> <UNK> cuts unfortunately their admittedly colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot and the acting is woefully <UNK> <UNK> under pressure to recall the events of the night in question goes through an actor's <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> nose <UNK> and crazy half laughs while spitting out dialogue like dream a dream drugs yeah drugs that sound <UNK> help as a villainous fellow scientist with a <UNK> cat smile pat <UNK> nearly <UNK> <UNK> in the grand <UNK> department by continually addressing everyone in baby talk <UNK> about like a middle aged <UNK> and <UNK> his mouth around in agony hope <UNK> scientist love interest is given the short <UNK> but not before she screams at indifferent lover <UNK> what do i have to do talk ape man me want you this is one frantic jigsaw 1 2 from
<START> basically i like verhoeven film because in his film i enjoy a brilliant <UNK> story that i have seen before in basic instinct it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much so it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie br br well it is his previous direction before his block buster hit basic instinct and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah the movie has <UNK> my hope and expectation br br this movie the fourth man is a brilliant <UNK> drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences the story of this movie is about a gay writer named <UNK> <UNK> an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident after the end of his lecture he introduce a seductive woman named christine who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal <UNK> do sex with her at her house as she is a boy next morning he watch her sexy macho <UNK> picture on her table the person he met at the station he is curious to meet him and tell christine to invite him to her house br br that's it i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising br br especially i like the character <UNK> which is brilliantly played by <UNK> i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face br br i would like thanks mr verhoeven to make such a black comedy br br i rate this movie 10 out of 10
<START> ya that is what i think sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without br br i love having c j and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together br br when john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do now br br it is too bad that no more are being made i don't think because i would love to see some new material br br my favorite character must be <UNK> poor <UNK> is almost always left out it is always about bridget or carrie what about <UNK> honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it i almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle
<START> i saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one i think it was the latter first of all it was inaccurate in many small yet important details one of the first things i noticed was during <UNK> day to day life in his work his conversations eating in the <UNK> etc he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive <UNK> at people without immense fear one of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment this is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the <UNK> in the book winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip while in the movie he does it so often and without fear that you lose the important feeling of heavy <UNK> and risk right off the bat br br other minor inaccuracies included winston hiding his diary in the wall yes a very small change but it begs the question what's the point there was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book and that is <UNK> characters br br the large inaccuracies were far more disturbing however first of all one of the important pieces of the book is that big brother is a government based on an intelligent yet crude philosophy in the movie they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by hitler with technology which is true in a sense when directed with its <UNK> but if that's all you get out of big brother you really missed the point of the book the terrifying thing about big brother is that in a way it has some points behind its philosophy when o'brien is picking at <UNK> mind in the <UNK> of love he is listening to everything winston says against big brother the fact that he <UNK> and advances forward in his philosophy is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing in the end careful spoiler ahead when winston says he loves big brother the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was <UNK> the beating and torture that caused this or the actual power behind the philosophy i am in no way saying that the big brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing br br also how could anyone feel any connection between julia and winston in the film it was awful no connection whatsoever br br and where was o'brien before he gave winston his address one of the things that carried the book was <UNK> thoughts about o'brien before he made contact with him in the movie they just jump the gun br br but that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption because its impossible not to jump the gun and <UNK> characters in less than two hours how could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours at the very least the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important <UNK> and connections anything less is just pointless br br if you loved the book and i mean truly <UNK> it you will not <UNK> of this movie and chances are you already knew you wouldn't because the book is <UNK> and this movie just proves how impossible it is <UNK> something decent into a small reel of film br br two stars out of ten
<START> as an native of <UNK> this film has obvious appeal for me the location shots are fascinating and show a <UNK> very much in transition there are a number of scenes of apparent <UNK> but this serves to show the town being <UNK> and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a <UNK> that <UNK> into a full blown <UNK> conflict then a <UNK> <UNK> resolution though i'm a bit too young to remember it fully the <UNK> of <UNK> life in the 60s is all here <UNK> up on a friday songs round the piano the sunday <UNK> good <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> the massive importance of self respect and i was pleased to see <UNK> funniest lines from the play left intact there is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on dvd it is well crafted and most performances are well realised
<START> i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that my girl friend turned to me and said we have to go see this movie enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying <UNK> <UNK> and bad music there was absolutely no character development br br the plot is just well there was no plot it was basically i know we will <UNK> a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer that's brilliant hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless that main character the <UNK> god <UNK> she annoyed me her longest line must have been half a sentence and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression br br please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this and if your like me and don't have a choice well then i wish you good luck maybe <UNK> in an <UNK> or magazine can't believe this film got made
<START> i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first cigarette burns was by far the best from season 1 and i did like other episodes from that season oh how i was disappointed br br in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing the characters aside from the subject matter seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker texas ranger the acting was bad and i normally like ron <UNK> a lot but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible i'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror obviously with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion in this case not surprisingly it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as <UNK> anti <UNK> and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid <UNK> this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing br br while i don't think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the <UNK> and therefore has that to be held responsible for there are a couple small bits that i found nice hence the 2 stars i gave it br br the actual gore and monster effects were good but the cgi gore two separate <UNK> to the head were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should've never been given the ok i'm generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle i have a problem with the execution of it the technology while amazing in some respects is not good enough to match real effects whether they be <UNK> or gore especially when it is supposed to match something <UNK> and or alive and therefore shouldn't be used until they are cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated br br i'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title masters of horror is a bad title to have there simply aren't many actual masters of horror around maybe two or three if the show were called tale of horror or something like that it would be fine but as it stands the <UNK> for directing one of these episodes and therefore being criticized for not being a master of horror is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career and it didn't even have to be a good one
<START> i couldn't relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or <UNK> the dialogue was very dense and <UNK> i couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it br br i've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic <UNK> i'll admit that as an <UNK> i probably am unfamiliar with many of the <UNK> details of <UNK> but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on <UNK> knowledge or beliefs
<START> when an attempt is made to <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> an arab <UNK> visiting washington d c his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the <UNK> section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda br br a map we see shows <UNK> lying on the borders of <UNK> <UNK> and south <UNK> in an area of <UNK> desert known as the rub al <UNK> or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero <UNK> value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that <UNK> is of immense <UNK> importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its <UNK> it <UNK> that the <UNK> has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his <UNK> <UNK> new job is just a <UNK> to ensure that the <UNK> has further opportunities to meet her br br a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for <UNK> satire on their country's foreign policy this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried forty nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the iran <UNK> affair its tone might have been different br br the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of <UNK> and charm sunny is a typical goldie character pretty sweet natured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with <UNK> and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from <UNK> on the other hand she is a 35 year old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of <UNK> farm grown up and working as a bunny girl br br the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or <UNK> is no better than his her material and <UNK> is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blue eyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley <UNK> kinski film <UNK> about a <UNK> middle eastern <UNK> who kidnaps a young american woman and the mini series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the film makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter day mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a <UNK> of political wisdom and starts <UNK> all sorts of <UNK> about democracy and the <UNK> and the <UNK> duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal <UNK> blah blah <UNK> but in truth the film is no more successful as a political <UNK> than it is as a comedy br br goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as <UNK> flower overboard and <UNK> but <UNK> is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 3 10
<START> let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies i never watch them br br let me tell you about my experience br br the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feet br br i never saw happy feet but i am sure it is better than this movie anyway we didn't actually expect it to be good we actually went in just to laugh at it cool with me i have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out it did not matter br br after 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into <UNK> a movie i would have gladly seen again over this the movie was not scary and not stupid so it would be funny it was just boring it wasn't terrible like baby <UNK> terrible it was terrible like not entertaining at all avoid br br now i am no expert but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg 13 horror that is boring and not scary or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people br br you want a pg 13 horror that sucks but is funny see the grudge avoid this movie like the plague because it may literally bore you to death br br 0 10
<START> i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre it was actually sold out i actually went to see <UNK> instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002 br br victor <UNK> john <UNK> a tough <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and <UNK> all of his money with jack peter <UNK> things seem to be going pretty well until jack <UNK> town with his girlfriend <UNK> denise richards this happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist but they did so it's not br br in fact there's not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview if you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps go to the website <UNK> the preview save yourself 3 99 there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack is br br i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired twice most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria <UNK> <UNK> and i may <UNK> the fabric of the space time <UNK> with a concept as mind numbing as this they both had less talent and musical ability br br the acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and denise richards is at best <UNK> <UNK> and 33 <UNK> bag you know things are bad when john <UNK> he was in the <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the cast with his acting abilities
<START> this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do the original kicked some major tire <UNK> butt this horrible disaster breaks the <UNK> rule of bruckheimer films which is we all know they suck but they have great action this film has no action this film is boring where are the cars where are the chases where's the tension where's the suspense where's the rush where this isn't really a movie at all it's a bad commercial 50 cars in 24 hours that is wrong they have 3 days to steal them the ad is wrong how bad is that the leads acting is stiff wooden and forced the villain the cop the others who cares they utter their pointless lines they serve the illogical plot they <UNK> through it the best they can as the music video director says don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is or we'll fix it with lots of loud music the script isn't really a script at all it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of warning possible spoiler 5 4 3 2 1 the fugitive the biggest crime of all is the <UNK> of <UNK> jones man this is the <UNK> coolest <UNK> since jules in pulp fiction and what do they do they make him a mute who's hardly in the film make <UNK> the main villain and he could have saved the film how could they have been so dumb how how why the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away the original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers go find the original or if you're <UNK> some real car chase action go rent <UNK> the chases in <UNK> raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged bruckheimer and cage had all that money all those resources all that experience and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for 250 000 how can that be you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie where i was once excited to see <UNK> ugly remember the <UNK> and pearl harbor now i say god help us all br br
<START> tries to be funny and fails miserably the animation is just terrible looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep plot is dull and cliched if you have a young child maybe rent it but don't waste hard earned money to pay to see it br br 1 10
<START> whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point jane is a silly comic strip to <UNK> without being sleazy br br this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a <UNK> there is not one decent performance in it even the usually reliable <UNK> <UNK> is painfully unfunny br br the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as <UNK> as he was in flash gordon br br <UNK> adams tries as a <UNK> but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable she is not kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better br br i've <UNK> more entertaining things than this down the toilet avoid
<START> why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome everyone should know what an excellent movie this is it is engaging and funny from moment one original and well acted i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves br br for anyone that loved the princess bride <UNK> and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones robert deniro is hysterical relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man claire danes is fantastic as always michelle <UNK> is making quite a <UNK> with her recent returns to the screen there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters even down to facial expressions
<START> this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge fine casting especially the choice of scott who plays the role to the <UNK> a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption a modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> this film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that gerard depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years his performance shocks entertains <UNK> and charms you while leaving you breathless this film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw but still is able to convey the <UNK> of depardieu a must see for any depardieu fan and by far his best early work
<START> i didn't really know what this movie was about when i went to the theater to see it hype about the <UNK> etc etc etc as the trailers in the last movie i saw looked pretty interesting br br oh dear roman catholic mythology not my idea of a good scare and honestly i just felt like watching a really good scary movie not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes br br i'll try to keep away from the spoilers but i found it very odd that an <UNK> who gets a string of <UNK> <UNK> from a deceased priest could suddenly end up with <UNK> wounds aren't <UNK> supposed to be deeply religious i mean she hangs out with losers does loser stuff behaves like a typical rebel et al and here she is displaying the wounds of jesus christ come on br br scenes of her <UNK> head thrown back screaming blood everywhere became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times it was neither frightening or scary just repulsive it did however become quite painful to watch those <UNK> scenes were highly annoying br br conclusion if your a catholic <UNK> don't see this if you're not still don't see it
<START> i too loved this series when i was a kid in <UNK> i was 5 and my family always watched this show my favorite character was the one played by marion <UNK> as a rather <UNK> bumbling and very lovable aunt type person i can still recall her <UNK> <UNK> um um type comments as she would try and say something important and then when she came back and played aunt clara in <UNK> it was great casting br br it was the first time that i can remember seeing walter matthau whose career i followed as a fan for many many years br br i have a question if anyone can <UNK> was the title or end credits music the swedish <UNK> by hugo <UNK> every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in southern california it brings back memories of the image of mr <UNK> walking away with his back to the camera i'm not even certain if this image in my <UNK> eye is correct
<START> diana <UNK> appears on star trek for the second time but this time as a different character no one on board seems to notice maybe it was the hair regardless this time she is not the <UNK> for a god see the previous episode but is a very famous lady with magical powers that <UNK> her to communicate and see a <UNK> without going crazy the standard human response unfortunately the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the <UNK> <UNK> who oddly lives in a small <UNK> this is a lousy way to travel and unfortunately <UNK> isn't wound all that well herself what happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time i saw it i was pretty <UNK> watching all the men on board go <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> was pretty silly and the acting of spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy do yourself a favor if you haven't seen the show before pick a different episode
<START> <UNK> lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big <UNK> executive <UNK> the president of <UNK> inc by on the <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> who's living the life of <UNK> or <UNK> in his beach house in <UNK> mexico having this cd that he gave to his brother james that has three years of phone conversations between <UNK> and the president of the united states involved in criminal deals this cd has given david an edge over the international <UNK> who are after him br br the fact that james <UNK> a little greedy by trying to shake down <UNK> for 2 million in <UNK> not only cost him his life but put david in danger of losing his as well <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> with david for the cd by getting his ex wife liz to talk to him about giving it up <UNK> made a deal to pay off her <UNK> if she comes through david is later killed by <UNK> mexican hit man tony with the help of a great white shark who just doesn't go for all this peaceful <UNK> on his <UNK> part br br tony had taken the cd that liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe and now <UNK> to murder james like he did david and at the same time keep the cd to have something over <UNK> br br david who had secretly hidden the <UNK> that james had on him at the time of his murder is now the target of tony and his men to shut him up for good david also wants to take the <UNK> and at the same time give his boss <UNK> the impression that the cd that david had is lost but use it later without <UNK> knowing who's behind it to blackmail him br br the movie night of the sharks has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one eyed white shark who ends up taking out about a half dozen of the cast members including tony david who's a firm believer in gun control uses knives high <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as his <UNK> to take out the entire tony crew even the killer shark is finished off by tony but with a hunting knife not a gun when it came to using <UNK> to save his friend and sidekick <UNK> a girlfriend <UNK> and his priest father <UNK> lives from tony and his gang guns were a no no with david he was more of a knife and <UNK> man then anything else br br the ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with david thought to be killed by the one eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd after <UNK> was convinced that he's dead and leaves the village david continues his life as a free living and loving <UNK> with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars <UNK> to david's credit he had his friend <UNK> give <UNK> back his cd but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin who <UNK> doesn't know who and where he is will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal <UNK>
<START> zero day is based of <UNK> high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you don't know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about <UNK> bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made br br the two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds <UNK> stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily <UNK> and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i'm not saying its right but many people do do things like that br br and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film br br so thats my review on zero day br br and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
<START> i first came across this film when i read a book written in the 1970s about the career of mitchell <UNK> i have to admit that over the years i have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality swing high swing low was supposed to be one of his best while it did not bore me it did not impress me as much as hold back the dawn death takes a holiday kitty or even golden <UNK> i suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked br br working at paramount <UNK> had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre it's true that twice standards appeared in his films but they were really rare cases <UNK> for two appeared in murder at the <UNK> and <UNK> lisa came out of captain carey u s a but the rest of the score for murder at the <UNK> was forgettable <UNK> lisa was the only tune in captain carey it shouldn't have been this way <UNK> studio had rogers and hart working for it in the early 1930s why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them the score for swing high swing low is pleasant but forgettable unfortunately the movie is centered in the entertainment world as fred macmurray demonstrates great talents as a <UNK> player he even works carole lombard into his act by <UNK> his arms around her when he blows his <UNK> the song sung by lombard about how her <UNK> playing thrills her is important to the plot it works in the film but it would have been better if the song was more memorable br br there is a <UNK> style to the film it begins on an ocean liner that lombard works on as a <UNK> she is constantly being <UNK> by her boss franklin <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> then the ship is entering into the <UNK> <UNK> and we see macmurray as a soldier who's <UNK> is ending shortly their first scene together has a nice <UNK> touch in it macmurray is talking to lombard she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit br br the film follows the rise and fall of the <UNK> johnson macmurray as he meets lombard and begins his reputation as a <UNK> player but meets the other woman in the film dorothy <UNK> the best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with lombard and his collapse as a jazz <UNK> his appearance and need for alcohol is very <UNK> for a macmurray character even his darker figures like walter <UNK> or mr <UNK> or the naval officer who pushes the caine <UNK> did not demonstrate a <UNK> on alcohol br br lombard is good as the woman loved but <UNK> by macmurray <UNK> has little to really do possibly the film had more scenes with her in it but one stands out is her attempt to get macmurray onto the <UNK> again in his opening bit <UNK> is fine rarely noticed in films small part actor carl <UNK> is effective as a fair weather fan friend of macmurray who drops him as he goes under though he gives him a hand out br br charles <UNK> is as trivial in this film as usual but he does have one moment when he looks <UNK> at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he his girlfriend macmurray and lombard share his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that macmurray is <UNK> is true it was a nice subtle moment if only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of <UNK> humor
<START> everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that br br seriously <UNK> this is a movie that is completely <UNK> an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send up with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the <UNK> message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip <UNK> will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a <UNK> adolescent <UNK> and no recognizable human emotion  just <UNK> <UNK> isn't a movie it's a panic attack avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build up such as <UNK>
<START> everyday we can watch a great number of film soap on tv sometimes a miracle happens a great film with real feelings with great actors with a great <UNK> director for me there are two films that everyone needs to see the first is the <UNK> sophie 's choice with meryl streep the second is journey of hope as human beings we need to learn about <UNK> about love of the others about <UNK> of other <UNK> other way of living we also have to struggle against racism and <UNK> we must avoid judging criticize we only have to love our earth companion this wonderful film helps us reaching john lennon his dream imagine all the people living live in peace these two films are difficult to see watch these but sure you will be hurt but better great film great actors terrible story pain and cry guarantee but also better understanding of the others enjoy it
<START> for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a <UNK> storyline this one is for you from the bleak new york city atmosphere which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality this movie is a real <UNK> br br why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral <UNK> abandoned wanted to celebrate that fact filmmakers then were like an immature six year old with an <UNK> expense account at the local candy store so hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape prostitution homosexuality child nudity homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing and then awarded its work br br it also hoped i'm sure to shock mainstream audiences well it succeeded on that level audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time couldn't help but <UNK> <UNK> upon this piece of <UNK> garbage br br forty years ago as a very young man i found this film fascinating too however seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again br br the acting was good but so what acting is good in many films nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldn't act hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing <UNK> out people he was kind of like the johnny <UNK> of his era playing guys like ratso rizzo in this film and then going to be the rain man later on yes ratso is a character you'll never forget and joe buck voight is one you want to forget but the story is so <UNK> it <UNK> the fine acting br br this movie isn't art and it isn't worthy of its many awards it only pushed the <UNK> big time in 1969 and that's why it is so <UNK> remembered in the hearts of film people and critics it's two hours of profanity and ultra sleazy religious cheap shots <UNK> <UNK> andy <UNK> even gets in the act no surprise and generally despicable people br br i did like the catchy song everybody's <UNK> that helped make harry <UNK> famous but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better before <UNK> did it and few people have ever heard of neil which is their loss and as mentioned the name ratso rizzo kind of stays with you br br the film is a landmark but in a negative sense i fear this marked it as official that hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has remained in the <UNK> ever since
<START> a <UNK> henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five dollar hooker in this extremely low budget horror comedy i can't explain all the positive comments on this movie i'll <UNK> it up to mass <UNK> but it's <UNK> none the less the one redeeming factor and this is me being extremely generous here might be the grandfather who's the only semi likable character in this whole mess don't waste your money or time in fact here's a word of advice if troma puts it out on dvd but does not make it themselves in all <UNK> it's crap br br troma dvd extras commentary with omar and kirk second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes <UNK> troma <UNK> radiation march clip from terror <UNK> theatrical trailer trailers for the <UNK> girls teenage <UNK> in heat <UNK> the musical and toxic <UNK> 4 br br my grade d
<START> wow i knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad <UNK> comments ensue br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> sweet retired cop cliche helping out everyone smiling like a post <UNK> <UNK> patient through out and <UNK> over his dead son his adopted son returns from armed forces special <UNK> and because he's seen things portrayed by <UNK> his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew <UNK> and his dead son who the bad <UNK> killed and his adopted son br br oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex army bloke this happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene br br the action could have saved this film but it's even worse than the storyline and acting it's all been done before it's all been done much much better <UNK> <UNK> is a prime example this is the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen <UNK> twice br br <UNK> the film is called honor <UNK> wrong for the americans and the tag line has from the makers of <UNK> and <UNK> check out director david <UNK> other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old such classics as shark attack 3 <UNK> says it all really br br i'll give you <UNK> if you don't go to see this film br br ps <UNK> for not know character names tells you something though
<START> i just blew four dollars renting this movie why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film i'm tired of our media <UNK> a film simply because it's canadian and low budget it's like they expect canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardless br br now about the movie the acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good the film quality was poor which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget the script was absolutely horrendous an example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who <UNK> with one of her <UNK> so that she can <UNK> him to fix and steal <UNK> for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy <UNK> supposedly many of her gang <UNK> <UNK> are destroyed in these activities i don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from <UNK> to toronto br br anyway the point of the story which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to <UNK> buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more <UNK> as no one will want to live in the area br br need i say more br br shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film <UNK> for supporting it and the globe and mail and georgia straight <UNK> for giving such biased reviews br br a film shouldn't get special treatment just because it's canadian
<START> if <UNK> exorcist ii the <UNK> did him no <UNK> it's hard to imagine what <UNK> <UNK> richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non thrills you've seen it all before burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move <UNK> objects through force of his mind and you thought carrie had no impact on hollywood though adapted from a novel by peter van <UNK> <UNK> plays like recycled goods though the special effects in the <UNK> finale are solid if typical lee <UNK> is somewhat present as a doctor but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak burton is hammy but weary not even <UNK> could save him at this point 1 2 from
<START> i first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001 and it really had a profound effect on me so much that i <UNK> several of my friends to see it with me on repeat <UNK> the bottom line none of my friends walked away disappointed ever this stellar film is about scottish <UNK> artist andy goldsworthy who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural <UNK> wood water flowers rocks etc to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form a statement in the temporary state of everything we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art as well as some of his long term <UNK> in major <UNK> around the world as well as a few pieces in the natural world as well german film maker thomas <UNK> directs photographs edits this <UNK> on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye ear with an <UNK> musical score composed performed by fred <UNK> who's music is generally edgy experimental noise <UNK> guitar as well as a capable ensemble of musicians although this film has been available on dvd for some years now if you can find a cinema that is <UNK> a revival of this fine film by all means seek it out it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen with a <UNK> sound system to truly experience this film the right way no mpaa rating but contains nothing to offend unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or <UNK>
<START> i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i'm not a huge fan of either <UNK> cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bit br br dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a <UNK> he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend br br this movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all top notch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with <UNK> <UNK> character we never really get a close look at the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what <UNK> inner conflict about being in love with <UNK> girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year
<START> if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of <UNK> do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about <UNK> and his life creating <UNK> <UNK> so brilliant and a very cool production the whole background story about <UNK> and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this i will for sure be in my basement digging up the <UNK> albums again also the movie itself are very well told and has a great <UNK> sound to it i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did
<START> there are only two movies i would give a 1 10 to this stinker and the man who fell to earth i remember seeing <UNK> at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school the script is insulting to anyone including a high school <UNK> intelligence it completely lost me with the <UNK> gag of someone getting shot in the butt goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic then there are offensive stereotypes about <UNK> followed by goldie winning over everyone by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the acting was terrible including goldie <UNK> i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst
<START> i'm glad the folks at imdb were able to <UNK> what genre this film falls into i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy but since it also seems to want to be a dark and <UNK> melodrama i wasn't sure for a comedy it is amazingly <UNK> of even the slightest venture into the <UNK> of humour right up until the ridiculous twist ending which <UNK> what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is it is hard to describe just how amateurish the <UNK> really is did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack <UNK> disbelief at how terrible it is
<START> i have wanted to see this for the longest time james <UNK> is a great director <UNK> punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire <UNK> this film was good but i expected more br br p s look for great cameos by <UNK> <UNK> and chris <UNK>
<START> after reading only two of the comments <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> fan beginning with <UNK> <UNK> and enduring with the many versions of <UNK> rochester it is more than eye opening to see that it is the <UNK> <UNK> sister who gave the lie to the male <UNK> period the trio inhabited of course the miracle in all three versions of 19th century british <UNK> is that the girls were all <UNK> and their only realistic <UNK> with men were their <UNK> father and their <UNK> brother that said finally it is anne <UNK> who has in her single <UNK> proved the feminist point way way ahead of contemporary types and including the voting franchise ranks however history <UNK> more than a few who <UNK> including the greek <UNK> and <UNK> and the likes of an ancient <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and how about eve and her apple
<START> i loved this movie it's truly bizarre extremely funny morbid witty it makes no sense to tell about the <UNK> of the movie because then i'd be giving out the outcome you have to see it without knowing what is it about everything is connected and has its why because it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they <UNK> in the most insane <UNK> you can imagine it's even more fun to watch the movie the second time once you know all the tricks the actors are excellent especially <UNK> <UNK> whose final scenes are a real master piece i highly recommend this film it's one of the most original ones i've ever seen
<START> by all the <UNK> people have been doing over miike and his work i sat through this flick tonight i figured if it's half as good as <UNK> as i assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my time br br no such luck br br i'm all for finding the next great director or writer but i don't think miike is the one i don't have an <UNK> masters of fine arts but i do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing it also has to give the viewer more <UNK> than this movie does br br this film's pacing had me shaking my head some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly i went to the <UNK> and <UNK> there while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the camera for seemingly minutes on end eyes wide and mouth <UNK> a famous director once made the claim and i'm <UNK> a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll <UNK> is not a good enough actress to make that work she stares <UNK> at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember and she isn't the only one doing an <UNK> of a deer in <UNK> other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non performance the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time br br i like asian cinema hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years korean horror like phone and <UNK> ang lee's work some of the trashy but fun <UNK> movies with gratuitous sex and fighting as well as others <UNK> <UNK> i could have done without
<START> i read that there's a girl in my soup came out during peter <UNK> low period watching the movie i'm not surprised almost nothing happens in the movie seemingly the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie it doesn't the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything maybe i haven't seen every movie about middle aged to elderly people trying to be hippies but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name br br all in all both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this so don't waste your time on this pretty worthless
<START> the <UNK> is a deep psychological <UNK> lightly <UNK> as a weird out superhero story julie winters is a <UNK> social worker in an <UNK> filthy city ridden with crime and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through the <UNK> is her friend and client a street bum who thinks he's a <UNK> superhero or is it the other way around br br the <UNK> is not to be missed for the artwork the story itself or the excellent voice work particularly the late barry <UNK> deliciously <UNK> <UNK> evil <UNK> of the main villain mr gone br br if you get the chance to see this don't miss it
<START> if you're in the mood for some dopey light entertainment this will pass the time if you expect one <UNK> of <UNK> don't bother to me the dance scene looked like it was exaggerated for comic effect it didn't look especially hot or skilled
<START> the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes although i don't mention it in great detail br br earth is an <UNK> 90 minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv the tv version was narrated by david attenborough a captivating <UNK> who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star <UNK> captain <UNK> there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that's may be appropriate in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it there are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to <UNK> 3 animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or <UNK> it is we see something of each kind of animal but only <UNK> and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of <UNK> mountains <UNK> <UNK> and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and <UNK> on earth you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or <UNK> or cities aren't in the film so it's a typical nature documentary but <UNK> shot and accompanied by delightful music when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me it is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit 6 in the <UNK> no blood is shed some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be <UNK> by kids it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took <UNK> and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty it had it's dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of 500 seats of which 15 were taken true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie some didn't but the most impressive shots big <UNK> did luckily it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film
<START> i was really surprised with this movie going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest i was expecting bad sex jokes and <UNK> and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work instead i got a smart surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sex br br yes the film is chock full <UNK> sex jokes and <UNK> and the occasional hey look a <UNK> but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than <UNK> boys all the characters are people you probably know in real life <UNK> friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives br br i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and i was very surprised <UNK> it's pretty over the top c'mon it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin but it's very <UNK> done br br in the end you're really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if <UNK> <UNK> found his car or not
<START> well i have finally caught up with rock <UNK> roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 <UNK> that i am i will probably first see this <UNK> new documentary <UNK> smith dream of life sometime around <UNK> and no the film doesn't feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait this is a very high energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments it tells the story of riff <UNK> <UNK> played by p j soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince <UNK> high <UNK> against their new <UNK> principal miss <UNK> danny <UNK> in his book cult movies quite accurately describes mary <UNK> performance as an evil eve <UNK> a typical teens vs establishment story line is <UNK> up here with some <UNK> humor those exploding mice that giant mouse the <UNK> and <UNK> hall <UNK> and some truly rousing tunes riff is of course the 1 fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band <UNK> out a <UNK> dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast indeed the sight of riff <UNK> dancing to teenage <UNK> at this <UNK> may be the <UNK> funniest moment and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and <UNK> in their <UNK> and later <UNK> down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite <UNK> the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kid's wet dream fun stuff indeed on a side note the ramones were one of the <UNK> bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with <UNK> english subtitles for the hearing <UNK> how many aging <UNK> out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder
<START> the <UNK> is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot in four <UNK> we follow a north american family with 3 members but we don't only see them we also follow the story of several characters as a black <UNK> an <UNK> student leader and a soldier in vietnam the filmography is just extraordinary in the first chapters we see some shots of the vietnam war in between the scenes the next chapter doesn't start where the last one finished it starts some time after giving us a little mystery on what happened in general the <UNK> mini series is a must see not only for hippies fanatics but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic
<START> many days after seeing <UNK> <UNK> i am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film br br no one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about <UNK> <UNK> her colleagues or the product of her <UNK> br br likewise no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained br br as a sci fi film this would <UNK> be a horrendous failure somehow the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer with the advice and <UNK> words of timothy <UNK> i doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd br br as a drama film this would <UNK> be a horrendous failure somehow the writer director manages to fill <UNK> five minutes with constant unnecessary annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing i doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction br br i find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for <UNK> <UNK> the circumstances under which i saw it <UNK> me from leaving the theater but there is no question that i would have otherwise i am still angry that i wasted the time that it took to see it only that i might more effectively criticize this movie i wish that i were more <UNK>
<START> you play as b j <UNK> a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to <UNK> nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii that means everything from breaking out of a nazi <UNK> to <UNK> hitler's war machine and even the <UNK> himself br br this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time that's because it literally inspired obsession many games existed at the time and even more do today but every so often you get a real <UNK> this is one of them just like <UNK> before it and more recently <UNK> iii in 2002 yes doom is better in almost every respect but the shots heard around the world which led to one of <UNK> biggest <UNK> waves were fired by b j <UNK> the space marine duke <UNK> max payne serious sam john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> agent <UNK> gordon freeman and <UNK> of others owe their existence to the guys at id whether directly or in most cases <UNK> but they still do br br even with its old look very aged graphics super simple <UNK> this is really a game games now border on the experience level and highly <UNK> levels the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a <UNK> in them br br also halt bang bang bang <UNK> never grows old 8 10 br br <UNK> rated pc 13 for profound carnage however it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today
<START> in the spirit of the classic the <UNK> this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a <UNK> proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> the vulnerable doctor falls for the career <UNK> and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it's climax and ending are stunning you'll especially enjoy how the doctor <UNK> herself
<START> carmen is one of the best films i've ever seen it's hard to say whose performance is best antonio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and laura del <UNK> are superb they dance their souls out it's a beautiful tale of <UNK> of life and myth myth <UNK> everyday life dance becomes life and entire life is <UNK> out real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else act out the parts of lovers of old the magic is continuing
<START> well <UNK> is without doubt the best british television show ever the performances the directing the casting the suspense the drama everything is fantastic about it br br although the show fell a little later in its final season this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and <UNK> a superb story for fans of the show and <UNK> i cannot recommend this movie more find it and watch it but i do advise watching the series first as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie br br an obvious 10 10
<START> the <UNK> elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british <UNK> current day <UNK> <UNK> upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william <UNK> who also directed the life of <UNK> <UNK> and portrait of <UNK> does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie <UNK> to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
<START> i thought that ice age was an excellent movie as a woman of 30 with no children i still seem to really enjoy these humorous witty animated movies sid is the best character i have seen in some time better than <UNK> in <UNK> although he was really humorous and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten and even more humorous than <UNK> in <UNK> i have seen the movie at least 15 times i own it obviously and i quote the movie at work on many occasions yes still my favourite scene is the part where sid says oh oh oh i love this game and sid and <UNK> continue to figure out what the <UNK> is trying to tell them about the <UNK> pack of wolves pack of bears pack of <UNK> pack of <UNK> pack of <UNK> pack a <UNK> pack of lies pack of troubles pack a <UNK> pack of birds pack of flying fish or however that part goes that is the funniest part about the whole movie although i also really enjoyed the humour behind putting <UNK> on the map and many other parts as well the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is brother bear
<START> honestly where can i begin this was a low budget horribly acted film it was so cheesy it had us all <UNK> with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just <UNK> to try and make it look like they were struggling me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was the <UNK> island movie i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene br br oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etc was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it but if you happen to stumble upon this movie do not get it
<START> i didn't expect to like this film as much as i did i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time it didn't look particularly great i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory br br it's about a twenty year old woman wants to know everything she stores every bit of information she <UNK> in an enormous archive she experiments with experience in sex political <UNK> and human relationships meanwhile film's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other nudity explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its <UNK> by customs was <UNK> the film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind the scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative the fourth wall being broken this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen the movie <UNK> works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goings on freedom fighting and sexual <UNK> i like to think of it as much more than that br br i didn't think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do this film is a buried treasure give it a try
<START> i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing its drama and action packed episodes were thrilling the <UNK> character was well drawn and admirable overall the photography script and direction was perfectly <UNK> rather than taking the film to be a <UNK> piece of propaganda as some might i enjoyed it as a well <UNK> portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime again the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his arguably important work i did not find to be a <UNK> representation but an ideal and <UNK> one
<START> the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is <UNK> over a moving star field oh and a <UNK> appears as well for some reason he says for it's written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood and i saw her <UNK> upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden <UNK> full of the <UNK> <UNK> and upon her <UNK> was written behold i am the great mother of an <UNK> word i couldn't make out no matter how many times i <UNK> the tape and tried to sorry and all <UNK> of the earth this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre after the opening credits which are set over shots of <UNK> architecture we get an on screen <UNK> that informs us we're in <UNK> angeles california u s a city of the <UNK> i knew i was in for a long <UNK> minutes it's probably not too long after the events of the original howling 1981 and it's karen <UNK> funeral after the ceremony <UNK> brother ben <UNK> brown is spoken to by an <UNK> <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> christopher lee who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life ben <UNK> such nonsense but together with one of <UNK> friends and colleagues jenny annie <UNK> he visits <UNK> at his home there <UNK> tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is the queen of werewolves <UNK> also shows them a photograph taken at <UNK> funeral of a woman named <UNK> <UNK> a hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen <UNK> says he will stake any <UNK> through the heart with <UNK> ben figures out that <UNK> means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop <UNK> however lots of werewolves turn up and attack <UNK> ben and jenny they survive the attack and manage to find out that <UNK> is to be found in <UNK> they all decide to travel to <UNK> and stop <UNK> and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse once there they travel to a small town called <UNK> which means <UNK> wolves <UNK> and meet up with the local priest father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters hey what else can i call them oh and a dwarf named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> helps too they follow <UNK> who they hope will lead them to <UNK> but <UNK> knows of <UNK> arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny will <UNK> be able to put an end to <UNK> plans for world <UNK> will this film get any more bizarre or surreal watch it and find out directed by <UNK> <UNK> this is one strange mess of a film it's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around <UNK> the single biggest problem is the script by robert <UNK> and gary <UNK> based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy <UNK> films this is right up there with the best of them there are werewolf <UNK> which are just freaky to watch we get some cool werewolf killing <UNK> the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don't know if this was actually shot in <UNK> but it doesn't look like what i thought mid 80's <UNK> would <UNK> castle is part <UNK> part gothic castle and part modern luxury house <UNK> and her <UNK> costumes are very over the top <UNK> wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her <UNK> wear skimpy leather clothing too the special make up effects range from good to poor a <UNK> eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf <UNK> and attacks there is plenty of nudity as well as <UNK> and her <UNK> are a real randy bunch of werewolves i should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film i wonder what he thinks of it basically the whole thing is a real mess but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of <UNK> <UNK> taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times if that's your thing
<START> the united states of kiss my <UNK> br br house of games is the <UNK> debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller it stars lindsay <UNK> as best selling psychiatrist margaret ford who decides to confront the <UNK> who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels <UNK> to visit the <UNK> place house of games br br the <UNK> mike played excellently by joe <UNK> turns out to be somewhat sharp and <UNK> he offers <UNK> character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the <UNK> he'll <UNK> the patients <UNK> the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the <UNK> are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the con man or is it the well known man of great <UNK> david mamet br br in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads <UNK> and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of <UNK> work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become <UNK> and war of words everyone <UNK> and double <UNK> which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension house of games can also be viewed as a class <UNK> division movie with lindsay <UNK> we have the middle class well to do educated psychiatrist and joe <UNK> is the complete opposite the working class of america <UNK> a living by <UNK> crime br br the film <UNK> the viewer much like <UNK> is <UNK> by <UNK> and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for it's stunning br br an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings 9 10
