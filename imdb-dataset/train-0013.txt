<START> spoiler warning there are some minor spoilers in this review don't read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film br br the disney channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel most of these are mediocre and drab having a few good elements but still being a disappointment phantom of the <UNK> ' <UNK> from planet weird ' <UNK> girl of the 21st <UNK> every once in a great while they make something really really great genius ' the other <UNK> but once in a while the disney channel makes a huge mistake and gives us a real stinker this month december 2000 the disney channel featured the ultimate christmas present ' which i thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting apparently the <UNK> <UNK> was rushed out a few days before christmas to get a jump on the holiday because the plot has to do with toys they even paid for a feature in the tv guide so i thought it must be better than the norm i was in for a complete shock only disney's model <UNK> has been worse than this br br the plot was more far fetched than normal i usually let that slide but here it just goes too far matthew tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work his father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large <UNK> at a <UNK> bank to stay <UNK> time and time again his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home he gets a hair <UNK> idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to <UNK> in a computer chip that his sister is <UNK> that whole concept is full of <UNK> when kids send in millions of dollars matthew opens his own <UNK> bank account and buys up most of his <UNK> <UNK> stock he is the secret boss but he doesn't reveal this to his dad but instead presents himself at board <UNK> as a cartoon image through a computer that image itself is so complex and ridiculous that it isn't possible for someone to create it at home much less someone who comes across as stupid as matthew to make a long plot short matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids but a federal agent shows up <UNK> about <UNK> company as it is <UNK> br br there's so much wrong here as mentioned the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses which these kids are not the website the cartoon image the computer chip even the stuff they are being taught in school are far too advanced for these kids the acting by most of the cast especially kevin <UNK> is terrible some familiar faces are wasted dom <UNK> plays the evil bank owner but his part is a throwaway he has one good scene with alexandra paul who shows she has the ability to act in which he explains his motives but nothing more and rich little is wasted in a small role as a judge there's even some offensive and <UNK> for anti russian jokes but the greatest atrocities are the hard <UNK> themes these themes show up in many of the disney <UNK> films but never before have these ultra conservative messages been <UNK> so strongly the typical <UNK> <UNK> idea is really pushed hard and after delivering it <UNK> in the ultimate christmas present ' seeing it again <UNK> my mood family relations are important but disney must stop this endless preaching because working is important to maintaining a <UNK> family too except for <UNK> activities thanks to work the father didn't come across as that bad but i found it offensive when the grandmother told him i don't like what i see ' just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents must marry if they want to raise their kids right enter alexandra paul whose character while important to the plot is there solely to be the love interest for the father this <UNK> only proves that the disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid <UNK> from the bottom of the disney script barrel instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud wait for the next disney channel movie it has to be better than this <UNK> score 1 out of 10
<START> perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films <UNK> does not fall into any of the traps <UNK> associated with bollywood film ie <UNK> farce <UNK> and <UNK> imitation of western film themes genres <UNK> is <UNK> to the sub continent and authentic almost <UNK> <UNK> like in plot characters are well developed direction although sometimes <UNK> by today's standards <UNK> and convincing the <UNK> speaking <UNK> at the time of <UNK> were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age the acting particularly the <UNK> and the dynamic between characters are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not <UNK> with the <UNK> and customs of muslim india br br coupled with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score enhanced by the protagonist displaying <UNK> command of classical indian dance <UNK> as is the case with most romantic <UNK> the heroine must die but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience <UNK> is surely the <UNK> of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be <UNK>
<START> i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to <UNK> at guess i was <UNK> to this movie is very boring br br the movie starts out <UNK> raines <UNK> <UNK> sitting outside a <UNK> <UNK> checking to see if they have the right car when they confirm it's the right one <UNK> gets a brick out of the <UNK> and <UNK> it at the window shattering it he gets the <UNK> while his friend gets the keys they start up the car and take off into the night they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police so the whole crew <UNK> all the cars and go their separate ways then we get a glimpse of <UNK> raines he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go <UNK> track then he is confronted by <UNK> jackson will <UNK> <UNK> tells <UNK> that his brother <UNK> is in deep <UNK> <UNK> is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles <UNK> heads to a <UNK> and meets raymond <UNK> christopher <UNK> this guy threatens to kill <UNK> if <UNK> doesn't deliver 50 cars within <UNK> hours br br there are a few problems with this film br br 1 story the first 48 in movie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out the last 12 in movie hours are a waste br br 2 the cars you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie <UNK> so where are the other 40 cars why don't we get to see them br br 3 the chase the chase at the end of the movie was a joke it was not suspenseful at all br br 4 the dog somewhere in the movie the dog eats the <UNK> and <UNK> three keys as well this is impossible the keys were <UNK> open the keys would have severely damaged the <UNK> <UNK> stomach and large intestines the guys suggest giving the dog <UNK> to help him <UNK> it out this won't work the dog will get a lot of <UNK> but no keys it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his <UNK> take <UNK> lots of <UNK> but no car same case with the dog br br 5 the cop during the chase when <UNK> breaks down for a few minutes nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car you see a police <UNK> behind him who isn't looking at his car at all but right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again the police officer <UNK> his head to the right sees the car and immediately begins to chase after him it is stupid so right when he heard the engine start and saw the car he knew that was the car he was looking for how does he know it's the right car he only sees the back of it br br overall the movie is boring there is no action there are very few cars the movie is stupid i have never seen the original but i plan to br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 get the fast and furious instead
<START> i almost burst into tears watching this movie not from laughing but from the memories of a great rodney <UNK> movie <UNK> was his first and stole the movie easy money had him at his best and back to school is by far an 80's classic masterpiece then there was <UNK> and that's when it started to show poor rodney was getting old meet <UNK> sparks was a slight step up from <UNK> but not saying much br br in my 5 wives rodney plays <UNK> a name he must love since that was his name in easy money a rich <UNK> he always guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing well now he <UNK> a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the <UNK> he <UNK> 5 wives this sounds like a great idea for a <UNK> movie the problem is everything the script is so poor that rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not rodney andrew <UNK> clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the f word which he should since the film is rated r but plays as if it was pg and jerry stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo don't get me wrong at times i did laugh at a few of <UNK> jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow we can see his jokes coming from miles and the film turns way too pc which thanks to the horrible 1990's the 70's and 80's rodney just doesn't work anymore
<START> when i saw this trailer on tv i was surprised in may of 2008 i was at six <UNK> in new jersey and this was showing at a 4 d attraction you know the attraction that the seats move i take it that the version i saw was a <UNK> version 15 min and also re created to add the motion effects it was a cute movie but that was it it was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a cgi <UNK> seemed a bit well trite i was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first <UNK> i will say the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute so all in all i would say if you want to bring the younger kids go for it but if you are wanting to take your older kids take them to another movie they will thank you
<START> the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense what a waste of 2 perfectly good hours if you can explain it to me please do i don't usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either i'm slower than i think or this was a really bad movie
<START> br br attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs the very <UNK> story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly basically they spin and <UNK> yes they <UNK> and the next thing you know the person is covered in <UNK> the actors are no names who never made movies after this so there would be no point to name them there's a guy who's hired by the <UNK> to try and stop the menace of tomatoes he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who <UNK> anyway there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government if this isn't making much sense to you you understand this movie never would have been very good in the first place but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes the movie is horribly <UNK> which although being the whole point really really hurts what could've been a reasonably entertaining movie at one point a giant wax <UNK> <UNK> on an <UNK> <UNK> of wood with <UNK> on it maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value but even this is lacking from this terrible movie 2 10
<START> paulie is a fantasy of a <UNK> girl or perhaps her <UNK> of what her youth was like growing up br br tony <UNK> <UNK> a flawless performance as an russian scientist <UNK> who cannot find decent work in america he befriends an isolated parrot while performing <UNK> duties of a janitor at a <UNK> science lab br br the chief doctor is a bitter man as paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn <UNK> the doctor who later <UNK> him to the lower levels of the building where <UNK> tony s finds him br br paulie <UNK> his life with marie and how they lost each other the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie only more than 20 years has passed br br the movie ends some will say predictably with <UNK> <UNK> paulie with marie the story <UNK> with the three entering <UNK> home where you can make the final your own choice br br great family film
<START> this is a well made documentary on the exciting world of <UNK> car racing the photography is simply outstanding the scene were mario <UNK> drives the old racing <UNK> down the new england street <UNK> with the ancient <UNK> leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car is incredible the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film
<START> this is the weakest of the series not much of a plot and a rather odd looking wallace but it's still pretty good considering a sign of greater things to come br br 6 10
<START> this is what happens when you're living in china and the local video store is running thin on english language <UNK> are blessed with this work of what appears to be yes romanian cinema nevertheless i think that it has real comedic potential br br spoilers technically follow br br though i don't think that it would in fact spoil anyone's viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach <UNK> even in flashback that mystery and many other <UNK> remain to be exploited by desperate comedians perhaps when they're stuck in <UNK> br br let me also wonder <UNK> why perfectly good looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this it's sad
<START> the filming crew did not have good access to the occupied <UNK> so filming of the israeli side dominated i was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers the israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness the palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of <UNK> and despair with such completely different <UNK> any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds the word peace did not have the same meaning to each of them peace to the palestinian was freedom peace to the israeli was security with such an <UNK> is this sort of film really worth much i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda both sides were unconvincing
<START> this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in <UNK> the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors <UNK> in the cast are <UNK> as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and <UNK> as a casino dealer who <UNK> as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work well together this is an impressive feature film debut for writer <UNK> and director <UNK> the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a marvelous little comedy drama
<START> he only gets third billing behind arthur <UNK> virginia field but this was effectively david <UNK> first starring role and he's <UNK> silly as p g <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> master in name only to <UNK> that most <UNK> of <UNK> as an adaptation it's more like a watered down the <UNK> steps than a true <UNK> outing and that's too bad since the interplay between <UNK> niven isn't too far off the mark alas the <UNK> movie mystery <UNK> forced comedy grow <UNK> even at a brief <UNK> minutes next year's follow up step lively <UNK> was even more off the mark with no <UNK> in sight and <UNK> of all people forced to play the goof
<START> a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword i've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don't think i can ever watch a another movie again may god pity the souls who made this br br premise ex army quiet stud underwear model type character well acted actually goes looking for the girl who sent him a <UNK> card while serving in the military lands in with her cabin living <UNK> type family who are right wing <UNK> family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see he's a better catch than her liberal looking french wine drinking <UNK> driving loud cell phone talking lazy city <UNK> jewish looking fiancé br br the bad <UNK> characters <UNK> themes being beat over the head with the pro military theme ed <UNK> br br the good commercial breaks were long peter jason it ended
<START> this is one of the <UNK> scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie ever br br dr <UNK> louise and his family moving in to new home with his wife rachel daughter <UNK> and little son gage everything seems normal until dr <UNK> loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet <UNK> and show him that where the dead come to life br br louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to <UNK> who worried about her cat that could be killed by <UNK> and then later on rachel tells louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister <UNK> who was really sick as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most <UNK> scene ever br br the next day louis gets a call from jed saying there cat as been killed by <UNK> and jed take him to place where victor the ghost told him not to go and bury the cat his wife and kids have go to see their grandparents and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see jed then jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too as we seen other flashback br br later on in the movie the family out having <UNK> gage is playing with <UNK> and gage <UNK> i drop it the wind blow the rod near the road where a <UNK> coming at fast past gage is get closer to road louis is <UNK> to get him the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or <UNK> will go down your back when you hear louis screams soon he missing him so much louis then <UNK> gage in same place where is buried the cat br br the scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life br br this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great 10 out 10
<START> i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack so here goes br br atrocious i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the <UNK> time it's really really painful but it was next on the list you can see that there is a tiny <UNK> of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is hobgoblins but it just couldn't get out everything about this movie is 4th rate the story the acting the effects the women the action scenes the <UNK> forget it i can watch a piece of crap like the <UNK> of dr z aka <UNK> over and over and over with hardly any ill effects i like it in fact btw it will be on tcm later this month october 2009 but hobgoblins is a whole <UNK> <UNK> br br the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended i had a good <UNK> sleep some coffee and some dry <UNK> my <UNK> and yet the <UNK> new wave dance music that amy red shorts and <UNK> newman were <UNK> to in the living room is still running through my head this torment will last for days br br good luck won't you
<START> i have nothing against a fast paced fright flick but this stephen king derived nonsense is too <UNK> <UNK> too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a <UNK> sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf and who <UNK> on the blood of female <UNK> begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an <UNK> colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice <UNK> as the boy's mother <UNK> from ghost story never broke out of the filler female mold and it's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that <UNK> <UNK> been a much better film with a different focus and <UNK> direction it's too over the top and <UNK> driven with an uneven tone that <UNK> wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do real life directors john <UNK> and tobe hooper 1 2 from
<START> <UNK> to <UNK> comes from latin <UNK> <UNK> to play so you're warned about the <UNK> <UNK> as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent activity <UNK> from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history whatever it may be and yet i feel fascinated by the <UNK> of <UNK> and loyalty the raw material of any relationship from the personal to the social after many years ago i was able to finish the book it was a revelation at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing i really started to love le <UNK> after that novel the main character is not <UNK> at all he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love or is he not after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of <UNK> <UNK> man in <UNK> wrote by <UNK> with 'the <UNK> of <UNK> there is no game left there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way or both there is no <UNK> here to <UNK> decent human qualities in 'the <UNK> or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case the bbc has done a superb work with these series from <UNK> novels the actors are excellent as are the locations and sets of course the script here is brilliantly adapted be warned though even if someone may find it laughable the after taste is bitter
<START> thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever seen br br i can't even think of a close second and i've seen some really bad movies br br absolutely nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i've seen better on youtube here's some typical dialogue br br steve steve steve is that you steve i'm not kidding steve this isn't funny steve are you there steve steve steve br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> when the magic of <UNK> opened at radio city music hall i was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart warming as some of the first <UNK> films were not br br the story was abysmal the songs by the <UNK> brothers were way below their usual level the characters were uninspired and james stewart and mickey rooney had both seen much better days br br then too i was interested in seeing what alice <UNK> contribution would be like since she'd been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so <UNK> in her earlier roles at fox alice too was letdown by the foolish script and the <UNK> photography another disappointment br br nothing original here nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy and clearly no magic present for anyone you can skip this one without missing a thing
<START> i like end of days movies i like b movies i was hoping i would like this movie br br i could ignore the poor effects the often atrocious music the cringe inducing lines i could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the movie constantly relies on <UNK> ex <UNK> is <UNK> given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the people who fight <UNK> and try to reach world peace are the bad guys none of these things kill the movie what kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie <UNK> morals on the viewers at the cost of actually having a coherent story or any kind of suspense br br if you're looking for an entertaining b movie look elsewhere this movie is just boring
<START> first of all jon bon <UNK> doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable if you keep that in mind and you're a total vampire movie fan you can have some fun with a few of the scenes don't expect any tarantino style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow
<START> horrible people ought to be the <UNK> of this horrible film if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things then look out of your window at real life but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things you'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh the characters talk at length but never actually manage to communicate with each other why not presumably because leigh things that all of us are as <UNK> and pathetic as his actors and he wants to film real life but we're not and he failed
<START> oliver twist was to have controversy as well as success following it after dickens published it in <UNK> his picture of life in the urban <UNK> was something shocking and new and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another <UNK> br br one day he was walking in london and passed a young woman he had been friendly with he said hello but she was rather stiff with him he could not understand this a few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to upset her well if you must know i did not like your last novel she said really everyone else thinks highly of it he was puzzled what's wrong with it oh charles she said i'm jewish how could you make up such a character like fagin he had not expected this well you know that trial last year of <UNK> <UNK> the thief <UNK> he's a model for fagin and he was jewish br br dickens found that did not settle things yes she <UNK> he got what he deserved but charles they did not call him <UNK> the jew like you call fagin the jew moreover <UNK> did not plan a murder fagin does dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away he left thinking about what she said br br oliver twist was published in several <UNK> dickens tried to improve on fagin a bit then he got an idea he <UNK> the chapter called <UNK> last night alive showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging he also added some additional details br br he let his female friend know about his resolve to change fagin a day or so later he met her at a friend's house she looked at him as though he was crazy didn't you like the changes he asked charles what changes he's still a vile villain called the jew she <UNK> yes i did keep those in but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison the young woman had noticed this but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears ah then i was right about that and did you see the little details i added he asked what details she <UNK> when you first see fagin now he is cooking himself dinner you read that dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition instead the lady looked confused i read he was at the <UNK> but i must have <UNK> the passage dickens <UNK> as though he was brilliant he is cooking a <UNK> <UNK> for his dinner a what she <UNK> he's eating <UNK> my dear see he's not a good jew his friend looked at him <UNK> her head and to his <UNK> left their friend's house she didn't speak to him for years br br dickens never totally <UNK> off his own <UNK> but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at <UNK> in his last completed novel in our mutual friend <UNK> he has a minor character mr <UNK> who is used by an <UNK> <UNK> to collect high <UNK> from poor <UNK> the <UNK> figures that mr <UNK> will be blamed because he is jewish br br but mr <UNK> is a good man he is a very good man he is a very very very very good man so good as to be unbelievable if fagin saw mr <UNK> in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick br br the anti <UNK> image of fagin <UNK> to this day it is a measure of <UNK> genius as a writer that the novel <UNK> it however in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors how after the holocaust can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without <UNK> <UNK> david lean showed how by having alec <UNK> appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity sir carol reed in his musical version of the novel did it better yet due to a rewrite in the original <UNK> script br br oliver had been made into a west end musical hit in the middle 1960s and then taken to broadway where it was again a hit with a wonderful score by lionel bart including food glorious food i am reviewing the situation consider yourself boy for sale who will buy as long as he needs me it deserved it's success reed did well in his casting the roles including his nephew oliver reed as sykes ron moody as fagin mark lester as oliver jack wild as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as nancy and harry <UNK> as mr <UNK> there had been no big musical <UNK> in hollywood for a decade the last musical to win the best picture oscar had been <UNK> in 1958 oliver won it in 1968 br br and fagin how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature well in the musical fagin is not captured tried and executed for the murder that is committed after all even lean showed fagin tried to control his <UNK> in his actions but here fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of <UNK> life although he loses his <UNK> those stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty he decides he can <UNK> he is allowed to do so accompanied by his faithful <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> i don't think dickens would have appreciated the change his female friend might have but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting
<START> my dog recently passed away and this was a movie i loved as a kid so i had to see it to try to cheer up br br beware of dog i mean spoilers this movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary it was set in new orleans in 1939 first and foremost the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with br br in the beginning charlie is not too different from his <UNK> and brutal business partner carface he is money driven greedy and just escaped death row as he states in the start of the feature the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others anne marie and his sidekick itchy carface will not even listen to the fat ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him br br carface attempts to murder the hero because he wants 100 of the <UNK> in their business and won't settle for only 50 a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die also being eaten by a <UNK> sized alligator who ends up <UNK> your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not this is a cartoon and that's why it is logical here br br <UNK> method of revenge is through murder while charlie believes success is the best revenge financial success that is after surviving death he starts a business by taking <UNK> source of <UNK> a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals they win a whole bunch of races and charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor hint hint charlie and itchy live in a <UNK> and are therefore poor he uses the money toward his casino bar theatre and not the other poor the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she <UNK> carefully she teaches charlie <UNK> by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses she added the <UNK> that his business needed while charlie did management and itchy provided construction br br carface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlie's business which is <UNK> by the government charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl in the end he had to choose between her life and his own he first grabs the watch out of self <UNK> and sets it down when the girl started to sink both the girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one and he chose the girl br br the great part about this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn right from wrong over time and a child's ability to cope with the natural <UNK> of death of their pet is that it never shows anyone dying the watch <UNK> his life and the watch is shown being <UNK> and stopped all the deaths were suggestive even for the villain i didn't cry during this movie until now and i have gotten so much more out of it that i had to write it down and share it with you
<START> this is one of three 80's movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was <UNK> directed by victor <UNK> a movie horribly overlook due to <UNK> legal sexual problems another would be <UNK> closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated not great but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean 10 years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the <UNK>
<START> sorry for my <UNK> language i am no native <UNK> br br yes this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction personally i agree upon all those <UNK> that are around but i won't use this rather <UNK> void way myself to describe the movie here because those perfect the one and only best ever reviews make some people turn away including me br br so if you are looking for another <UNK> that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones then don't miss this one if you happen to find it anywhere unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it it seems there is no dvd out there and the german language version which is quite well done is not available in any format br br just in case you decide to get a copy spare out that cut down two hours or so version of this movie it is no use and no fun and gives a wrong impression of a movie that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture and its also crippled down to 4 3 aspect ratio br br <UNK> from germany f l
<START> a truly nice story with a moral about <UNK> love describes this odd david lynch film this was especially odd because it wasn't the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years those were dark and shocking films blue <UNK> wild at heart <UNK> drive and this is the opposite i know it disappointed a lot of his fans others were delighted by it count me as one of the latter and i own all three of those dark films too br br this was another supposed true life story here <UNK> an elderly man's trip in a <UNK> <UNK> from western <UNK> all the way to <UNK> to see his <UNK> brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies well i guess that premise an old man driving a lawn <UNK> 400 miles still makes this an odd film of sorts so lynch stays in character with that br br richard farnsworth plays the title role he is the type of guy face wise voice wise low key personality wise that just about everyone likes the <UNK> on his face tell many a story it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released br br the first 25 minutes of this film isn't much and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally challenged child sissy <UNK> and her tragic past but once alvin straight farnsworth begins his trip the story picks up i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up but i am more generous with it i think it's a hidden gem to them it was a sleeping <UNK> br br i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story it is slow and if that's okay with you you might like this charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way such as a <UNK> young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble henry <UNK> as daniel <UNK> is a standout in that regard harry dean <UNK> gets third billing but that's a joke he's only in the final few minutes of the movie br br the <UNK> scenery is pleasant i lived there for several years and can <UNK> to the rolling hills and the rich <UNK> it's a nice state with nice people like this movie
<START> after some internet surfing i found the <UNK> series on dvd at <UNK> com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over <UNK> for the <UNK> into the abc news program <UNK> complete with the top news <UNK> from the early 1990's even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show's credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff <UNK> is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s <UNK> with vintage <UNK> and <UNK> the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a <UNK> either curiously the first episode of the show <UNK> begins in 1945 after the war had ended that's like shooting the first episode of <UNK> island showing the <UNK> being rescued the whole premise of the show's <UNK> is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run <UNK> near <UNK> however the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson <UNK> than <UNK> part of the ensemble cast are dick williams <UNK> winston and sterling <UNK> jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being <UNK> against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we're also tired of having our <UNK> <UNK> in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also <UNK> with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for <UNK> the acting talents of williams winston and <UNK> were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in <UNK> was a <UNK> member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a <UNK> gets a well deserved <UNK> and leave it at that <UNK> a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken <UNK> is portrayed as an <UNK> scrooge like character who is against <UNK> and raises and is <UNK> about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the <UNK> in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the <UNK> of food and gas <UNK> and working 14 hour days at war <UNK> of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or <UNK> <UNK> passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of <UNK> david <UNK> and james <UNK> completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and <UNK> into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to <UNK> the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
<START> i don't think i've ever been so <UNK> over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then <UNK> there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half formed story lines the characters weren't well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every <UNK> of this film is terrible and i'm just here to warn you all of that
<START> <UNK> is quite a painful and <UNK> melodrama set in jersey the story of a young mother who is out of jail on <UNK> after a drugs related conviction and fights to stay clean to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie <UNK> an actress at the top of her career who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders this is not enough however as the story line is too simplistic and expected and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script writer wanted or about the innocent kid who is in the middle even maggie <UNK> acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid
<START> this is a great story and was just the beginning of <UNK> in the united states we are still working on it too however despite the fact this is true it's still a movie and this is a movie site i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors but wow the only one even mediocre is the excellent <UNK> davis but even he couldn't make up for all the actors including the one playing him as a young man absolutely atrocious acting granted the script was terribly cliché but even then you have got to get some decent actors i wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category read some books about the true story of the u s s mason because they give these men the respect they deserve
<START> perfect cast for a few person drama simon is dead but somehow <UNK> from outside what he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots <UNK> to a magnificent score by german avant garde composer <UNK> <UNK> simon is haunted by his death <UNK> by support of death people he'd seen on the other side his girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to decides to follow him after his finally occurring death very <UNK> and moving deeply psychological but a bit slow and somewhere even boring
<START> i felt this film throughout i <UNK> impressed with russell <UNK> talent in developing his relationship with <UNK> such a typical aussie blend of <UNK> <UNK> approach a bit self <UNK> and very <UNK> really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive br br gosh didn't <UNK> talent even in 1993 shine and i have yet to see gladiator
<START> well i said it all in the summary i <UNK> adore the movie and the cast i would give each actor an oscar great great movie i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do about 2 or 3 times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy <UNK> also just brilliant i wish the movie received more awards i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and <UNK> loved each other so much and how <UNK> was close to her parents
<START> like many people on this site i saw this movie only once when it was first <UNK> in 1971 certain scenes <UNK> in my memory and an overall feeling of <UNK> is how i remember being affected by it i would be fascinated to see it again if it was ever made available for home video br br possible spoiler i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 british movie originally titled city of the dead <UNK> horror hotel for the american release there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man br br one detail remains with me years after seeing the film it's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film as i recall a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road circa <UNK> somewhere out west the friendly seeming ray <UNK> introduces himself and his daughter <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful young mute woman while the preacher is helping ray <UNK> with the <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> into view and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by any of the characters except <UNK> <UNK> she doesn't look scared at all but stares at the snake with silent concentration until it goes away with this strange little moment we already realize there's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time br br that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years along with many others the film has a haunting quality about it that won't let go and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly someone ought to make this available for home video
<START> dead to rights is about a police officer named jack <UNK> who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father br br several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and <UNK> the city for the man who framed him for murder jack's search leads him through a trail of <UNK> that doesn't end until everyone is dead br br through out the game jack uses weapons from <UNK> <UNK> to his dog shadow to kill endless <UNK> of people in 15 levels the game play is basically kill 30 people find switch to open door kill 50 people find switch to open door over and over until the level is done there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract <UNK> at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club or bomb <UNK> br br dead to rights is also a hard game you will be put in an area <UNK> with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck br br dead to rights is as gory as it is hard if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls ceiling and floor and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood br br family fun for everyone
<START> this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldn't explain the blood and gore the only good part they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but don't say i didn't warn you two things how could <UNK> say welcome when he didn't have a tongue its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role second thing that <UNK> me why were we shown <UNK> jones' <UNK> and him cutting them off and putting them into blue <UNK> then these have no further role why not i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldn't waste my time wish i'd have watched mirrors instead
<START> if derivative and predictable rape revenge thrillers are your thing then you're in for a rare treat they don't really appeal to me so i couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale it seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video gillian anderson and danny <UNK> do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady <UNK> in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near rape and by his work on documentaries but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural <UNK> beat up <UNK> i don't think i was the only person in the cinema laughing what i can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film <UNK> and <UNK> pictures both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years <UNK> distributed bullet boy code <UNK> and red road <UNK> doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath <UNK> and <UNK> take note is this really the best you can do what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement it's a big <UNK> on both of your <UNK> listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair
<START> an actor asks what's my motivation to understand his or her character after viewing this this <UNK> this vague and <UNK> farce a viewer wonders what anyone's motivation was br br this inept <UNK> of daytime t v the oprah show missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore <UNK> issues br br its characters were all shallow and superficial its story line far less socially redeeming than a simpsons episode it <UNK> portrayed investigating police as <UNK> and incompetent it failed to offer why the court might treat the main character a female child <UNK> so differently than it would have a male <UNK> br br why did this <UNK> woman begin <UNK> her second grade student beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class why did the boy's mother <UNK> in her behalf the simple answer is overwhelming <UNK> plus <UNK> <UNK> and greed the movie gave no hint of that br br why wasn't the viewer informed that the <UNK> mother sold interview rights to print and television <UNK> <UNK> her adolescent son on the today show that mary <UNK> lawyer <UNK> in she herself appealing a son of sam <UNK> so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest <UNK> br br why wasn't it explained that <UNK> father was a former right wing <UNK> <UNK> the 1972 american independent presidential candidate the john <UNK> society president in 1983 john <UNK> political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student exposed only when that mistress sexually <UNK> their <UNK> son yet <UNK> dad had removed his many kids from too liberal catholic schools fighting to keep all <UNK> from receiving any sex education br br a month after her <UNK> release again pregnant with the now 14 year <UNK> second daughter mary kay received 7 1 2 years in prison for numerous <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> regarding the sad affair then appeared in the seattle times at the end of two wretched hours <UNK> was led off to jail and this <UNK> <UNK> of made for tv <UNK> was over until casting begins br br sure enough 18 months later filming of this travesty was <UNK>
<START> how to lose friends and alienate people came out in 2008 it bombed at u s box <UNK> it's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast simon pegg is great playing sidney young who wrote the book how to lose friends and alienate people i know it's not a true story the only way i know that is because sidney wants to go out with an actress named sophie <UNK> sophie <UNK> doesn't exist but other than that the film could be real how to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 and i think you definitely should see it as i said earlier the film has a fantastic cast including kirsten dunst spider man the virgin <UNK> danny huston the number 23 30 days of night gillian anderson the x files <UNK> fox transformers <UNK> of a teenage drama queen jeff bridges the big <UNK> the <UNK> overall how to lose friends and alienate people is hilarious i think simon pegg and kirsten dunst do work well together and i think you should see it though there is some odd nudity including <UNK> <UNK> it's a hilarious and awesome comedy one of simon <UNK> best br br the plot sidney young a journalist from england travels down to new york to work at sharp magazines while there he meets an actress named sophie <UNK> and tries to sleep with her before his boss does
<START> how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones what a crime that two of them are already dead it reminds me of the dennis <UNK> joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever i'm <UNK> here but you get the idea br br rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of <UNK> kids fighting against their oppressive high <UNK> administration it's extremely silly stuff but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing even if they do resort to blowing up the building who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music <UNK> and that it could make a difference to the larger society it's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trust br br but most important this is pure exploitation br br take none of it seriously just go in and have a good time if this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies then it should have been
<START> it's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than <UNK> picture of the palestinian girl and her family the film and it's website tries to imply that <UNK> has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up a boyfriend problem perhaps <UNK> neatly <UNK> over is the fact that <UNK> had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the <UNK> just outside her home gosh so why on earth would a young pretty intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing could it be that the <UNK> emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie another neatly <UNK> detail is that <UNK> levy <UNK> mother could have prevented the destruction of the building the <UNK> family lived in along with 22 other families one distinctly gets the impression that she's offering this as a <UNK> should mrs <UNK> agree to speak with her why should i she says since the movie was made the home has been destroyed apparently the interview didn't result in what she wanted so bring on the <UNK> mrs levy claimed that she wanted the movie to be <UNK> as well as a symbol of hope a chance to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead she uses it as an excuse to <UNK> <UNK> mother while <UNK> the house as a <UNK> moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart she is so out of touch with the realities of the <UNK> for her palestinian neighbors that she really thinks that mrs <UNK> can just drop over for a cup of coffee please and she <UNK> the one chance she had to meet mrs <UNK> in person and see what kind of life she lives the <UNK> family originally came from <UNK> but now live <UNK> into a <UNK> camp only 4 miles from where the <UNK> live in <UNK> luxury any sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs levy is <UNK> by her air of self righteous <UNK> by contrast <UNK> mother comes off as kind <UNK> and loving in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters heck even the music and sound design was one sided i guess the <UNK> sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home always in a <UNK> <UNK> key from the sappy new age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary also there is the small matter of <UNK> mrs levy directly <UNK> the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time <UNK> when she doesn't mrs <UNK> spoke only <UNK> which received sometimes a translation sometimes <UNK> always awkward and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie they also <UNK> her under the lights while mrs levy sat in air <UNK> comfort rotten editing for mrs <UNK> segments too i gave it a 2 because i liked <UNK> mother and father who seemed like good decent people shame on hbo producers and director for releasing such a stink bomb
<START> the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's at one of our art houses as a revival as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality i thought <UNK> they got away with murder in europe back in the day unfortunately this film was heavily cut in it's original u s release by the blue <UNK> hayes office the <UNK> government censorship board started by the <UNK> than <UNK> bible <UNK> will hayes a former post office official if you can believe that due to it's overall theme of human sexuality <UNK> <UNK> humans actually had sex in the 1930's the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman played by hedy <UNK> who marries a much older man and later regrets it she <UNK> meets a handsome younger man has an affair with him resulting in a divorce from previous husband another no no in hollywood movies back then divorce despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933 it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format i e the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films i e <UNK> <UNK> it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures along with luis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1930 and karl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1931 not rated but contains that infamous nude swimming scene some <UNK> <UNK> sexual references which would fare little more than a pg 13 by today's standards but would have easily landed the <UNK> <UNK> back in the 30's if it existed then
<START> this is one of joan <UNK> best <UNK> it was the first gable crawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a <UNK> team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co stars br br the film convincingly depicts the <UNK> slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must <UNK> for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove <UNK> and they resort to underworld activity br br joan crawford is excellent as the <UNK> turned <UNK> she's smart complex and believable she even <UNK> the theatrical <UNK> of the other actors' early <UNK> acting style clark gable is a diamond in the rough <UNK> and gruff as the no nonsense gangster who becomes involved with <UNK> character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma <UNK> in a free soul <UNK> his position as top male sex symbol at mgm br br if you like crawford in this type of role don't miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early <UNK> performances br br
<START> prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser known smaller films the film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start it's an early directorial effort for <UNK> <UNK> the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo <UNK> the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting we focus on a prison that has been <UNK> after a number of years this was the prison where a man named charles <UNK> was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the <UNK> <UNK> naturally the spirit of the dead man is not <UNK> in peace and when the old execution room is <UNK> the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance br br the film is not exactly the <UNK> redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base this is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesn't really have a <UNK> to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights as the film goes on we start to delve more into the back story of the vengeful <UNK> ghost and while it's fairly interesting some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little still everything <UNK> down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down
<START> the title <UNK> the content of this movie somewhat which might lead to some <UNK> expectations frankly speaking there's very little panic in the streets to be seen here in fact throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be <UNK> the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters having said that what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because unlike the people in the streets the viewer knows what's going on and that director <UNK> kazan builds very deliberately as the plague infected killer is sought one of the more interesting <UNK> i found was the developing relationship between dr reed richard widmark and police captain warren paul douglas at the beginning the two really don't like each other even though they have to work together by the end they've <UNK> a real bond of respect for each other kazan did a good job with that br br pretty much all the performances here were excellent widmark and douglas were great and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical heavy role i found very little to criticize here perhaps barbara <UNK> <UNK> came across as a little bit flat as <UNK> wife nancy but her role wasn't really central to the story all in all an excellent piece of work 9 10
<START> old jane's mannered tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her <UNK> are our <UNK> even at this late date this tv mini series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel <UNK> <UNK> emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the <UNK> of jane <UNK> world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you haven't seem emma i'll only say that self sufficient emma does get her <UNK> it's worth watching to find out how the acting <UNK> here go to the ladies kate <UNK> lucy and samantha they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane
<START> dark wolf quick review let's get right to it this is a <UNK> piece of rotting <UNK> with cow sh t on it it's just an awful movie it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any <UNK> nerd from an 80's high school drama film what's worse is that poor kane <UNK> was <UNK> into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane f <UNK> <UNK> someone's trying to ensure that playing jason <UNK> is the height of his film career br br anyway former <UNK> <UNK> bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of near rampant nudity but that's about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black <UNK> <UNK> around the screen and when we're <UNK> enough to actually see a transformation sequence we're presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the <UNK> the first <UNK> the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 2 10 br br www <UNK> com
<START> i thought the movie was actually pretty good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell i have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the f x and stunts were well done a couple of <UNK> were the guy who played the camera <UNK> and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok
<START> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in <UNK> and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
<START> i've been impressed with <UNK> stance against <UNK> for sometime now but it wasn't until i saw the film at the <UNK> documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of coup conspiracy by <UNK> elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western <UNK> to remove <UNK> elected president chavez and return <UNK> back to a brutal <UNK> this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world i <UNK> the people of <UNK> for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of <UNK> and the bush regime
<START> this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you won't be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x files is in it david duchovny
<START> the <UNK> 2005 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis philip baker hall dylan baker brosnan gives one of his best non <UNK> roles as a middle aged assassin facing a mid life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman kinnear at his most <UNK> and discovers there is more to life than death <UNK> filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a <UNK> wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath of fresh air into the <UNK> <UNK> formula <UNK> what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya <UNK> out with <UNK> glee a sleeper gem indie hit
<START> considering it was made on a low budget the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work br br the story involves a family who are about to move into their <UNK> powered home in an isolated part of the <UNK> desert in <UNK> california only to find it <UNK> by motorcycle <UNK> they think but their youngest daughter natasha ryan has begun to see mysterious things a green <UNK> strange <UNK> figures etc and only recently the light from a <UNK> star explosion has caused extremely unusual <UNK> to show up in the desert <UNK> thus the family led by jim davis and dorothy malone finds themselves face to face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time and space <UNK> br br mixing in elements of 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind the day time ended despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films the day time ended is much better than many other 2001 close encounters knock offs i give credit to director john <UNK> <UNK> whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the <UNK> made for an interesting <UNK> to <UNK> for at least trying and on that basis i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10
<START> <UNK> little sister and i are self <UNK> horror movie buffs we have seen just about everything especially zombie flicks now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie make up was the worst i have seen if you can even call it make up black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your <UNK> a favor and do not watch this movie i was so <UNK> about this movie i went as far as putting a <UNK> note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying this movie sucks don't waste your time return now <UNK> i don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this <UNK> movie i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
<START> loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese <UNK> and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times i've seen this movie i can't help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
<START> this movie is nothing like office space except in the premise office space was hilarious i would not recommend this movie to anyone as i laughed not once during the entire film mr <UNK> self indulgent <UNK> quickly become more annoying than 15 jason <UNK> in the same room if you decide to see this movie use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary
<START> i have recently seen this production on dvd it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very <UNK> as the bbc serials were back then i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday <UNK> back then but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been i am a bit of a jane eyre <UNK> as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one i have recently re read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly <UNK> on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly br br all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the rivers family and their connection to jane altogether i also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctly br br the casting is perfect zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book small plain and dark and i disagree that she looked too old timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his <UNK> off i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they <UNK> their love for one another a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable oh to be loved by a man like that there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks br br finally if you never see another production of jane eyre you simply most see this one it is simply perfection
<START> i bought this movie for 1 euro not knowing what it was all about i thought hmmm a movie named <UNK> man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore it wasn't funny alright it was disturbing very disturbing and i don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing to do hmmm the quality of the images were terrible the acting there was no acting just some <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> himself for over 90 minutes this is probably material for <UNK> <UNK> off on extreme gore br br don't watch this it's not worth your time its just awful i wish i never bought this br br they should <UNK> the guy who made this
<START> i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night not knowing what to expect i had heard of this movie but never really any opinions on it br br i have to say i was impressed with what i saw i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times br br the blob was scary looking now i look in a jar of <UNK> and wonder if it'll <UNK> itself onto my hand br br steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews the protagonist of the film i also liked the old man in the beginning br br for a 50's horror movie this was very well done even by today's standards br br 8 10
<START> summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind besides she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status <UNK> of that century
<START> one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in <UNK> please don't watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful <UNK> of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme <UNK> and terror i hope there will be a 35 <UNK> copy soon <UNK> <UNK> first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few <UNK> i'm waiting for the second hit
<START> <UNK> <UNK> movies are usually worth your time meet me in st louis the bad and the beautiful i <UNK> this movie with great interest but what a disappointment br br some came running is scene after scene of go nowhere <UNK> sinatra is a sad sack returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships a disappointing <UNK> hanging on him living in disappointing <UNK> as a gal <UNK> him to finish his disappointing writing project the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and <UNK> and something disappointing happens the sequence is intended to be tension filled but <UNK> is no hitchcock he gets so distracted by pretty colors he doesn't notice the scene is a <UNK> cliché and the characters are so <UNK> drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot especially <UNK> but that's the only real cinematography in the project otherwise we look at <UNK> characters standing around bars living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours hell is other people apparently br br there is nothing going on in this movie the dilemma of soldiers returning to <UNK> and indifference after ww2 is handled more <UNK> in 'the best years of our lives ' and either of two <UNK> products <UNK> in the <UNK> and <UNK> covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead end town with much more <UNK>
<START> i didn't enjoy this film i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring a <UNK> old computer saving the day i thought that this was just slightly far fetched even for a film i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off why not take a <UNK> to it br br its a shame but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film it wasn't if that is what you want to watch do not watch this film br br even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day this would still in my opinion be a very very cheesy flick
<START> spoilers br br my dad had taped this movie for me when i was 3 by age 5 i had watched it over 400 times i just watched it and watched it and i still do today it has a grim storyline a <UNK> mother is killed by a wolf a very emotional scene and wants to become a wolf like him after years of training the <UNK> is made into a really really evil looking thing he and the wolf travel to his old <UNK> but he cannot kill the <UNK> no matter how much he wishes to he ends up killing the wolf but is no longer seen as a <UNK> by his former friends and can't return to his previous way of life br br the art is beautiful the songs are well okay and the voice acting is better than some things today br br all in all you just have to see this movie it is a great masterpiece although it's very hard to find today br br
<START> this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self <UNK> and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity <UNK> she literally makes a <UNK> with a devil like demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn't be worse the girl sees what she's done she feels <UNK> and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop <UNK> songs made the film even better
<START> the most amazing <UNK> uplifting movie about the <UNK> of the <UNK> far better than any other film or movie made about the <UNK> thus far if you haven't seen it hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now you won't regret it you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith you finally get some sort of <UNK> of the things the prophet had to fight through and the <UNK> he and his people faced if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter days saints and our humble <UNK> just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense afterward
<START> and i love it lots of special effects and for a movie that's not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece i'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch it's definitely up there in standards <UNK> bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a <UNK> of the budget of these international hits br br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the <UNK> of adventure movie to come out of hong kong the topic is exotic and original production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is great br br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the <UNK> affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope they'll continue working in this area until they <UNK> hollywood adventure movies br br just fantastic
<START> okay maybe not all of it <UNK> by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movie's cover but the horror the horror whatever you do do not watch this movie <UNK> out your eyes repeatedly bash your skull in do what it takes never again never forget br br
<START> this is pretty much a low budget made for tv type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original i'm a fan of b movies and this one might have been good had they not attached the name cube to it because as is the director and plot of the original were better and this movie just about ruined my taste for the entire series the characters are annoying and clichéd there are problems with continuity and several outright production screw ups the story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that they more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and over throughout the movie and because the first one was so good this simply turns out as a disappointment br br if this was a stand alone b movie i'd probably give it about a four the 1 rating i give it was pretty much a statement about how it utterly <UNK> in effects and intelligence as compared to the first
<START> anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the <UNK> and <UNK> will appreciate this film it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie plus it makes fun of the college film genre it's funny it's got a cast to die for amy <UNK> rachel <UNK> sophie monk parker posey jane lynch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud writer actor rachel <UNK> is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain wilson phillips <UNK> i'm just repeating myself now it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb
<START> this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy it is an extreme tragedy it left me sick to my stomach i hated it i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer i would not have seen this movie if i would have known i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie i am tired of it i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie i have never been more disappointed in a movie nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie no one would have seen it
<START> ah <UNK> the character name is <UNK> and forever <UNK> by the simpsons but it will also always  to me personally at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90's action flick directed by the cool dude who brought us the <UNK> and starring two of the most ultimately <UNK> b movie heroes christopher walken and michael <UNK> the latter with a cute little macho <UNK> i guess <UNK> will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure because there's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture the film is <UNK> preposterous most action heroes take on a small gangster <UNK>  <UNK> takes on an entire country and yet takes itself way too seriously the script is a non stop and incoherent <UNK> of clichéd situations nonsensical twists <UNK> sentimental <UNK> <UNK> staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings it's a totally delirious movie i loved it br br vietnam <UNK> <UNK> life is saved by fellow soldier <UNK> <UNK> on the very last day of the war they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that <UNK> is in <UNK> debt <UNK> years later <UNK> is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia <UNK> initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's <UNK> executed on el <UNK> balcony his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to <UNK> for financial assistance and <UNK> <UNK> and his former vietnam buddies who all <UNK> happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world <UNK> themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of <UNK> ass br br okay let's not fool each other here the fact you're reading a user comment on <UNK> already <UNK> that you have some sort of interest for low budget b movie action one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time <UNK> a list containing all the main <UNK> and <UNK> moments of <UNK> this list is totally accurate and i can only <UNK> with it heck i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list like the preposterous and needless heroic self sacrifice of a soldier who doesn't even have any <UNK> with the goal of the mission and the rest of <UNK> squad but what's the point you definitely know not to expect a 100 coherent and plausible masterpiece we know from beforehand this will be a silly and <UNK> flamboyant movie and it's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out this is a <UNK> outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into <UNK> and <UNK> war against the corrupt <UNK> president and the national drug <UNK> please don't expect another apocalypse now this particular motion picture relies on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> acting performances of the macho leads a whole lot of explosions and <UNK> and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan <UNK> sings a cover of brothers in arms
<START> i loved the the film it beautifully <UNK> italian petty <UNK> society how the <UNK> of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy <UNK> which they don't want disturbed for instance the aging <UNK> who is jealous of his own son and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth br br for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in italy no one in the book <UNK> knew about the film a great pity br br the one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm
<START> i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long and unfortunately it wasn't worth it even for a die hard lynch fan i found this to be really tedious br br nothing happens there are long long long painful pauses where nothing happens long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell it was all about what happened before and what happened afterward br br there was a <UNK> drive <UNK> the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita <UNK> and a lost highway moment with <UNK> to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly br br unfortunately it's all very uninteresting and very dull nothing happens it's very forgettable and i think i will <UNK> it from my computer and forget i ever watched it sorry david
<START> i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years but it still <UNK> me br br when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so <UNK> and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a <UNK> impression on the viewer not unlike a life changing event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film <UNK> me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional <UNK> that lasted for several days
<START> this is one of those films that i remember being in the can for years before anything happening w it i don't think it's terrible but it's not really good either alec baldwin was pretty good but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best the cast is pretty good in what they're given but again you are only as good as the script baldwin directing this although i could have <UNK> he didn't direct all of it i thought i read somewhere or lots of re shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there although his work on 30 rock is nothing short of genius should keep him busy for a little while longer i just hope the show <UNK> out <UNK> a la seinfeld but maybe not even that long 9 years it went so if you want to see a film that you won't get much from but won't really hate either well this is for you i can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released only on dvd at that it was nice to see alec baldwin anthony hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen the edge now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment
<START> cut is a full <UNK> spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous <UNK> serial killer <UNK> of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex that's hardly a spoiler br br the set up is simplicity itself film school <UNK> set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast this also neatly okay <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the first reel they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by molly <UNK> who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines the rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely jessica <UNK> who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore <UNK> around her br br there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate good soundtrack too if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre probably a bit of both
<START> this movie is so bad it's comical in fact mystery science theatre 3000 the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies used this very film to mock i suggest watching it maybe on youtube instead of actually seeing this movie br br please do not see hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene actually do not see this movie period please at least not seriously its jokes are not funny to say the least and you'll have much more fun <UNK> or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie br br you may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching so spare yourself read a book do the <UNK> anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins
<START> i have no idea how a <UNK> the director douglas <UNK> and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar winning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right here she is <UNK> on perfect as emma <UNK> she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this br br of course she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta <UNK> juliette stevenson et al jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script <UNK> a bit in his <UNK> of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on <UNK> hair is a little easier to take than it was in <UNK> and personally i find <UNK> alan <UNK> a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of <UNK> law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma <UNK> with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alone br br all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again but we'll always have emma
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the first colored movie of master <UNK> kurosawa and surprisingly is not about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> it is inside a very poor community in a <UNK> in tokyo where the <UNK> are homeless <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> abused women losers i do not know the reason why kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors but indeed they are very sad stories some of them heart breaking i personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters and the story of the young woman abused by her <UNK> my vote is nine br br title brazil <UNK>  o <UNK> da <UNK> <UNK>  the way of the life
<START> the second official episode of the columbo series murder by the book filmed later hit the <UNK> first robert <UNK> who would match wits with peter <UNK> detective in several future <UNK> is terrific as the short <UNK> head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a <UNK> wife when she refuses to cave in to his blackmail schemes the two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series
<START> hollywood hotel has relationships to many films like ella <UNK> and <UNK> of the movies about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood only to find the road to stardom either <UNK> with <UNK> or non existent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a <UNK> leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by <UNK> along on screen br br hollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s among the supporting players is <UNK> parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments i've seen she has a very <UNK> personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script make up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another br br this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio <UNK> at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the <UNK> when it should be used with more important people br br dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a <UNK> in benny <UNK> band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of <UNK> to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing <UNK> for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a <UNK> has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny <UNK> lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make up king <UNK> tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song <UNK> referred to looking like <UNK> power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to <UNK> the leading man of 20th century fox and the name donald duck was <UNK> in any event the number showed the singers and <UNK> of <UNK> orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is <UNK> br br powell leaves the band and his girl friend frances <UNK> and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving <UNK> he is met by allen <UNK> the <UNK> of the studio the owner is grant mitchell <UNK> is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to <UNK> off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the <UNK> <UNK> star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean <UNK> in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan <UNK> is one alexander <UNK> alan <UNK> scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that <UNK> is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being by passed for an out of the ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film <UNK> finds a double for her <UNK> real life sister <UNK> lane and <UNK> is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow up party but she <UNK> with powell <UNK> wanting someone who doesn't know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down <UNK> when the latter makes a <UNK> of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive br br the complications deal with lola coming back and <UNK> powell in the face after <UNK> complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of <UNK> <UNK> contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted <UNK> actually not too bad in this film he even tries to do a <UNK> imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a <UNK> stand run by bad <UNK> edgar kennedy the number of broken <UNK> and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be <UNK> singing voice in a rip off of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when <UNK> lane herbert and <UNK> help give powell his chance to show it's his voice not <UNK> br br it's quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to it's time several jokes concerning african americans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood <UNK> accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to <UNK> to watch out powell photographs too darkly get the point also a bit with <UNK> <UNK> as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in <UNK> and an incident where <UNK> nearly gets into a <UNK> at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december <UNK> but most of the film is quite good and won't disappoint the viewer in 2008
<START> the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time <UNK> where the past present and future <UNK> in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner director john bud <UNK> begins the film on a <UNK> mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger <UNK> and more exciting as the <UNK> story unfolds moreover <UNK> fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus jim davis as <UNK> <UNK> grant williams dorothy malone as his <UNK> wife <UNK> christopher mitchum as the concerned richard <UNK> <UNK> as his lovely wife beth natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny and scott c <UNK> as the <UNK> steve the funky special effects offer an inspired <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> neat stop motion animation monsters said creatures include a tiny <UNK> <UNK> guy a big <UNK> <UNK> beast and a <UNK> lizard dude and nifty <UNK> paintings richard <UNK> rousing full bore <UNK> score really hits the stirring spot john arthur <UNK> crisp sunny cinematography likewise does the trick a fun flick
<START> i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it slow moving bad dialogue lots <UNK> blood but this was worse than anything i could have imagined br br the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book br br with the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasn't that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out
<START> screenwriter lisa <UNK> began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 br br is she even in business if someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap she's up for the most fortunate person of ever award this movie sucks to no end it never <UNK> to <UNK> me what the turn into movies and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit seriously i can write better crap than this in my sleep br br ok so how many lines to i have to type i don't get this at all i guess i m a <UNK> i guess i don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say or a <UNK> seriously i don't care if you have a one word sentence or even a one word response i mean c'mon br br thanks is this enough finally br br this movie is worthless
<START> <UNK> michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies br br you'd think that after such dismal flicks superstar night at the <UNK> and <UNK> he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television as well trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense br br i personally like tim meadows and think that he would be great in the right movie it's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation and <UNK> it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad not because it's funny br br oh well at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them it's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen
<START> contrary to popular belief this title to me at least is not so very bad in fact i regard it as a <UNK> film of all time the <UNK> of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series however despite all this you can watch it quite happily for a feature film of its day the scenes are well <UNK> and the characters remain consistently believable br br the sound audio track is a personal favourite of mine nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their now badly cast us dub counterparts the sync is perfect in every shot i had a few issues with the casting for the <UNK> voices please forgive the crude <UNK> it has been a while since i've seen it otherwise however the cast seemed perfectly balanced i feel and believe in the characters of this movie <UNK> are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago i loved the <UNK> from back then but the <UNK> often let series down br br at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life it has historical value to me but even after seeing the original <UNK> 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection br br to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas personally i think its a big shame had the correct audience been subject to it i think <UNK> the movie would have been accepted and not <UNK> over the years i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title br br watching the film after its separate <UNK> will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows however without seeing the originals a viewer wouldn't really notice since the animation is identical in style there was no reason to question it back in its day the uk had very limited access to anime laser <UNK> were the most <UNK> media personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre i mean harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get <UNK> br br despite the few <UNK> faults people have had with this film the eighties feel of it keeps me in love if you watch <UNK> 23 now to its original japanese audio or the new dub i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the <UNK> cast your minds back to the original <UNK> crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e v e br br saying all this this film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its <UNK> on the open market personally it <UNK> a collection for me i'm now <UNK> the world for <UNK> from the three <UNK> that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl <UNK> ill shake his hand for the effort and buy him a <UNK> or a <UNK> for getting me into anime
<START> this is my favorite classic it was filmed a little west of philadelphia <UNK> when i was 13 in 1957 and released the next year then in 1970 i found myself working the very same county as a rookie <UNK> state <UNK> i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed i knew the owner of the <UNK> diner well and he had a road sign out front which told all passing <UNK> that this was the home of the blob the theater scene was in <UNK> near valley <UNK> park and it is still showing films today
<START> it is a frank <UNK> <UNK> that music <UNK> is people who can't write <UNK> people who can't talk for people who can't read if you ever needed proof that musicians can't talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at <UNK> stumble over themselves to end up in <UNK> comments delivered in <UNK> voices wow thank you <UNK> <UNK> this film is pretentious but while much of the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and his gang of merry men and one token woman <UNK> the music saves the day br br the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea <UNK> out of the <UNK> commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave <UNK> of <UNK> off the coast of <UNK> we are treated to <UNK> blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic <UNK> both in new orleans and <UNK> there's also a good deal of <UNK> own compositions br br sadly that's another weakness it's never entirely clear what <UNK> himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on <UNK> part he wants to play his own music <UNK> up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he <UNK> he's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the <UNK> museum br br the clash between the different <UNK> shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a <UNK> choir but <UNK> and most of his mates are <UNK> a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in <UNK> at the end of the film to be fair they turn up <UNK> and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of <UNK> why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the <UNK> and brazil <UNK> <UNK> then there's europe here the black <UNK> doesn't seem to have produced any musicians of <UNK> since <UNK> chooses to draft in <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> player from <UNK> are they in the team just because <UNK> has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s <UNK> black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of <UNK> <UNK> a k a <UNK> jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath <UNK> ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an <UNK> name is an <UNK> of their african roots and why do they think <UNK> islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesn't have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the <UNK> that present conditions are a consequence of all the <UNK> and best having been <UNK> away for 300 years the <UNK> appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and <UNK> <UNK> of their <UNK> and not above <UNK> the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that <UNK> and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of <UNK> br br there is also a strong <UNK> in the film that the slaves who were taken from <UNK> came from <UNK> the similarity between the folk <UNK> style of new orleans and the folk <UNK> style of <UNK> is <UNK> in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were <UNK> away was the <UNK> of their <UNK> <UNK> them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves <UNK> from <UNK> did not come from <UNK> they were captured or <UNK> from the interior by the <UNK> <UNK> and sold to <UNK> of <UNK> european power currently held the <UNK> slave <UNK> the people of <UNK> are not the <UNK> of <UNK> who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely  more likely  to be <UNK> of the people who sold their black <UNK> into slavery and <UNK> br br the two <UNK> clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which <UNK> and co have been <UNK> and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the <UNK> of the <UNK> slave <UNK> the other end comes when the harmony <UNK> sing the spiritual return to glory in the <UNK> <UNK> of the slave <UNK> this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears br br this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and <UNK> in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but don't expect enlightenment or intellectual <UNK>
<START> i can't for the life of me remember why i must have had a free ticket or something but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released i don't remember who i went with which theater i was in or even which city all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone <UNK> to call a film and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over unfortunately i stuck it out to end which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says look for problem child 2 coming soon that was hands down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film br br the plot if i recall correctly involved john ritter and perhaps his wife lord how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind <UNK> a problem child maybe they think they can <UNK> him or something i really don't know if that was their intent they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the <UNK> <UNK> most horrid demon <UNK> ever to hit the big screen forget <UNK> forget rosemary's baby this kid takes the cake the only difference is we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a problem child however this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed you want to kill him through the entire film and when spoiler like anyone cares john ritter decides to keep the vile hell child you will be yelling send him back in shocked disgust like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did br br this is only the second movie i have given a 1 to on the imdb the other was superman iv and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3 which he was not in came out he said something like the only way i would do another problem child sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform <UNK> to that br br i would rather watch a 24 hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again 1 10 only because i can't give it a negative score which is what it really deserves someone burn the original <UNK> of this film please
<START> it's a bad very bad movie br br well for people a real realistic movie is a good thing for me it is not life is also predictable bad nasty trivial senseless sometimes maybe that's the reason for people say that this film is real br br too many common places you're black you're a criminal you're doomed and cursed whatever you do you'll end up by shooting or being shot by someone don't let the kids play with the weapons it could be dangerous and then there are those who go to the church and then they are good very good br br before this one i hadn't seen such a bad movie that's perhaps the reason for i never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie in this one every scene shot in daytime <UNK> is clearly and annoyingly blue they didn't even care to correct the colour balance oh i've rated more than 300 movies in this <UNK> so far and this 3 10 is my lowest ever
<START> this is only the second time i stopped a video dvd part way through br br i was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clichéd and stupid and <UNK> plodding and pretentious br br it was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him creepy and sad with voice over narration that only the most <UNK> adolescent would consider poetry and some singing and no really the poor child's suffering br br enough already especially when it <UNK> into a <UNK> clumsy and insulting clockwork orange ripoff and did i mention the singing br br this isn't the worst film i've ever seen but certainly the one i've felt least compelled to sit through i don't recommend it to anyone
<START> i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake br br i can't write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a <UNK> turtle for laughs in my book that's not funny that's pathetic br br low budget <UNK> if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money br br acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don't even come across as sexy let alone funny br br this movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category it's just bad as if everybody involved was sick of it br br avoid
<START> worry not disney fans this special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella won't turn into a <UNK> at the strike of midnight one of the most enduring animated films of all time the disney <UNK> adaptation of the gory brothers <UNK> fairy tale became a classic in its own right thanks to some memorable tunes including a dream is a wish your heart makes <UNK> <UNK> boo and the title song and some <UNK> cute comic relief the famous <UNK> click for larger image we all know the story the wicked stepmother and <UNK> simply won't have it this <UNK> cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart but <UNK> animal buddies and a well timed entrance by a fairy <UNK> make sure things turn out all right there are a few striking sequences of pure animation for example cinderella is reflected in <UNK> <UNK> through the air and the design is rich and <UNK> throughout it's a simple story padded here <UNK> with comic business particularly <UNK> <UNK> pals dressed up <UNK> like the dwarf <UNK> of another famous disney heroine and their <UNK> with a wretched cat named <UNK> there's also much <UNK> and exposition <UNK> by the king and the grand duke it's a much simpler and more <UNK> work than the more <UNK> paced animated films of today which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly <UNK>
<START> one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the <UNK> of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very <UNK> and a self <UNK> the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold case style thriller it is an intelligent <UNK> <UNK> style horror film that will put off gore <UNK> in search of cheap thrills br br some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very old style and <UNK> it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a low budget film no doubt but <UNK> viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem
<START> deep sh is more like it the <UNK> are just <UNK> in over the film think the incredible mr <UNK> meets <UNK> very tacky br br no character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very corny and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must miss
<START> all day now i've been watching dinosaurs and all day they've had the same fundamental problem br br they don't believe in <UNK> they just don't seem to have been told about them or something bullets <UNK> off of dinosaurs maybe it's because they became <UNK> millions of years before the invention of <UNK> and the laws of physics were just different back then <UNK> no come on if they're close enough to <UNK> operate today they'd have to be vulnerable to fast even <UNK> lead <UNK> it's that simple br br look the <UNK> skinned <UNK> on the planet today <UNK> and <UNK> are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire they're nothing magic you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy <UNK> on their backs they don't take armor <UNK> bullets or anything special small bullets <UNK> them they just don't kill them somewhat but not really large bullets are preferred because the challenge as with most game is to kill the animal with one shot so it doesn't run hunters consider it <UNK> to allow prey to run off and die <UNK> br br most animals including <UNK> are easily <UNK> by <UNK> between the noise and the pain of even a non lethal wound most will run away an exception are big bears which are so <UNK> that they're merely <UNK> by mortal wounds cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded we've seen video of the big <UNK> of a herd of cape buffalo <UNK> a <UNK> from an entire pride of lions a big cat will run if it can but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation where a t rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown their behavior simply has not been observed with these larger animals safe hunting becomes a matter of <UNK> an appropriately large and powerful <UNK> and or <UNK> several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge with a t rex of course this could be a serious problem i've seen a t rex skull they have one in the museum downtown and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be <UNK> chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more <UNK> approach small bullets would still <UNK> them they wouldn't just <UNK> off just because the animal is too big to easily kill br br so here we have cortez and his men this is before the famous mexican campaign apparently captured by american natives and <UNK> for sacrifice on the <UNK> it appears that all those human sacrifices were about <UNK> the <UNK> of the pair of t <UNK> that <UNK> the continent in the day rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the <UNK> cortez et al talk the <UNK> into letting them hunt kill them ok maybe they don't have m <UNK> like the guys in the <UNK> series but they do have <UNK> <UNK> pointed sticks big ones made from trees and swords maybe that's a little less uneven than <UNK> of soldiers with full auto but they've several guys and i'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur oh wait there's a cannon about a 4 <UNK> that's just the ticket for <UNK> a <UNK> skull so they lay a trap with a squad of men cannon pointed sticks in a <UNK> and lure the first t rex into it using a pretty brown girl as bait cortez points out that they'll not have time to <UNK> so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim t rex totally ignores their <UNK> of <UNK> fire and we see both a <UNK> <UNK> and the cannon ball <UNK> off forget it end of credibility a <UNK> <UNK> would defeat <UNK> <UNK> armor and a 4 cannon ball might <UNK> the <UNK> of a wooden ship this would also certainly get through the hide <UNK> or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet do you think a whale could <UNK> a 4 cannon ball and here's t rex still standing not even bleeding so cortez <UNK> it to the <UNK> where it falls onto the pointed sticks which i guess by magic <UNK> it and kill it <UNK> pointed sticks br br the <UNK> aren't completely <UNK> to <UNK> they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol this runs it off so it's not as mean as a bear or a buffalo at least in the movies br br they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb made from a <UNK> filled with <UNK> and <UNK> my money would still be on the cannon it's <UNK> function is to concentrate all the <UNK> energy in one direction toward the target a bomb is a much more <UNK> <UNK> of force a real bomb not a <UNK> bomb has a steel <UNK> which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure think <UNK> bomb vs <UNK> a pile of <UNK> set on fire will simply go <UNK> trust me on that one
<START> <UNK> should be <UNK> for attempting to <UNK> one of the great works of english fiction into a movie and then slapped silly for this attempt the animation was poor the characters looked ridiculous the music was <UNK> <UNK> and the film was a <UNK> <UNK> through the first book and a half of <UNK> masterpiece i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it now i realize that any attempt to <UNK> a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways simply because of the medium but this movie regardless of the source of the story is just plain pathetic <UNK> is capable of much more
<START> i love this anime i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence mostly from <UNK> <UNK> reluctant but short <UNK> <UNK> is so slapstick however <UNK> does deserve it but he does try his best to make <UNK> clumsily the main character <UNK> goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed <UNK> spring and turns into a girl when <UNK> by cold water from then on it's pure chaos one after another among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of <UNK> and <UNK> the sexy <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> all causing trouble for our hero heroine however it is <UNK> selfish father <UNK> who winds up being the <UNK> for the mess most of the time if anyone want an anime that's funny this is the one it's <UNK> and better with the japanese dub
<START> from the acting direction <UNK> and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention br br dr <UNK> is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake <UNK> scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of <UNK> to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the <UNK> to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed br br compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me unless its the directors family
<START> the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j horror movie this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks br br the story is about perception of the people who works lives and loves of our protagonist and how he <UNK> the people who <UNK> him in an <UNK> radio station dj booth the story <UNK> back the layers of the main character like an <UNK> in flash backs as the movie runs its course and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems the movie mostly took place in a small out dated radio <UNK> studio with a very bad history where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re <UNK> it is from this confined space that this movie <UNK> and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co workers or it was all in his mind what i like about this film is that the film makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did this movie is a very smart <UNK> rather short <UNK> minutes film
<START> when a small <UNK> of space age silly <UNK> lands on earth it soon begins <UNK> <UNK> and putting on weight the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars this dog had so many holes it could be <UNK> and sold for swiss cheese this thing actually made 20 million bucks and <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> all were vastly <UNK> the <UNK> looked a lot like a large <UNK> and the <UNK> looked as though they could have children approaching their teen age years and those <UNK> from the shotgun sounded like a <UNK> rifle with a sound <UNK> the ending was <UNK> trite obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel and there were many thumbs down
<START> good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history very good acting and script not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes <UNK> be prepared to <UNK> into the <UNK> spirit and human ability to <UNK> very touching as well for the <UNK> mature not for people who do not like to think
<START> i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie <UNK> del toro shouldn't work in production of movies he should put accent on his acting and that's it steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution about it's ideals and most important about life of che guevara and so on camera is awful like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it music is i don't know is there some music in the movie i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one it's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the tv or whatever i can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars disaster disaster disaster disaster don't watch please save yourself from this misery of movie
<START> <UNK> is my favorite movie it is a great story and also <UNK> others br br the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see <UNK> thompson in <UNK> years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the <UNK> accident <UNK> and hurt the movie br br the 20th <UNK> of the <UNK> accident is coming up i knew one of the <UNK> <UNK> off and on since childhood on the <UNK> <UNK> campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot br br i was the technical review last year for national <UNK> for the boy <UNK> <UNK> merit <UNK> and i still find <UNK> a great movie to recommend to <UNK> doing the space related merit <UNK> i teach br br i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of <UNK> education we had put together when <UNK> blew up i wound up sitting in with <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> invisible going over things after the accident at the <UNK> <UNK> meeting by chance as a result so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the <UNK> engineer who told them not to fly <UNK> in 1986 and who later built <UNK>
<START> philo vance had many <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> he was a gentleman with the kind of polish and <UNK> only usually associated with the british upper classes and he was also <UNK> <UNK> br br but there were vital <UNK> <UNK> was an <UNK> charming <UNK> <UNK> vance could be pompous <UNK> dull and self <UNK> there was a hint of fundamental cruelty in his <UNK> br br the <UNK> murder case is the most impressive of the 14 vance films made between <UNK> and <UNK> the story of a murdered collector of <UNK> it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery  exotic setting in the blue nose long island <UNK> club three killings for vance to solve including a <UNK> locked room murder the key to the whole affair and plenty of <UNK> br br usually a detective story setting have proved too static and <UNK> to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the <UNK> page but here michael <UNK> direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its <UNK> br br william <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> made him the perfect vance and although a year later he switched studios he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular the thin man at <UNK>
<START> 'the shop around the corner 1940 ' is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation by 1940 director <UNK> lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his famed lubitsch touch had become a <UNK> commercial trademark this film was planned for a 1939 release but <UNK> conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret <UNK> were <UNK> for filming rather than <UNK> either of his main stars lubitsch decided to <UNK> production in the meantime directing greta garbo in <UNK> 1939 ' when it was finally completed 'the shop around the <UNK> appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role time nevertheless has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence with high profile remakes including <UNK> the good old <UNK> 1949 ' and <UNK> got mail 1998 ' br br at its surface one might assume 'the shop around the <UNK> to simply be the story of two lovers <UNK> novak <UNK> and alfred <UNK> stewart who love each other without knowing it however <UNK> film runs much deeper than that it's the story of <UNK> and company a stylish gift shop in <UNK> and the various human relationships that make the store such a close <UNK> family when store owner hugo <UNK> frank morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work there's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states  perhaps in the <UNK> streets of new york  but lubitsch was deliberately <UNK> the passions and memories of his former years in europe the <UNK> of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every <UNK> this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film  in fact even as i write this review i'm beginning to appreciate the story even more br br <UNK> and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but i think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable i especially liked how lubitsch <UNK> directed much of our sympathy towards hugo <UNK> who in any other film would have been <UNK> to an underdeveloped two dimensional portrayal <UNK> may have lost the love of his family but he <UNK> it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a christmas eve <UNK> he finds <UNK> in a <UNK> faced young <UNK> boy charles smith this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy <UNK> later creations for example boom boom jackson in 'the fortune cookie 1966 ' or <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> 1972 ' of course it doesn't really need saying but billy wilder learned from the best
<START> i mean really how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink ball like <UNK> out i mean it should never got the green light to begin with the story is repetitive the characters are weak at best there is no real story on <UNK> other then he's a bad dude then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending that's right a bad ending <UNK> rises the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in then a picture of <UNK> comes to life cheaply i might add and chases her out then as she is walking home ala <UNK> a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago <UNK> for no reason just to collapse on top of her i mean that makes no sense what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of <UNK> to be made with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies they could have asked me i had better ideas then <UNK> <UNK> turkey
<START> the photography on the dvd is so dark i thought the screen had died i think i missed seeing half of the movie still it was poorly crafted and not interesting i did not find the story related to the title the black widow i was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames i rented the movie especially for willem dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent i do not believe <UNK> <UNK> has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture she is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie although they are married in real life they lack chemistry on the screen their relationships did not seem believable i do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot
<START> film version of sandra <UNK> one woman off broadway show is <UNK> pretentious sandra spoofs <UNK> acts and <UNK> but her sense of irony is only <UNK> interesting and <UNK> funny her fans will say she's <UNK> honest and that may be true but she's also shrill with an <UNK> in your face <UNK> that isn't well suited to a film in this genre she doesn't want to make nice and she's certainly not out to make friends and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas <UNK> served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his <UNK> detached signature style all over it <UNK> co wrote the show with director john <UNK> their <UNK> touch was in having all of <UNK> in house audiences looking completely bored a feeling many real viewers will most likely share 1 2 from
<START> cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story br br the film overall plays out like it's some kind of nightmare thus building and <UNK> a good atmosphere we're never sure of what exactly is going on we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream  the ambiguity <UNK> over us all  hero included and i haven't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry <UNK> brazil going with the <UNK> stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there's something in there for everyone and it <UNK> its elements well br br there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually aren't people who say they're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually <UNK> than they look despite a lot of switching things around <UNK> the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they're not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy <UNK> character  and she's trying to help out the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage <UNK> and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini cold war something that resembles the u s a and the u s s r in their war of <UNK> <UNK> and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi <UNK> screen that i was glued to br br what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer <UNK> as our hero flies to and from his stated <UNK>  significant then how the more he acts on his and <UNK> own motivation this sequence disappears because he's breaking away from the <UNK> repetitive controlled life that he's being told to live and is <UNK> out br br <UNK> is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the sci fi genre isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film
<START> i don't remember <UNK> jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character <UNK> out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the <UNK> was betty lee <UNK> asking her father in law <UNK> jones buddy <UNK> how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show br br one thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry <UNK> excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see <UNK> in a role other than jed <UNK> despite <UNK> being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it br br update 1 11 2009 i watched an interview with composer jerry <UNK> on youtube through their archive of american television channel let's just say that i was more kind than <UNK> about the show <UNK> jones
<START> whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake <UNK> film is incomprehensible br br this new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she <UNK> a <UNK> the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i've never walked out of a movie br br but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly <UNK> that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took <UNK> movie and turned it into another blue <UNK> br br this is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on <UNK> time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
<START> i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on dvd br br i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old in the <UNK> and i was very impressed by it it was shown before walt disney's jungle book br br what i remember of this movie is <UNK> i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle this impressed me very much for some reason he was thrown out of his village did not grasp the reason for this when other boys threw stones at him he <UNK> a rock and jumped off at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend as an eagle he was still wearing his <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> as someone who was born to a german mother and english father who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp i come from unique position one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the <UNK> of ww2 on the other this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler's state of mind in this the series does quite well <UNK> is very good as is o'toole i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career what was going through <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mind it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships but i hope it will make people research the subject more it might also make people understand why someone like <UNK> <UNK> cannot be allowed to continue in power
<START> i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it a group of tourists supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada run <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> mutant something or other and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes <UNK> wrong turn only problem is unless i <UNK> there's only one mutant on display and he isn't all that impressive sort of like the <UNK> mummy in that <UNK> film from about five years ago some gory but silly deaths help but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief the ending is predictable and has been done to death no pun intended
<START> this couldn't have been better the strong <UNK> on mike <UNK> expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career young tyler <UNK> drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time br br this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard <UNK> <UNK> this is a father son story which basically employs the two candidates solely <UNK> for the roles mike sullivan had no father as a child so john rooney took him in although a generous man mr rooney involved himself in organized crime therefore the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business now sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe but at the same time pay back his boss the events to follow will test <UNK> loyalty and embrace his family's fate br br with a great adaptation by david self the dialogue comes out <UNK> but yet very <UNK> the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting brilliant art direction by richard l johnson nancy <UNK> covered with a dark rainy snow on the ground exterior driving the story is thomas <UNK> wonderful irish score <UNK> in only when necessary br br but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l <UNK> beautiful photography this is some of the best cinematography i've seen and i watch a lot of films the scene when mike and michael are in the car entering chicago is quite impressive the shot starts at the front of the car revealing mike hanks through the <UNK> it subsequently <UNK> around to the side of the car to see michael <UNK> awakening and <UNK> out his side window as it continues it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> back completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous <UNK> 1930's chicago br br with a great cast and crew the principle man creates a <UNK> amazing film i'm talking about sam <UNK> who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty won him various awards before american beauty <UNK> worked as a play director for the british theater but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater with only two films sam <UNK> has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors in a list of about twenty five br br the film <UNK> a <UNK> genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly the photography acting and story is <UNK> i'm still waiting for <UNK> gangs of new york but for now i'm fully confident in saying that this is the best film of the year considering it's competition signs insomnia minority report thats a strong statement
<START> while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have <UNK> the multiple bad guys <UNK> double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed i really didn't feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally <UNK> it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross i'm surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project br br don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie
<START> i wouldn't call it awful but nothing at all shines in this movie and it is <UNK> with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development it starts out well but once the main hit is done it <UNK> into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic for example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all <UNK> no explanation for that how credible is it that a airport <UNK> area is going to have lights that flash on and off <UNK> and just enough to let snipes do his incredible escape <UNK> this is one of far too few action scenes <UNK> by <UNK> drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into <UNK> belief br br in addition the whole premise seems to be that the united states cia team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying national security to the brits this gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far <UNK> from reality to be satisfying br br there are a lot better action movies out there better <UNK> better executed this one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring something that should never happen in a good action movie
<START> a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her <UNK> by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement of course b horror movie queen <UNK> stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael <UNK> in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with <UNK> <UNK> and the last twenty minutes of <UNK> bloody rampage are quite fun to watch the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful better watch <UNK> or alien dead again of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred <UNK> ray but haunting fear is too dull to be enjoyable
<START> if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you nope you'll hate it however for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film br br tony randall works for the irs and he <UNK> a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an <UNK> tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they <UNK> on him and treat him like one of the family and have plans on getting him <UNK> to their daughter debbie reynolds that's really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting a really nice little <UNK> from the late 1950s
<START> sometime in 1998 <UNK> had acquired the rights to produce a brand new ninja <UNK> live action series naturally being a fan of the <UNK> back in the day this obviously <UNK> my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later more like recently i got a chance to <UNK> the series br br first off let's talk about some of the <UNK> they managed to re create the <UNK> <UNK> as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and <UNK> and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of <UNK> and <UNK> were <UNK> and seemed pretty <UNK> for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series br br people tend to complain about getting rid of <UNK> quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have <UNK> get beat so many times before it gets boring and <UNK> his worth as a villain and besides most fans don't realize or don't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the <UNK> was <UNK> in the very first issue never mind the countless <UNK> that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of <UNK> because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that <UNK> in small <UNK> work best because then his encounters with the <UNK> are all the more memorable br br unfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja <UNK> show and with these new magic wielding <UNK> comes a new female magic wielding turtle the infamous <UNK> de milo i'll be honest i never got comfortable with her i'm not against the idea of a female turtle i'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja <UNK> who seem somewhat out of their <UNK> i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the <UNK> de milo show dealing with her make believe enemies and the <UNK> are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the <UNK> this was released fortunately they all share the spotlight together br br next <UNK> was <UNK> after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live <UNK> of the <UNK> could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series as it stands next <UNK> is one of those <UNK> in <UNK> that is best left buried and forgotten
<START> evidently lots of people really like this but i found it <UNK> and reasonably offensive <UNK> saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers especially the opener but there's a marked <UNK> in invention later on i don't get on with monroe she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb but she just comes over as dumb russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a <UNK> but is otherwise rather wonderful the men are <UNK> uninteresting as is the plot by no means atrocious but so <UNK> that if this is a classic god help us all
<START> a great film the acting from the doctor to the <UNK> artist to the head prostitute with very few exceptions was wonderful i thought <UNK> <UNK> mrs noble and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were the best of the lesser known actors even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who might be accused of overacting presented quite a believable and familiar character br br another great thing was the camera work and the way it captured the energy of <UNK> streets the <UNK> of <UNK> saying his <UNK> and life within the tiny apartments br br i liked the story of the wall that becomes a <UNK> and then gets broken down and the artists philosophical take on it br br it's great to see good movies on indian themes
<START> with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies it's supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody <UNK> in unfortunately it falls flat very soon br br you're never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but you're supposed to think it's funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny i e the side by side phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating <UNK> <UNK> superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes <UNK> to be a cult classic but it doesn't make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a <UNK> group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any 8 year old with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult film br br there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois <UNK> she is a thin <UNK> reporter but has an endearing personality loves to <UNK> and is a natural <UNK> unfortunately she is put to bad use here br br attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the director's cut it has <UNK> by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african <UNK> it can be found in english on the out of print tape
<START> how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural <UNK> and be free most of us i suspect shall we dance is not a movie about dancing it is about learning about ourselves <UNK> what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it mr <UNK> is a middle aged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as <UNK> behaviour br br one day mr <UNK> sees a beautiful girl <UNK> out of the window of a dancing <UNK> he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of <UNK> he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family br br there is a hilarious scene in the <UNK> at the office when <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> who also dances are interrupted <UNK> some dance steps there are many other funny and warm hearted scenes br br the ending is not a fairytale but it leaves the viewer feeling good br br this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see
<START> i thought this movie was lol funny it's a fun not to be taken seriously movie about one man's twisted views on life love and well ladies from the <UNK> bus station <UNK> to the high class <UNK> bus station <UNK> tim meadows plays a guy leon <UNK> who was raised by in a playboy style mansion by a hugh <UNK> esquire father figure surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses when his father kicks him out on the street he must learn to <UNK> for himself with nothing but the <UNK> <UNK> on life that his youth has taught him that and an <UNK> nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck and so the <UNK> begin if you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light hearted semi mindless comedy love story then i highly recommend renting the <UNK> man
<START> i don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club they are today's equivalent to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the 20th century their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans as well as <UNK> of humans the world over who don't happen to share their <UNK> cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen the lies they <UNK> and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lost are they in their fantasy sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy however the 700 club is in a class by itself they are truly a cult while i believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lies <UNK> and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who <UNK> themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all treatment for such <UNK> individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion the 700 club though is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of <UNK> but due to the 700 <UNK> vast wealth <UNK> daily from the millions of americans locked in their <UNK> grip they are above the law in this country for those of you who have seen the movie the matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the <UNK> who drain the ones they have trapped and <UNK> abuse for their own selfish purposes and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being <UNK> of their life force represent those many people who belong to <UNK> and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them br br in less civil times the good <UNK> would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with <UNK> and <UNK> but in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague br br the television ratings system and the v chip on tv's should also have a rating called r for religion so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country from themselves and their children
<START> in <UNK> heights <UNK> we never had a <UNK> in any of the <UNK> schools <UNK> so i <UNK> my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game true i was 11 but i thought it was the greatest thing on i'd draw hidden pictures on my <UNK> and see if my family or friends could find it i also remember winning wonderful cars <UNK> or <UNK> if the contestant got the final hidden picture game i even had the home version br br i wonder why this game lasted so briefly i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one i could ever get was the <UNK> hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream br br really good memories are connected with <UNK>
<START> it is only robert de niro film which i really hates it is stupid film with horrible acting of course not de niro for me brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface 1983 or the <UNK> 1987 i also loved de palma's mission impossible 1996 de niro worked with palma two different times too <UNK> and the wedding party i though that the wedding party was ok too i didn't watch <UNK> br br screenplay is really bad and unfunny there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a be black baby scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual <UNK> appeared so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that
<START> excellent pirate entertainment it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention an absorbing tale of intrigue a fiery lady pirate named <UNK> stevens maureen o'hara who's attracted to the irresistible mr hawke errol flynn who is out on a secret mission of his own they make a fine romantic pair <UNK> sigh br br anthony quinn is the mean bad pirate <UNK> his villainous web of <UNK> and <UNK> i noticed the very familiar face of mildred <UNK> playing a supporting role as mrs <UNK> the <UNK> of young princess <UNK> alice <UNK> br br there is beautifully filmed scenery of <UNK> ships and the bay lots of action too of sword fighting <UNK> ship battles daring leaps of errol flynn robin hood on board ship from the <UNK> <UNK> herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she <UNK> great command of the <UNK> and could also <UNK> flynn in sword fighting in those days but <UNK> be no need to put it to the test here br br very enjoyable movie
<START> dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives <UNK> to <UNK> off each others husbands it s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never <UNK> its potential imagine how good this could have been if we had the <UNK> brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter <UNK> br br oh is carter based on jerry springer just curious because the catch phrase on dr <UNK> s show is look after each other and keep talking
<START> after two long long opening skits one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free we start the fast forward fest that it groove tube proper naturally uber stupid frat boys who still <UNK> jackass or tom green will find the idea of <UNK> matter coming out of the some tube sex <UNK> i really don't need to give you details do i and a clown who basically does the not very endearing clown bit i think i've seen <UNK> ninety times now will eat this up like dung <UNK> well more power to you br br i just want to express that despite what you've heard this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different everything you always wanted to know about sex and so on and done way better
<START> i really enjoyed the 60's not being of that generation i'm waiting for the 80's it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era br br one major problem in the movie however was how <UNK> the film was in the portrayal of the families according to <UNK> i saw for the movie on nbc the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960's america now i may have missed something but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american family br br i really think that the 60's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors all of which are very talented this is very visible at the end of the first part about two hours in of the mini series br br very good movie
<START> this is an absolutely charming film one of my favourite romantic comedies it's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means <UNK> to play only classical theatre he manages the transition from the cynical divorce <UNK> who tries to avoid women and their <UNK> ways to the <UNK> puppy that falls for lady x played by <UNK> <UNK> effortlessly the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well i highly recommend it
<START> only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from <UNK> is heartbreaking one with <UNK> <UNK> bob <UNK> makes its point twist by twist until the final shot <UNK> things br br the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips <UNK> paris the others are so <UNK> shot in theme tone <UNK> production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials 2006 it's really all over the place it doesn't develop over it's running time and nothing <UNK> the directors in no <UNK> successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in i'm at the one hour twenty minute point and <UNK> wood is in some dumb over commercial <UNK> vampire <UNK> it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies <UNK> in the <UNK> fantasy shows up i think first in the <UNK> brothers segment uh thanks j e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you don't need make believe crap to make your days extraordinary why <UNK> it by neighborhood if <UNK> de la madeleine is <UNK> with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more over represented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés br br making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty <UNK> the transitions get lost this doesn't feel intentional it feels sloppy
<START> forbidden <UNK> is based upon the <UNK> 2 <UNK> 2 so many <UNK> game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully br br there's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo <UNK> and his children daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and son <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> come to move into the villagers don't look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the <UNK> on the island to stay <UNK> once the <UNK> starts <UNK> br br naturally and slowly things start to go <UNK> and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this <UNK> island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with what's going on as <UNK> and fairy tales get thrown in to <UNK> the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its <UNK> ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful <UNK> at its sheer stupidity until it's explained much later it's one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with <UNK> covered br br despite it <UNK> in under 90 minutes i think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime <UNK> it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow <UNK> to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but it's a classic case of too little too late br br what saves the movie is how it changes <UNK> and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of <UNK> an audience it turned out rather <UNK> but leaves a bad <UNK> as you'll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel it either <UNK> the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden <UNK> <UNK> more to the latter br br the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit it's still not worth the time so better to avoid this
<START> a bug's life is like a favorite candy bar it's chock full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty br br the story couldn't have been better it's clever has heart emotion and every character has a nice arc a growth or change by comparison the only characters in toy story to have an arc are buzz who learns to love being a toy and woody who <UNK> his <UNK> of buzz there are tons of laughs and cute moments in a bug's life all of the actors turn in great voice work and the animation both the motion and detail is superb br br this serious movie buff doesn't throw around 10 s lightly but this movie certainly deserves the 10 i gave it
<START> we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people i'm not even a <UNK> of the culture in any way and found this to be a <UNK> piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate this is a <UNK> waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad who acts this way nobody br br the writer's name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community even mediocre films like a stranger among us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck reading this guy's credits it's no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars shocking perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness what ever happened to the great barry <UNK> he directed two of my all time favorites in <UNK> and diner he had some fine movies as well <UNK> but always provided something of interest until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring envy is the definition of boring never of big fan of pure slap stick dumb and dumber i was just stunned at how god awful this movie is there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing if you can pay attention that long the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a <UNK> sound alike if the film had been written as well as the song it would have been tolerable rachel <UNK> is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy even <UNK> moore but the real world exposes one weaknesses snl cast member amy <UNK> is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller the first work <UNK> together flashes some promise but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script this script is like most of jack <UNK> character's ideas not a bad thought but no hope for success
<START> while originally reluctant to jump on the <UNK> of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season <UNK> one with the polar <UNK> it has had my <UNK> attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear <UNK> with me while i throw out as much rambling semi coherent praise as i can <UNK> br br lost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and <UNK> drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common <UNK> for many things in their lives whether they're running away from something <UNK> and kate among others or getting in touch with <UNK> locke claire but lost also <UNK> in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connected br br while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts <UNK> heart and humour in their performances there's also a <UNK> of <UNK> but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable <UNK> petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly <UNK>  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters <UNK> an already well <UNK> plot br br about this plot imagine a tree as the <UNK> plot then the <UNK> as subplots in this case one branch for every character  well lost adds <UNK> to each branch and then tiny <UNK> to those <UNK> as other story lines if you're a brother sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you're a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to <UNK> them all together into some glorious <UNK> in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop out to this show as i'm sure most people are br br but assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit television br br 9 10
<START> imagine the worst a team episode add even more bad taste remove humor and you might get an idea of how despicable this movie is looks like a teenager stole <UNK> camcorder and filmed the explosion of his little sister <UNK> model house pathetic
<START> if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie then you should just see it instead of <UNK> 2 hours you'll never get back i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re first a special <UNK> force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an <UNK> and <UNK> projection and this <UNK> rip off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time there's even a chess reference in the code names which was in the dialog of re despite the fact that there are no zombies the <UNK> the movie's nemesis is some sort of bio creature very <UNK> in color suggesting <UNK> <UNK> with a lot of cyborg <UNK> just like a super mutant of re so a <UNK> of the finger to mr richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story br br they are not the same movie obviously but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think
<START> playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 years later this <UNK> little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well <UNK> first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden the film relies on pure characters with simple effective and yes believable dialogue to carry it thru and it achieves its aims <UNK> no little amount of suspense keeps the film <UNK> along and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it <UNK> to so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type br br 7 10
<START> no it's not the horror movie this one is actually a love story br br the ring is a silent film from <UNK> that stars two <UNK> and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly <UNK> with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion she comes back to one <UNK> corner just when things look their <UNK> and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back br br this film was very early in <UNK> career but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film although there are special film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been extremely <UNK> for the time period though with the shameless <UNK> wife that may have been the draw back in <UNK> while looking through all of these old films it is amazing how i think that they could be <UNK> on today's screen and really come off maybe i should be the one br br skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock's films you could fall asleep in the middle
<START> this is the second british rank film to adapt the stories of <UNK> <UNK> to film all but one story from <UNK> does not travel well into the <UNK> era and the actors speech is decidedly <UNK> as only british pre 1950's actors delivery can be in <UNK> <UNK> seems <UNK> and more <UNK> than the first film adaptation br br one of the problems these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25 30 years prior to the films consequently by the 1950's <UNK> pre war <UNK> small morality <UNK> seemed rather quaint if not downright <UNK>
<START> i think the best of times was a lost cause from the get go the initial premise guy drops the winning <UNK> pass against a rival high school team can never seem to get over it and then tries to reunite the two teams to play again is one of the dumbest i have ever heard since ron <UNK> went on to write much better sports films i wonder if there was more to it then that i hope this film wasn't green lit with <UNK> <UNK> the story as i wrote above br br so we have the premise going from there you would think or hope that there might be a few twists along the way to keep things lively no such luck this script follows every predictable cliché you can think of there isn't a moment in this film you won't see coming a mile away before the film reveals it and the ending well if you can't figure out the ending by the end of the first reel then you haven't paid attention or seen any other sports movie in your life br br robin williams and kurt russell star and bore in the leads williams is the poor <UNK> who dropped the big pass and russell is the <UNK> who threw the <UNK> pass gee do you think russell will suit up just once more to see if he and williams can right a wrong that the town has never forgotten this is such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck script that one can only shake their heads wondering what might have been sure there are a few chuckles and to be honest there is one truly funny scene williams and russell have marital problems and the wives invite them over for dinner to resolve things neither guy realizes that they have been invited over on a monday and yes monday night football is on keeping in mind that the two teams playing have a combined one victory the men williams especially try to resist the temptation to find out how the game is going the scene <UNK> into some hilarious bits as williams goes to check the score by using a bathroom visit as a <UNK> when he returns he <UNK> the score to russell later as russell is starting to make the moves on his wife williams <UNK> the television into their view from another room br br it's an inspired and funny scene in a mostly uninspired and stupid movie
<START> a christmas story is one of many people's all time most beloved films <UNK> was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have it had a <UNK> and <UNK> to it that is rare br br so i <UNK> and <UNK> its sequel it runs in the family the film was almost released a couple of times only to be pulled at the last minute when it finally came out <UNK> was and is i guess a total failure br br the sets and cinematography were just fine but the directing totally completely missed the mark the film was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting lazy writing and <UNK> acting br br the narrator jean shepard who was one of america's great <UNK> and story <UNK> forced upon us a false <UNK> of the warm wit he used in <UNK> he over <UNK> and why he did that i'll never know he somehow managed to become an annoying overwrought parody of himself br br the writing and acting in <UNK> is <UNK> and forced the actors may have seen <UNK> but whatever wit and nuance that was in <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> at all on any of them the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and <UNK> of any of <UNK> dry humor br br <UNK> will always be a real treasure but to call <UNK> a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and <UNK>
<START> i saw this film 12 years ago on <UNK> it was <UNK> <UNK> birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones 1963 i have not seen this film on tv since i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim <UNK> as <UNK> the sailor i believe that <UNK> now does the narration of the harry potter books on <UNK> but anyway he is quite funny this is a fast paced comedy it is not on vhs or dvd columbia pictures should go through their film collection and consider <UNK> and releasing this film to dvd christopher plummer is hilarious as lord <UNK> ian <UNK> is also quite humorous as <UNK> the sailor this is a <UNK> comedy the kind of film one no longer sees with great production values 1 2 stars out of
<START> a <UNK> in the life of one of the first female <UNK> to achieve historical <UNK> artemisia tells the true story of a young italian woman's <UNK> pursuit of artistic expression and the <UNK> she encounters the film features <UNK> <UNK> and sets and a good cast and acting however it is muddled in its attempt to depict the <UNK> of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on <UNK> and explored through her <UNK> with men a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films
<START> this is my favorite of the three care bears movies once again i liked all the songs the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story <UNK> the original for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their cousins who they apparently never knew about it wasn't of course until the end that the cousins received their <UNK> symbols after proving how much they cared in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have <UNK> symbols all along that being said this isn't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first i thought the <UNK> character much more evil then the nicholas of the first but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the <UNK> of the care bears i also liked the we care part at the end although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene and of course i loved the songs my favorites being growing up and forever young the care bears movies have always had such good songs ten stars for a very good movie
<START> one of the best films i have seen in the past five years the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and <UNK> on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being <UNK> in the making funny charming sad and inspiring this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry <UNK> often nauseating <UNK> in the <UNK> where it belongs although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing so don't miss it
<START> this film is being described as a comedy but it wasn't a comedy at all like any <UNK> film it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social <UNK> and <UNK> but it was very funny much lighter than the director's dark and serious the circle my favourite iranian film the <UNK> of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable as if it were a documentary and completely hilarious br br the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing it added a realism much like <UNK> kenny of course a very different film br br the performances from all the non professional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible it was very moving to see the passion disappointment and excitement of these girls anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a <UNK> are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eye opener br br to me the soldiers represented the current <UNK> they started out with stock standard official policy <UNK> to all the <UNK> of the girls as the film progressed they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance when what seems like all of <UNK> breaks out into wild celebration everyone is caught up in it and the <UNK> of the current <UNK> is obvious to one and all br br it was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions <UNK> drama and social commentary though it's adult cinema i think mature minded children from about seven <UNK> would really appreciate this film as long as they can read subtitles br br it is remarkable that a <UNK> country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of <UNK> and <UNK> perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely <UNK> australian and other film makers could take a <UNK> out of their book
<START> a warm touching movie that has a fantasy like quality br br ellen <UNK> is as always superb br br samantha <UNK> has given many great performances but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory br br most of all you've got to see this amazing 5 <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> i was so captivated by her presence i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again she is a miracle of god's creation br br judging by the high imdb rating i'm not the only one who was <UNK> by this young actress
<START> richard dreyfuss is indeed in this flick but in a rather small part he is not the obsessed filmmaker he's the <UNK> business manager <UNK> even the box describes the film <UNK> there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke as advertised unless one uses the term erotic quite loosely i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character i might have however had i realized that the famous 60's <UNK> leonard <UNK> suzanne was an artistic influence other than the brief <UNK> of lines from the end of james <UNK> <UNK> and an interesting visual reference to the end of <UNK> <UNK> the seventh seal i found it a poor attempt to <UNK> symbolic elements and <UNK> <UNK> in films like last year at <UNK> and un <UNK> <UNK> if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic <UNK> there are many superior films ranging from bye bye <UNK> to cecil b demented
<START> as a long time fan of all the star trek series i found this a disappointing episode and i wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring will <UNK> exploits both positive and largely romantic and negative lots of pain and a <UNK> death was a money saving device as were many of their bottle shows episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise diana <UNK> who also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character dr kate <UNK> loyal viewers in the star trek world is there any other kind also were <UNK> this was the last episode of second season thus the season ended not with a bang but with a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> talent i continued to watch i can safely say i'm now glad that i did the story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most don't have any information missing br br the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and <UNK> possessed by the character <UNK> br br some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line here's to hoping for another season
<START> this is a terrible production of <UNK> though not as the other reviewer put it because it is <UNK> but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book it tells the story almost painfully so watching it i could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation rather see the 2001 version of <UNK> featuring <UNK> glover that version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel what's important is the spirit not the <UNK> of things like setting character names and costumes the difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mind numbing schlock
<START> as has been stated countless times the hills have eyes 2 is not a remake of the generally <UNK> mid '80s sequel to wes craven's 1977 original but wishing to give this <UNK> sequel to a remake the official <UNK> of <UNK> returns craven himself a double threat alongside his son jonathan has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality in plain english horrible former music video director martin <UNK> takes the <UNK> from alexandre <UNK> and is clearly in way over his head yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the <UNK> screen writing 101 <UNK> not only are the characters in this case a gang of <UNK> national guards <UNK> men sent to investigate the <UNK> hills of the original remake completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre <UNK> played without a <UNK> of irony mind you but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny after viewing their total <UNK> during a training exercise their fate against the repulsive <UNK> cannibals is painfully obvious only this time out as in the original '80s sequel the script is so simplistic barely existent actually that any potential subtext is <UNK> in favor of <UNK> the <UNK> in repulsive shocks we're treated to a <UNK> <UNK> murder during the opening credits plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't <UNK> the dvd by the <UNK> even the mutants in this outing are personality free freaks of no memorable stature the tacky <UNK> looking makeup fx seems like the rest of the film to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment i really <UNK> at the lame <UNK> at the end of <UNK> otherwise excellent film and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of hills 2 setting the stage very <UNK> setting the stage for a third installment yet the <UNK> and <UNK> have created a film that is such a cynical <UNK> of what made the 1977 2006 versions work that they'd be hard pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face
<START> just a comment on new orleans accents br br an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like <UNK> than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer br br many people in new orleans do in fact sound <UNK> i have never found out why it's mentioned in a <UNK> of <UNK> by john kennedy <UNK> i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often it's just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent
<START> there just isn't enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd br br the whole time i was watching it i was thinking <UNK> i could do better than that and i'm a moron don't believe the few good reviews i was <UNK> in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn't deliver on it maybe if they <UNK> it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren't the best but they just didn't have much with which to work this movie failed because of <UNK> writing sorely disappointed
<START> to be honest i knew what to expect before i watched this film and i've got to say it has the worst acting i've ever seen it does have its moments and on a comedy level its very entertaining but i'm afraid its not scary and stupidity is taken to a new level there's a lot of unnecessary gore and the plot is all over the place i have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they even came to this remote part of <UNK> i mean who'd go there anyway but i didn't care at that point because i was amused by the costumes and the bad cgi as far as b movies go this deserves the title of <UNK> so bad its <UNK> and kudos to the film makers because they probably knew what they were doing long may these films continue
<START> here's yet another <UNK> european story in which they blast the religion of their country these <UNK> filmmakers are relentless here we see a brutal <UNK> of <UNK> and or the catholic <UNK> and i am not catholic br br this won actually won an academy award for <UNK> foreign film that's probably because the story made <UNK> and religious belief in general look extremely weak one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else he's portrayed as nothing but an idiot no wonder the <UNK> dominated academy loved this movie br br also there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who <UNK> his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story the daughters take turns <UNK> the <UNK> student who states he studied for six years but says he's an <UNK> i mean how <UNK> is this film br br this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the film business worldwide not just hollywood
<START> this movie is an abomination and its making should have been considered a capital crime br br one of the great mysteries of film making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery it is a tale of a really gripping mystery nice old fashioned romance and dry english humor why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of <UNK> struggle to save the accused etc etc these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product
<START> i shouldn't even review this movie since it's not actually a horror movie and thus not worthy of dr <UNK> attention at least it's not horror in the usual sense it's certainly a horrifying <UNK> to waste your time watching this crap that's why i turned it off after the first four hours imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed yep that's right in plain terms this movie is b o r i n g br br the order had lots of flaws not all of them unique in particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious <UNK> of horror films is hollywood's <UNK> to engage christianity on its own terms it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also <UNK> just ask william peter <UNK> in fact without <UNK> films like this are just an anything goes <UNK> of the <UNK> usually dull and illogical <UNK> br br think about it if someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot the same goes for these sorts of movies br br in other words the order and many similar movies before it <UNK> out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these <UNK> <UNK> the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your <UNK> growing br br avoid this steaming pile
<START> the waiting <UNK> ward of a large lying in hospital with all its <UNK> and <UNK> is the place where life begins br br this nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera <UNK> with comedy and tragedy all tied into the lives of the <UNK> staff and their patients the <UNK> with which the subject matter is handled points up the movie's pre code status br br marvelous <UNK> <UNK> as the sympathetic head nurse is the calm center of the film the rock around which all the <UNK> flow able to handle any crisis or <UNK> she is the <UNK> best sometimes last friend surrounding <UNK> is a <UNK> of excellent <UNK> loretta young as a convicted <UNK> released from prison long enough to give birth eric <UNK> as her frightened young husband <UNK> glenda farrell as a dame who hates children sweet clara <UNK> as a very mature mother in for her sixth <UNK> preston foster hale hamilton as thoughtful compassionate doctors and frank <UNK> as a <UNK> frantic father to be br br movie <UNK> will recognize <UNK> watson as a wee <UNK> who wants to see the <UNK> paul fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a little soldier ' gilbert <UNK> as a <UNK> italian husband and elizabeth <UNK> as a <UNK> doctor's wife interested in <UNK> <UNK> son all uncredited br br there are a few <UNK> in the plot some of the mothers are obviously much too old farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the ward but none of the staff seem to notice an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious
<START> i haven't seen all of jess <UNK> movies i have seen 5 i think and there are more than <UNK> of them so maybe it's a bit early to say so but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> better known as <UNK> but that is the cut version is according to me if not the best certainly on of <UNK> best franco is best known although <UNK> might be slightly exaggerated for <UNK> <UNK> a weird <UNK> movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jess franco is an overwhelming director when the phone <UNK> during <UNK> i let it ring i just wanted to see more of the movie since that moment franco never could grip me that much but then i stumbled on this movie it is even better than <UNK> <UNK> i think franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera we find out he can do a lot i certainly didn't expect to find <UNK> that great its beginning didn't impress me at all remember i had seen <UNK> <UNK> before although <UNK> that came only three years later and both movies kinda start the same but then the story went on puzzling and gripping beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he weren't so occupied with <UNK> his political messages later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn't old fashioned the man says that all movies have to be old fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed but the girl replies that <UNK> fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow <UNK> <UNK> is an interesting lead actress and of course howard <UNK> a franco regular is also there luckily the acting is good something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you but not this one but certainly watch out for the <UNK> scene the erotic tension the wild directing and the fact that it's a <UNK> movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see the fact that it is a bit more accessible than <UNK> <UNK> certainly helps
<START> yes this gets the full ten stars it's plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent <UNK> harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true <UNK> glory that you just can't fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that <UNK> story the other two steps in the trilogy do <UNK> the story with sean penn and <UNK> glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the <UNK> is <UNK> by the retelling giving us a <UNK> glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone
<START> this british film is truly awful and it's hard to believe that glenn ford is in it although he pretty much <UNK> through it the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good but it turns out this train ends up <UNK> for the majority of the film no action no movement just a static train the area where the train is <UNK> is <UNK> so it's not like there's any danger to anyone either in fact this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don't a fact apparently unknown to the director spoiler the train actually has two bombs on it but we are led to believe there is only one after the first bomb is <UNK> it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more but at the last minute the villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals there are two nor are we certain when the bombs will go off so we don't even have a classic <UNK> bomb tension sequence a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn ford's french wife thinking about leaving him and then wondering where he is she's such an annoying character that we don't care whether she <UNK> with him so when she does there's nothing emotional about it most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality and none have any problems or issues it's only <UNK> minutes but it feels long because it's tedious and dull don't waste your time
<START> you can be fooled by your first impressions as in initial reactions to a movie for example as in the first time i saw this movie i was <UNK> by the idea of it first of all i love black comedies could even despite being male myself <UNK> with the <UNK> girls' <UNK> to see their husbands deceased without <UNK> was <UNK> up by my own face value and i do mean face value response to <UNK> sheridan and a couple of the other delicious <UNK> in the picture it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad and not bad good either the reason i'm giving this movie a 4 rating is because of ms sheridan and her <UNK> the rest of <UNK> is pretty good too but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it i don't think it's a total waste of time but
<START> this movie stinks the <UNK> resembles bad <UNK> that sat in the sun too long i can't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film <UNK>
<START> the film version of alice <UNK> hugely <UNK> and influential 1983 novel written largely as letters from the central character <UNK> to god was a massive oscar success and rightly so br br in the role of the abused and <UNK> <UNK> whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah <UNK> as <UNK> the fiery woman <UNK> by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert <UNK> abusive husband margaret <UNK> as <UNK> a force of change for the good <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> dawn chong as <UNK> and <UNK> susan <UNK> as <UNK> the <UNK> wife and the much missed carl anderson otherwise best known as <UNK> in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar as preacher samuel br br beautifully paced and <UNK> written 'the color <UNK> does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature length drama
<START> first let me state that i am a big fan of ashley judd that's why i was curious to check out this her debut role no argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent i guess i can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story however i like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails br br by the halfway point i found myself thinking how much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl <UNK> standing around a deserted <UNK> shop <UNK> the <UNK> it seemed to go on forever br br then i thought maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to <UNK> the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event no such luck the movie continues it's bland boring <UNK> story all the way to the end br br i'm not saying this because i'm an action <UNK> i like all kinds of movies especially romantic comedies but i expect to be entertained br br add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your <UNK> bad home movies depressing br br i just don't get how anyone could like this movie zero entertainment value the longest <UNK> minutes of my life br br
<START> i don't understand people why is it that this movie is getting an 8 3 i had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen or of the summer year etc they say it's an excellent conclusion wtf what has been <UNK> besides the fact that bourne can ride <UNK> shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across what do you learn about <UNK> character in this movie absolutely f nothing okay there's a lot of action but what's so great about the action in this movie i don't like the cinematography and film editing the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast i didn't mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess and made me quite <UNK> i was quickly wishing i had saved my for something else br br this movie has no plot all this movie is is a <UNK> minute chase seen bourne who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire <UNK> minutes of the movie is a <UNK> at everything he attempts there is absolutely no character development in this movie you know nothing about anyone and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense what writing what suspense there's no suspense bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does i don't think he has anything to worry about if this is the best movie of the year 2007 i may just quit watching movies entirely br br many people have also said that matt <UNK> performance in this movie is one of the best if not the best of his career what performance how many lines did he have in this movie i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next someone who chooses different types of roles not someone who plays the same roles over and over again which damon doesn't do but an example of someone who does is <UNK> <UNK> br br anyways this movie was a big disappointment to me i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two bourne identity and bourne supremacy and i most definitely recommend reading the three books which are much different then the movies
<START> this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't <UNK> fit any mold it's horror but not a <UNK> it's equal part suspense as well as horror yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera br br the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters br br forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe that's a red <UNK> he is acting here <UNK> is a <UNK> of the tone of this story <UNK> <UNK> is giving a rock solid performance so she must believe the script has something to say we all know the sorry excuses where the actors <UNK> don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap cut and get their <UNK> this is not the case here br br forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost <UNK> funny <UNK> i don't think the intent was humorous but to keep you off balance br br think of it less of a horror <UNK> and more of a horror <UNK> on a stage that <UNK> <UNK> house then you might see it's really about paranoia fear and <UNK> madness set in an isolated <UNK> usa br br and it is <UNK> time travel mind control secret experiments and <UNK> who may not be dead yet br br i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down
<START> the <UNK> that <UNK> on this film are well known for their claim to take the <UNK> of the bible without any <UNK> or extra biblical influence the existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing br br if you want to know what the born again branch of christianity were <UNK> on about in the seventies just look up the word <UNK> in a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> it's <UNK> than sitting through this waste of celluloid br br poor acting uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick paranoid christian conspiracy <UNK> for those not familiar with the <UNK> scene you could not really put this into the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category so its only audience are either those with a <UNK> collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid
<START> people who actually liked problem child 1990 need to have their heads examined who would take the idea of watching a <UNK> little boy <UNK> havoc on others and <UNK> it funny the movie is not funny ever in any way beginning to end it wants to be a cartoon but the writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people get attacked by bears or hit with baseball bats it may be funny in cartoons but not in a motion picture br br the film's young hero is junior michael oliver who since he was a baby has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for <UNK> the families reject him because junior tends to give them a hard time br br he is then thrown into an <UNK> where he <UNK> the nuns and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow tie killer michael richards he is soon adopted by ben and <UNK> <UNK> the late john ritter and his wife amy <UNK> who are dying to have a child in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood br br junior becomes a member of the <UNK> household and little ben takes an interest in him despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by <UNK> a bear onto the site or throws a cat at his father big ben jack warden a <UNK> politician br br i think that we're supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people his new mother <UNK> is a bitch his grandfather is completely selfish and one little girl who <UNK> adopted kids is such a spoiled brat br br but what junior does to get the last laughs isn't funny it's mean cruel and sometimes life threatening br br and what is the film's message that kids should resolve problems with violence and <UNK> that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers they definitely don't what it's like to be a bad kid junior isn't a one he's just a sadistic little <UNK> there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others now everybody's laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat br br it's a shame that this movie has been <UNK> as a family comedy what's worse is that problem child is rated pg what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this there's a lot of profanity and mean spirited pranks here that one may wonder about the <UNK> between the pg and the pg 13 br br kids will enjoy this but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen and to most people problem child will be considered a guilty pleasure classic a film that someone will <UNK> admit to liking even though the <UNK> opinion as put forth by more serious viewers is that the movie is a piece of crap
<START> saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife who produced it took a q a afterwards br br i found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a <UNK> for a script he liked br br certainly reminiscent of cinema <UNK> it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba however don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous many references to the directors obvious love of film history a great <UNK> thief homage and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious br br enjoy
<START> remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory br br while hollywood homicide is by no means terrible it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie it's a comedy that's not particularly funny and an action movie that's not especially exciting an <UNK> of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline br br ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects and he is able to carry the film most of the time <UNK> is adequate but he and ford aren't exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concerned br br all in all hollywood homicide is a reasonably amusing <UNK> but just barely take out ford and it's not even that
<START> this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever i had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years until i saw an add on tv for <UNK> and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie usually i don't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie br br the ending of the movie always touches my heart and <UNK> me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today i mean the movie is g rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling there is a lot of smoking drinking murder death and hell depicted in the movie which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today don't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did br br rip <UNK> <UNK> dom <UNK>
<START> i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed <UNK> the <UNK> sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor darth <UNK> he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the <UNK> <UNK> his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the <UNK> of the rebel battle ships and all <UNK> war ships and super star <UNK> i loved the new race they brought on screen the <UNK> <UNK> the ewoks the <UNK> <UNK> co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film 1 when vader destroys the emperor and is <UNK> wounded 2 when luke sees the spirits of <UNK> wan and <UNK> and then it shows up <UNK> skywalker sebastian shaw the greatest scene in star wars 3 when leia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> crime lord br br i personally like the script and the battle of <UNK> presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v s luke skywalker on the death star post script the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 9 10
<START> a sophisticated contemporary fable about the <UNK> that work to <UNK> and ultimately <UNK> the <UNK> of marriage the main thrust of the narrative <UNK> from a <UNK> spoken by a country priest following the wedding <UNK> of a young <UNK> couple from <UNK> in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit <UNK> from the <UNK> of modern life the <UNK> of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be <UNK> by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards it's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs
<START> there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival it is dull plodding and lacking in suspense br br peter <UNK> <UNK> performance and the appearance of playwright harold <UNK> are the only elements of interest br br note some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson best known for his portrayal of inspector <UNK> in the <UNK> television series in one of his earliest roles
<START> after a slow beginning bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say it wasn't one of jim <UNK> best performances but he was still ok morgan freeman was just right as god jennifer aniston had some good moments i miss steve <UNK> on the daily show br br i like director tom <UNK> choices of movies he also did liar liar <UNK> adams and the nutty professor in all three of those and in bruce almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him a director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find br br my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie my guess is that the first few <UNK> of the screenplay had more biblical references but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of <UNK> people that's too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity br br my grade br br 7 out of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city i was younger then but it was an excellent play so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it and why michael douglas he didnt suit the role this movie really sucked big time br br my advise is not to rent this movie save your money for something better like cats
<START> thank g d it bombed or we might get treated to such <UNK> as <UNK> fu where we can see the likes of brian <UNK> performing a triple <UNK> <UNK> bad guys to <UNK> with his razor sharp <UNK> but i <UNK> one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t a from ms <UNK> it's not like the world would have seen anything new at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread i truly believe that porn would have suited her <UNK> much better although <UNK> hepburn couldn't have stayed <UNK> in this <UNK> one explanation for kurt <UNK> presence could be a traumatic brain injury possibly from coming up short too often on <UNK> it's a good thing the <UNK> wasn't as <UNK> on <UNK> as they are now or kurt would surely have been stripped of his <UNK> to be avoided at all costs
<START> the real shame of the gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the <UNK> shallow plot the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction <UNK> i would love to see laurel <UNK> in a room with susan <UNK> even for just five minutes she has that sarcasm that wit that double edged personality that is at once <UNK> and lovable sadly though the <UNK> 5 pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination patricia <UNK> who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as <UNK> alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome <UNK> i shall leave you with one final thought why is it that <UNK> looks like some sort of outer space frog man even though she is a woman thank heavens for the way the <UNK> looked later in the show
<START> i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if <UNK> black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly <UNK> has brought the series down in my <UNK> to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben <UNK> to replace <UNK> was a mistake br br unfortunately we were just <UNK> from the loss of <UNK> and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of <UNK> br br i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had <UNK> that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
<START> this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early 1950s this <UNK> and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars richard widmark jean peters and richard <UNK> star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of america and they'll stop at nothing to succeed br br the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents they know she is a link in a long espionage chain unknown to everyone is the wild card in the <UNK> a small time <UNK> widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying widmark thinks it's just another purse he's <UNK> only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen now it's widmark on his own with <UNK> and the fbi hot on his trail br br widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish although she didn't get top billing a special mention should be made of thelma ritter this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a <UNK> <UNK> seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady br br as far as the script and directing go they are very good but with one small exception at first i loved the way widmark and peters <UNK> it's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman <UNK> square in the mouth now that's tough later inexplicably they become amazingly close too close to be believable still with so much great drama and such an effective noir like film this can be overlooked see this film
<START> <UNK> from germany and i love the <UNK> i go 200 times a year tonight i saw pecker it was a wonderful evening thank you mr waters everybody who has a chance to see the movie go
<START> i remember watching the disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch plenty of other <UNK> ever after put aside of cinderella have in fact lost their touch throughout the years then i found this production with a flawless performance by kathleen turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the <UNK> essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood br br we all know the story of cinderella a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and <UNK> and <UNK> to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella whose real name is <UNK> and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery to be trapped in a situation of her father who still lives slowly losing himself to a <UNK> wife who <UNK> him into playing favorites with his wife and step daughters against his own and tries to poison him thus <UNK> goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another <UNK> at the ball by distracting the men who come her way there the bored prince <UNK> has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress <UNK> by a water <UNK> named <UNK> with rose <UNK> for <UNK> br br what drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to it does not <UNK> a web of lies like most cinderella stories it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did instead it shows more of <UNK> <UNK> heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning the costumes are all beautifully made especially <UNK> <UNK> blue <UNK> to match the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beauty and soft spirit like voice br br i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting twist my only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other fairy tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print
<START> i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual <UNK> force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are <UNK> and humorous you feel like you're in on a secret and <UNK> your head at the same time because it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from 60's present day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the <UNK> movement politics and good <UNK> history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed what's in all 4 segments so just wanted to be safe
<START> first off i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr <UNK> mouth his matter of fact delivery of interesting <UNK> is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus he comes across likable <UNK> <UNK> he doesn't <UNK> to the current political style obnoxious <UNK> <UNK> and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right <UNK> both and for good reason br br unfortunately the film itself is a dud in fact i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches watching rebel without a pause is no different from watching a <UNK> on a <UNK> taped segment on <UNK> there are no camera movements no edits no <UNK> touches there is no story no narrative br br technically speaking the production is strictly amateurish audio is terrible and inconsistent sometimes we cannot hear noam speak other times we cannot hear the questions that are being <UNK> by those in <UNK> when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently <UNK> every one of his speeches and <UNK> with pride every time we see her br br i cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on <UNK> or cd to listen to in the car br br 4 out of 10 stars and i'm in a generous mood today
<START> i watch them all br br it's not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but it's completely respectable and <UNK> different in parts br br i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather <UNK> for example the name should scream don't watch <UNK> she move ' since when can movie titles ignore <UNK> br br there is nothing <UNK> incorrect about <UNK> english <UNK> it's just not canadian standard english <UNK> comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because i'm a canadian standard english <UNK> so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different <UNK> as the other step movies i have seen were so american br br i loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so <UNK> cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies br br in summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have <UNK> issues about the <UNK> of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
<START> and a made for tv movie too this movie was good the acting in it and the plot was just so great this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt <UNK> my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of <UNK> coming to kill me through my computer screen there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie but it's very easily over looked br br antonio <UNK> jr did an excellent role in this movie along with <UNK> turner and robert wagner this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on four times and it too kicked was great if you ever see this movie come on tv i'd watch it the effects in this movie were pretty well done i honestly don't know what a live <UNK> human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad br br watch it it's really good no really it is
<START> i'm too old to know or care exactly what the difference between rap and hip hop is and being canadian it's likely that i've never actually seen mtv but i'm not certain br br but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it a bright little satire hip hop culture is so <UNK> these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over if only we could say the same about <UNK> music i got most of the jokes at least i think i did sure it's derived from spinal tap but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment just not the <UNK> they're sacred
<START> it's not a terrible movie really and glenn and keitel are top notch actors further they do an acceptable job with the very weak script the scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists further i <UNK> why these actors and the crew made the film they are professionals and they get paid for it but i do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences even if a film is a box office flop surely it makes some money if you are a fan of keitel or glenn rent the video or catch it on tv as did i granted the movie won't help solve the <UNK> <UNK> with mexico but the experience is far better than 90 of the standard tv fare of today
<START> perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it's not it's certainly one of those who are burned onto your <UNK> as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork first there is the director's touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen tony montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people's living rooms there are the many superb one liners count how many times the word f <UNK> is used there are the superb little details the pan american globe that screams the world is yours or the great <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> nothing can be named that isn't sublime here and it easily is along with the godfather good <UNK> and white heat one of the best <UNK> ever made
<START> i like brad pitt enormously he is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face <UNK> and all the rest since i saw him in thelma and louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of <UNK> did it for me he is the new <UNK> <UNK> the differences are obvious of course male american etc but <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind nonetheless he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it kalifornia 12 monkeys fight club snatch his self <UNK> humor makes him human almost accessible fortunately <UNK> will soon be forgotten only still photographs with pitt semi naked in ravishing <UNK> positions will <UNK> the walls of <UNK> of <UNK> fans strange <UNK> boot is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century what is <UNK> <UNK> doing directing this well i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new <UNK> <UNK>
<START> yet another venture into the realm of the teen gross out comedy set on a college campus featuring a <UNK> quest to <UNK> and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular <UNK> into making him get the girl it's all been done before and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner the gross out humor that has made teen flicks like american pie and dude where's my car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only <UNK> and <UNK> the film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable i won't even <UNK> this terrible picture by <UNK> as it's a waste of my time and yours at best <UNK> never manages to entertain or <UNK> laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable br br jason <UNK> who impressed in his debut <UNK> <UNK> himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast please avoid please avoid save your money
<START> i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd br br james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip <UNK> a <UNK> and dedicated fbi agent his life in the <UNK> is <UNK> with his family life which is not all <UNK> his wife an excellent portrayal by vera miles lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and they even separate for a time <UNK> best friend and fellow agent sam <UNK> murray hamilton is killed in a <UNK> <UNK> son mike <UNK> in the marines during world war ii through it all the family carries on with bravery and dignity br br the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi documentary style of the film works effectively and the music by max <UNK> says it all <UNK> bravery and integrity br br this country owes a great debt of <UNK> to the men and women of the fbi and yes to j edgar hoover as well if mr <UNK> type of <UNK> had been observed we might have been <UNK> 9 11 the <UNK> in crimes against children and many of the <UNK> politicians we've had to put up with since his passing
<START> boring badly written italian exploitation flick lots of nudity gore and awful acting the werewolf makeup was the only thing that would raise a laugh complete rubbish even for fans of cheesy italian horror please avoid
<START> mike brady michael garfield who had a <UNK> part in the classic the warriors is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town not just any slugs mind you but <UNK> killer bigger then normal mutated by toxic waste slugs who still only go as fast as a normal slug which isn't that frightening but i <UNK> no one will believe him at first but they will oh yes they will br br ok killer slugs are right above psychotic <UNK> and right below <UNK> winters as <UNK> baby in the creepiness factor so the <UNK> of it all is quite apparent from the get go the flick is fun somewhat through and is of the <UNK> bad that it's <UNK> variety i appreciate that they spelled out that this was slugs the movie as opposed to slugs the children's game or slugs the other white meat probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game director juan <UNK> <UNK> is more widely known for his previous films <UNK> people which mst3k deservedly <UNK> and <UNK> which is quite possibly the <UNK> bad movie ever made br br eye candy <UNK> rose shows t a br br my grade d br br dvd extras merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
<START> i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy brosnan is genius as anyone will now <UNK> he is not to be <UNK> in the bond role kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie what an unexpected pleasure my favourite line would be 'i feel like a <UNK> hooker on a sunday after the navy left <UNK> brosnan delivered this very un bond line with such unexpected comedic <UNK> i was also very impressed with hope <UNK> performance it seems like everyone in this movie <UNK> out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man' you will definitely like this br br i voted 10
<START> i'm gonna tip the <UNK> here a bit and say i enjoyed this however the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very <UNK> <UNK> it's definitely something that most people will not get as is the nature of <UNK> br br the animation is horrible but yes that's the point the main character is foul mouthed violent and stupid no redeeming qualities whatsoever his wife <UNK> and <UNK> apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills most of these stories completely lack any kind of point br br but again that's the point br br if non <UNK> foul language and complete and utter <UNK> are your thing you're going to love this br br it is really short so i would probably rent instead of buying
<START> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> funny spoof of the music video business might have been the perfect comedic short and stars john cusack and tim robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved they play two semi <UNK> security guards in los angeles who start their own company video <UNK> making hilarious videos for groups parties and one <UNK> star it's too bad the filmmakers had to <UNK> a dim side plot to pad the running time <UNK> involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength sending up the music culture of the late '80s still cusack and robbins create a couple of originals here nerdy but loose street smart without being <UNK> or <UNK> these guys are on the same nutty <UNK> and they never put each other down they're the real thing in buddy comedies 1 2 from
<START> from watching only the trailer to theodore rex you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with whoopi goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume that is true but this is mostly a futuristic story which looks a lot like batman forever with it's direction style and weird character designs it was <UNK> and should have been <UNK> as a futuristic tale instead of just a lame cop comedy whether or not this movie is <UNK> it's still a horrible movie br br in the future dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology and they talk and walk around like humans teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously but after a dinosaur is murdered he's given the case to work on but he has to be partners with the <UNK> cop of them all katie <UNK> whoopi goldberg it's up to this <UNK> duo to solve the murder and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of <UNK> br br teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character but by the end he is unbearable to listen to for some reason along with being a detective he's also a bad comedian and a bad <UNK> he does <UNK> of famous people and accents and has some truly awful lines whoopi blames him for <UNK> and he says it's not my butt <UNK> wow what a <UNK> immature line even for a kid's movie of this caliber whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone i was hoping teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film br br this movie never knew what it wanted to be when the futuristic scenes and action occur there is no comedy or humor in any non action scenes the characters try to be as funny as they can which just results in <UNK> straight faced <UNK> the action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough and as stated earlier the comedy is just a bunch of <UNK> jokes nothing ever works here br br having a dinosaur human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie if nothing else nope this movie is a huge rip off of who framed roger rabbit just replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future and it's the exact same plot a man is killed a dinosaur is killed a dinosaur and detective solve the murder a <UNK> and detective solve the murder the bad guys in roger rabbit are christopher lloyd and <UNK> the bad guys here are a guy who sounds like christopher lloyd and guys who act just like the <UNK> the club scene in roger rabbit where jessica rabbit walks down the stage is <UNK> with dinosaurs this is a huge rip off of a much better movie br br overall this is a bad movie not even deserving of it's straight to vhs stature br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg for mild violence language and crude humor
<START> we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to <UNK> about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite
<START> pecker is another mainstream film by john waters done on a smaller than serial mom the title character of pecker has a <UNK> of taking pictures of anything he sees it doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when he takes pictures he soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work pecker live in a semi normal middle class family his dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street his mom runs a <UNK> shop and loves to dress up poor people his older sister tina works at a gay bar where her <UNK> is trade his younger little <UNK> has a habit of eating sugar sugar and nothing but <UNK> food his grandmother <UNK> has a small statue of the virgin mary and plays <UNK> with it he also has 2 friends on of his friends matt is a <UNK> <UNK> and his girlfriend shelley runs a <UNK> <UNK> as if she was a dictator soon a tourist from new york buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery with the picture comes fame but the pictures expose the unusual life style of his friends and family's simple life for an r rated film pecker is sure <UNK> than most of waters previous r rated films and even pink <UNK> another 10 out of 10
<START> there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating <UNK> is one of them this film shows it as it is it is not <UNK> for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the <UNK> to stop this is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not <UNK> things that are wrong
<START> from the <UNK> <UNK> footage to the acting that makes keanu i'm so wooden i could be a <UNK> me reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites pun not intended the best thing about it is the box of <UNK> in the 2nd segment which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and <UNK> wish i'd spent the <UNK> 99 it cost me on something else like <UNK> natural born killers directors cut if you do buy this you're really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague if you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a <UNK> then go ahead however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere like dog soldiers <UNK> <UNK> the werewolf hunt
<START> maybe i need to have my head examined but i thought this was a pretty good movie the cg is not too bad i have seen worse the look of the creatures and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake was pretty cool the action scenes involving the snakes was really good i thought there are some <UNK> in logic at times and the story doesn't always make sense but for a creature feature there are a lot worse a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies so it's not wholly original i think the <UNK> of the story is original though there is a bit of similarity to godzilla the big budget american version which liked a lot i didn't like this movie as much but i still say it was pretty good i also liked the music all in all i think dragon wars is about a 7 10
<START> <UNK> is part of a new wave of japanese cinema taking very creative directors <UNK> and <UNK> and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces <UNK> is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing brilliant even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a <UNK> at traditional beliefs in <UNK> demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in <UNK> samurai epics or the <UNK> series another fine example of this genre is <UNK> 2001 i would place director <UNK> <UNK> as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include <UNK> twilight samurai 2002 and <UNK> <UNK> zatoichi the blind <UNK> 2003
<START> following the success of paris je t'aime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly by the time you think are getting into a story it's over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin again with the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less <UNK> in structure br br sadly however while paris je t'aime was hit or miss mostly hit most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet and often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my <UNK> among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the <UNK> old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much and i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much br br by the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture br br also if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool <UNK> eating a <UNK> and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film <UNK> the world including a very unhappy couple
<START> the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the <UNK> innocent pecker played <UNK> by edward <UNK> who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include <UNK> friend matt he's a thief but he's really a nice guy <UNK> sister <UNK> who is addicted to sugar and <UNK> catholic grandmother who discovers life in a <UNK> of the virgin mary in her room br br the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many <UNK> to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy handed about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of <UNK> into a kind of reverse <UNK> than <UNK> but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject br br i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun
<START> this film was almost a great imaginative film a mixture of shakespeare pop jazz and <UNK> tales this movie was an imaginative twist on the cinderella theme featuring a strong cast headed by the perfectly cast kathleen turner this movie had everything going for it everything but production values i almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets but with an over the top production like this it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie besides better cinematography this film was almost perfect br br
<START> i wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night
<START> <UNK> <UNK> society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals why could your censors stomach a film where policemen <UNK> rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this <UNK> cops and gangsters story it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon br br should you see this film yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar <UNK> the insane ending in <UNK> of course great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as <UNK> <UNK> the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike <UNK> at a film festival is on dvd if i haven't put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i'm sure it will come out in that country
<START> the acting in this movie stinks the plot makes very little sense but from what i gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies or blow their heads up <UNK> and the effects are lousy too most of the movie consists of bad music with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes this should be one of the worst things ever made but for one thing one element of <UNK> brilliance that makes nightmare weekend stand above all others and that special quality is the presence of george br br george is the lovable <UNK> device between the <UNK> daughter jessica and the home computer security system with his green hair and nose <UNK> <UNK> and heart shaped mouth george is the guardian angel <UNK> to jessica who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid with his <UNK> <UNK> voice george tells jessica what <UNK> of males prefer women in white dresses and also that <UNK> <UNK> is the third best way to meet guys after <UNK> and bars of course little jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble causing george to <UNK> <UNK> program code protection jessica which results in the violent death of <UNK> would be <UNK> via one of the aforementioned steel balls br br kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise the light and sound show at the end of close encounters not bad but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet bishop data <UNK>  kitchen <UNK> next to the almighty george he might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 but don't be fooled this show is all about george with even that limited amount of <UNK> george joins the ranks of such <UNK> film characters as hollywood <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> from new moon rising as icons of american cinema george to <UNK>  you are my hero
<START> kudos to <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> the <UNK> movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very good it has the drama the action the romance and scene that will make you laugh br br while the story is not that original a love triangle or make a four <UNK> love japanese <UNK> rebellion american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> for the japanese and english for the american br br this movie will go as one of this year's best <UNK> movies br br go watch this
<START> hello mary lou prom night ii starts at the hamilton high school prom of 1957 where mary lou <UNK> lisa <UNK> is cheating on her date bill <UNK> steve <UNK> with bud cooper robert lewis bill finds out is <UNK> meanwhile mary lou is announced prom queen 1957 takes to the stage to accept her award bill still hurting decides to play a practical joke on mary lou so he throws a <UNK> on stage but the still lit <UNK> catches mary <UNK> dress setting it her on fire within seconds mary lou is <UNK> 30 years later hamilton high is soon to hold it's <UNK> prom night bill micheal <UNK> is now the principal has a teenage son named craig justin louis who is dating <UNK> carpenter wendy <UNK> are both planning on going to the prom together bud richard <UNK> is now a priest that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both bill bud one day <UNK> is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large <UNK> which she opens this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of mary lou is set free is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen in her spare time sets out to avenge her <UNK> death first up is jess <UNK> beth <UNK> whose death is put down to a suicide mary lou begins to <UNK> <UNK> body as the night of the prom draws <UNK> after <UNK> of some competition in the shape of kelly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who tries to fix the prom so she wins mary lou in <UNK> body is <UNK> hamilton high prom queen which allows mary lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance really <UNK> the party up br br with absolutely no connection to the original prom night 1980 directed by bruce <UNK> i thought hello mary lou prom night ii wasn't a particularly good film the script by ron oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations i suppose personally i found these different elements didn't really <UNK> or work that well together at all the whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where mary lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark then the film <UNK> along for another half an hour until <UNK> is finally possessed the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil mary lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd <UNK> not dead ready for a <UNK> ending didn't you don't expect a <UNK> body count just five throughout the entire film none particularly graphic although i did like the way monica <UNK> <UNK> as beverly <UNK> tried to hide in a shower room locker which mary lou crushed resulting in poor <UNK> blood <UNK> out the supernatural side of hello mary lou prom night ii is depicted by <UNK> having lots of hallucinations for the first hour mary lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a <UNK> horse which comes to life the <UNK> scene is quite good as well as it turns into water zombie hands drag <UNK> into it the slasher side of hello mary lou prom night ii isn't outstanding i did like mary lou herself as she <UNK> out the obligatory one liners she made for a good villain even if she didn't get to kill enough people oh yes i did get the running <UNK> to various other horror film director's with almost all of the character's sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose the acting is ok but the normally <UNK> micheal <UNK> looks lost <UNK> almost as if he's asking himself what he's doing in this if he'll ever work again forget about any gore someone is <UNK> there is a stabbing with a <UNK> that happens off screen someone is <UNK> with a <UNK> light a computer goes crazy <UNK> <UNK> face mary lou bursts out of <UNK> body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene there are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if that's your thing to give it some credit hello mary lou prom night ii is ok to watch has reasonable production values throughout is generally well made overall i was disappointed by hello mary lou prom night ii it was just too slow ultimately <UNK> to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes i'm not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating i'll give it a 4 as there's nothing specifically wrong with it i suppose i've sat through much worse films but it just didn't really do anything for me i'm afraid
<START> the best film about marriage and family this is a very interesting <UNK> to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and <UNK> fascinating world of marriage and family this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids the real <UNK> or help of <UNK> or <UNK> if we leave the real role of families they can help or they can destroy us the mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the <UNK> and the reality a couple who thinks in a <UNK> marriage live a painful story in their future own history br br who likes contract marriage nobody after the priest tells their own <UNK> if they leave the future in another hands if they don't know what is the marriage that the problems are true that the life demand a real engage <UNK> from each one that the real victims of the divorce are kids with real name <UNK> in the film or names that the abortion is only an easy exit sadness regrets and <UNK> will be there after abortion that the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families the <UNK> of the <UNK> the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of <UNK> because <UNK> lives his life as if he were alone br br maybe someone could think that this film is a <UNK> film but not <UNK> and <UNK> in the deep of their hearts they like a beautiful marriage and family if not why they like marriage a truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple of each one of their decisions of each one actions in their lives the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her only by existing the screenplay is wonderful the performances are great <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> almost cynical priest an excellent direction and script the colors and the management of the cameras superb
<START> most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing it isn't versus yes the cast and crew is basically the same yes <UNK> <UNK> a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half but that's about where the similarities end versus takes place essentially all outside <UNK> <UNK> ability to craft an interesting b movie in natural locations for alive almost everything takes place inside in small <UNK> spaces here the art design is thrust into your face and what art design it is we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film versus was all about action and cool here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind because of this alive is a far more interesting film than versus you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters br br i'm now <UNK> that i ordered the dvd despite some <UNK> you should too but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus it's often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it i hope media <UNK> picks it up for subtitled <UNK> dvd release
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> film festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it it's a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed more than anything it reminded me of the films of david lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels the best movie i've seen in years
<START> following the <UNK> revolution this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of <UNK> and thus the british film industry the film is absolute pants it's full of music from the attempted mid 80's jazz revival and based on a book author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly <UNK> back into obscurity temple searched for ages trying to find <UNK> and came up with <UNK> wonders <UNK> <UNK> another person who was briefly popular at the time by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over as was <UNK> career and the film met a totally <UNK> film public br br mediocre would be an <UNK> for some of the worst <UNK> <UNK> acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a <UNK> mst3k it's super bowl at the <UNK> in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don't know why i watched this
<START> normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the <UNK> perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be <UNK> or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that <UNK> nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to <UNK> a potential viewer on its merits and <UNK> nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a <UNK> incompetent attempt at a money grab <UNK> backing its <UNK> <UNK> on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i br br judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as <UNK> club for 8 bucks i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over <UNK> on big name stars and se can <UNK> an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes br br now as per <UNK> policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an <UNK> to look at a red <UNK> seriously it is a pictures of a red <UNK> in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to <UNK> the viewer however the <UNK> is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the <UNK> will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the <UNK> he looks at the <UNK> and talks to another main character about looking at the <UNK> and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks aren't two seconds or added so that dialog may be <UNK> they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already <UNK> three hour movie in a particularly <UNK> scene the main character is shown looking at a <UNK> then he is shown pacing and <UNK> then he looks at the <UNK> then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the <UNK> i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to <UNK> this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera <UNK> between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a <UNK> at tech somewhere the editing is mind <UNK> bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a <UNK> house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer <UNK> and <UNK> around when the professor says that there is a <UNK> and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a <UNK> and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs
<START> this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch the supporting cast could form a series of their own it's a seen before love <UNK> between the head of surgery his wife and a new pretty boy surgery resident only the superior acting skills of <UNK> <UNK> michael kitchen and the sexy <UNK> greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable romp the only <UNK> is that it's hard to accept that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen who like me is hardly an international or even a british sex symbol you can readily understand why <UNK> green would light her fire with apologies to the doors the guy who almost steals the show with a great laid back performance is <UNK> father david <UNK> watch him in the way we live now in a completely different performance to get an idea of his range <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> secretary sometime sex toy is hard to forget as the <UNK> mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body <UNK> <UNK> and julian <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series they are that good the whole thing is a great deal of fun and i <UNK> recommend it and thank you <UNK> for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating <UNK>
<START> i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film br br as it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see it br br the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can br br it's an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better
<START> i'm glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read <UNK> book and get the full story br br pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobs br br cons this is the worst acting job i've ever seen from jeremy <UNK> i kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character <UNK> and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end br br i'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of <UNK> <UNK> work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent <UNK> sense of snow
<START> as usual i went to watch this movie for a r <UNK> otherwise the film is no good <UNK> wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure after this he delivered a hit with <UNK> i am eagerly waiting for his forth coming <UNK> br br i have read the other <UNK> comment on <UNK> i found it interesting as the user is from <UNK> too <UNK> is one actor who acts i think from his heart not from his mind he is not a method actor like kamal <UNK> i think we need to appreciate <UNK> for his strong going at his age br br any ways i need to fill 10 lines for this comment so wish u good luck <UNK>
<START> new best friend is another entry in the steal another woman's life sub genre the best of which are single white female and the hand that rocks the cradle the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the lifetime channel for some reason this type of identity <UNK> happens exclusively to women br br there are just two basic ways to play this type of story you can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch <UNK> as she <UNK> and <UNK> her evil scheme or you use <UNK> to make her appear a good person as a seemingly <UNK> series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene unfortunately the makers of new best friend could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early we first meet alicia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> financial aid office for <UNK> money we now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion but the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying <UNK> to make us think that alicia is a good person this introduces the only element of suspense not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent <UNK> br br new best friend suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying <UNK> students there are really only two big parts hadley meredith monroe and alicia <UNK> they were <UNK> and 26 respectively at the time of the production it almost works for the 26 year old <UNK> when she plays the <UNK> version of alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the <UNK> up version of alicia <UNK> casting is simply a joke about like having <UNK> sheridan try to pass as a <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> she looks much closer to a mid life crisis than to a term paper br br the producers must have <UNK> a lot of <UNK> because this age issue <UNK> to most of the supporting characters <UNK> <UNK> who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students br br the basic setup is that hadley and two other rich party girls played by <UNK> <UNK> age 21 and rachel true age 35 are <UNK> roommates at college they share as their student <UNK> a mansion that is <UNK> and better <UNK> than the mansion on real world new orleans a premise more believable than soccer <UNK> playing students alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over <UNK> life at least that way <UNK> finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene <UNK> supporting performance is the only good thing about new best friend and her love scene with <UNK> is fantastic so cool and artsy that it doesn't fit with any of the other segments maybe it was <UNK> out to a good director and cinematographer br br the unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and <UNK> parties each <UNK> by a shot of a <UNK> alicia in a hospital bed about half of <UNK> screen time is spent lying <UNK> with a tube in her mouth not a good career move <UNK> br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this episode apparently grew out of the cold war there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth <UNK> and charles bronson have come through <UNK> it then becomes a battle for <UNK> she is attracted to him and vice versa but the instinct for survival takes over it's a quiet slow moving chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust they come to <UNK> but <UNK> takes over and they start again of course the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive but it still is captivating and interesting because she doesn't speak we don't know here mind very well but in the end we can guess
<START> <UNK> to makes here one of his best style <UNK> making a strong film with a good <UNK> story the election of the new <UNK> boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization br br in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film i specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the <UNK> family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problems br br talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> way of shooting a film one of the hong kong films of the year is like <UNK> affairs but without the easy action violence scenes and the confused storyline strongly recommended to all asian films lovers br br sorry for my english better do in spanish lol
<START> having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was <UNK> having watched 30 minutes my <UNK> were <UNK> i simply couldn't believe it the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so called comedies from the 60's and 70's the pattern is as follows take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes especially one liners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls film that and you have a success i wouldn't know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly with a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us
<START> for quite a long time in my life i either did not like this film or i liked this film but not as much as many more i watched it recently at a <UNK> <UNK> enough and i liked it more than i had done since i was under 6 or something i now appreciate it more as i do with a few other disney classics that i have watched recently including sleeping beauty and <UNK> or however you spell it br br i now very much appreciate the animation the clever disney plot turns the humour from the mice the emotions expressed and the plot the animation is very well done often it seems you are wherever the other characters are watching them the animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds including the town which is shown twice briefly disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way <UNK> clever plot turns such as the mice making the clothes and the key part usually i do not like disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story but with this i am not overly bothered i feel they made necessary changes to make this a good disney film often i do not think disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films br br you know the story already cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and <UNK> she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy <UNK> and loses a glass <UNK> br br this is a film very much to be watched with other people immediate family is not good enough to enjoy this i recommend you watch it with friends and immediate family if you like br br i recommend this to people who like disney at least a little bit people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice enjoy
<START> it's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project so refreshing and <UNK> not only to a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time but also as audience who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time br br 20 short films about love in paris are all unique but some of them as expected stand out i thought the tom <UNK> natalie portman segment was the best although the <UNK> made me smile inside just the same br br i <UNK> on spoilers option for this review bus alas what you read is a spoiler enough just watch it don't read what i write but watch the movie instead br br and smile
<START> here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film and <UNK> new film is exactly one of these jewel there are some flaws in the film of course but they are very minimal the directing and acting in this film are very good br br <UNK> wait to see another <UNK> new film
<START> red rock west is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore it's well paced well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre br br nicolas cage stars as michael an unemployed texas <UNK> desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to <UNK> for potential <UNK> he is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate br br after failing to obtain <UNK> <UNK> michael stumbles into the red rock bar where the owner wayne j t walsh mistakes him for a contract killer he <UNK> from dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife suzanne lara flynn boyle br br wayne gives michael the necessary details and a down <UNK> for the hit on the <UNK> <UNK> with no intent on following through michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn suzanne of her impending demise he also <UNK> a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and <UNK> br br as fate would <UNK> michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy while leaving in a violent <UNK> he runs down <UNK> lover of course michael being michael he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot br br the sheriff is <UNK> and as luck would have it wayne is also the local law michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real <UNK> from dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky dennis hopper after discovering that they're fellow marines <UNK> insists that michael join him for a drink at where else the red rock bar there wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and <UNK> are in hot pursuit of michael who falls willingly into <UNK> waiting arms br br as the pace picks up we learn that wayne and suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the <UNK> for a multi million dollar <UNK> getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of <UNK> double crosses and murders br br the film was very well cast nicolas cage was typically low key dennis hopper and lara flynn <UNK> assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability the best performance was by the late j t walsh who was menacing without appearing to be walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon br br marc <UNK> photography <UNK> many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development the film was further enhanced by john <UNK> tight directorial style and morris <UNK> rapid fire editing
<START> it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs <UNK> out of his ass and then gets <UNK> with it if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since the ending sucked but the rest was great
<START> one of the worst movies i ever saw my only thought was how can i get my money back from hollywood video this is no way worth four dollars or any dollars i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican or <UNK> <UNK> movies but it failed miserably to do this br br the acting was terrible i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time the story was ridiculous we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors it was so predictable the mexican accent of the leading lady was <UNK> exaggerated worse than a cartoon br br skip it
<START> it's hard to top this movie in several ways everything works really well here the casting acting script and cinematography are all first rate for the <UNK> it's a moving violent story of love and human redemption for the film critic there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit there are some <UNK> <UNK> and as has been discussed on the boards the ending lacks realism if one is <UNK> <UNK> with the cia agent training angle however i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia <UNK> <UNK> approach creasy basically <UNK> his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences like jesus himself creasy becomes <UNK> through his sacrifice whether it actually makes <UNK> sense or not in any case i appreciated the fact that creasy <UNK> with conventional <UNK> morality and just <UNK> the bad guys one by one in his <UNK> quest for justice which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent br br in any case this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre an excellent soundtrack great writing flawless casting and solid performances across the board make this a top 100 or better film
<START> this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all generally speaking i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories and this one is great besides <UNK> performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture after having <UNK> enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their <UNK> child is really an eye opening fable that exposes the <UNK> side of fellow humans and <UNK> the <UNK> of a very <UNK> and <UNK> society it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example are in reality nothing more than selfish <UNK> who would for their <UNK> beliefs and prejudices shut their brains to any <UNK> and <UNK> even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions the other face of the so called <UNK> society that the movie exposes is the <UNK> to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say this is very general even though this specific tale unfolds in australia that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought provoking
<START> i can only believe that <UNK> <UNK> must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and co wrote such excellent screenplays as <UNK> <UNK> and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and or directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda <UNK> are defeated the script sinks to it's <UNK> in the truly offensive sequence in which <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> character to make sure he's not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally <UNK> but <UNK> jokes are still good clean family fun
<START> <UNK> is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get it can hardly be classified as a war film because the only way that any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it and even these we are hardly ever shown it poses very interesting questions about life especially in the way that the movie's <UNK> says that only one of them is really alive and by the way even though the <UNK> refers only to dave ed harris and <UNK> robert deniro it is talking about all three of the characters in the film dave and <UNK> were friends in the vietnam war and <UNK> has returned to take dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed br br deniro provides a perfect performance of the character of <UNK> who we are not really sure if we should like or if he really is as nuts as martha thinks he is dave reminds martha several times that <UNK> is not his friend just someone he knows there is a great scene early in the film where <UNK> has gone out to grab a six pack of beer from his car for breakfast and he is just around the corner of the room when dave says this <UNK> pauses for a moment and then proceeds into the room with a smile and a huge <UNK> it isn't until later that you realize how <UNK> must have felt when he heard that having been the one to remember what they had planned to do on this day it reminds me of the <UNK> of the old sure let's do that ' thing that people so often say to each other never having any plans to do any such thing br br ed harris delivers a wonderful performance as dave who never got over the effects that the war had on him even so many years later he has not managed to get over the death of a friend during the war <UNK> himself to this day for it and thus drowning his life in alcohol <UNK> and loneliness all he wants he says is for people to leave him alone this is not a man who is living his life the way he wants whether people actually leave him alone or not he is a man trying to forget that he's alive to <UNK> himself from the world of the living as much as possible br br his sister martha reminds me of myself at least in terms of my roommates i have two roommates who are 21 and 24 years old and both act like they still live with their mothers expecting their <UNK> to just go away when they leave the room for a while one on particular the older one sadly enough has absolutely no clue how to care for himself i'm surprised i don't have to wipe his <UNK> while he eats martha has to do much the same for her brother who she waits on hand and foot while he <UNK> through life from one <UNK> to the next martha and dave are stuck in a <UNK> life and neither of them can get out of it until something major changes and dave is the one that needs to do the changing br br i tend to complain about romance in movies where it just doesn't belong about as much as roger ebert complains about those pathetic little tension devices the red digital <UNK> but in this case i don't think that the romance that develops between <UNK> and martha had any <UNK> affect on the rest of the movie on the contrary it made it that much more interesting because it was not predictable the problem with the romantic subplots in bruckheimer movies and <UNK> is that they are so predictable that you just wait for the obvious end to come and hope that something interesting happens along the way in this case however it's not as obvious that something is going to happen between <UNK> and martha because we don't know enough about <UNK> martha could be right about him that he's one of <UNK> crazy war buddies and that he's not the kind of man that she should be dating dave certainly encourages this idea br br spoilers a couple years after this movie deniro did cape fear where he plays a deranged criminal out for revenge against the lawyer that landed him in prison a character that in retrospect makes it pretty easy to think that maybe at the end of <UNK> martha realizes her mistake gets rid of <UNK> and she and dave make up because he saved her from a horrible relationship and then he decides to clean up his act because he has done something good for her i was half expecting this to happen so i was pleasantly surprised when martha and <UNK> wound up together and even more pleasantly surprised when <UNK> asks dave all the questions about what they had planned to do after the war was over br br at times this is a slow moving drama but <UNK> is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy there is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that <UNK> fits with the rest of the movie but it is so good that it doesn't dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point everyone involved gives a wonderful performance and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your <UNK> <UNK> in the air
<START> okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie first off the movie is so <UNK> and not real they are all acting they can't sing they are way too full of themselves its awful yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is fake its stupid don't see it br br as for the set up and directing not so bad it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing br br only see this if you don't really like good music also it's very corny it's not even <UNK> i hate to be so mean but this really is a piece of junk
<START> although i live in <UNK> i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film br br this movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each <UNK> something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with <UNK> love actually this attempt however <UNK> the magic of each individual segment <UNK> when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful message br br the film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur it's the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater can't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece br br the interesting decision to make the movie <UNK> adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the <UNK> french and so on the number of people that the film <UNK> leads to an understanding of the international language of love br br from sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the <UNK> of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of love
<START> 2 words academy award <UNK> said this film had everything in it comedy to make me laugh drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival <UNK> 2 electric <UNK> the acting was tip top of any <UNK> film jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his <UNK> on the joan cusack show his lines were executed with dynamite <UNK> and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker i thought i saw the next <UNK> of a young denzel washington when the line my bus it's gone that was the true turning point of the movie my grandmother loved it <UNK> much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony <UNK> and african american nathan davis bond through thick being held up at knife point and thin nathan giving tony <UNK> on women the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to <UNK> hollywood
<START> the <UNK> sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work br br someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy there's something about the edges of the city gritty policemen <UNK> <UNK> and mysterious <UNK> killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter br br i do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning br br as it stands only the die hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie
<START> okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just <UNK> together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now
<START> perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing albeit completely corny to adults not a bad film for a low budget job children will be amazed with <UNK> <UNK> and the magic that <UNK> him to enter homes through <UNK> that appear too small or homes that have no <UNK> at all br br kids will thrill over the <UNK> success at <UNK> the nasty devil named pitch complete in classic red outfit with <UNK> and tail they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are <UNK> by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas in the end everyone including the nasty boys get just what they deserve for christmas br br the film will <UNK> children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world br br
<START> <UNK> has the air of a dark fairy tale with its child protagonists forest setting and the discovery of a <UNK> ruins yet at its core the film is essentially an unusual <UNK> study of <UNK> opening with a dream sequence <UNK> the not so subtle metaphor of <UNK> wrestling with his menacing <UNK> the film details his psychological <UNK> of laura the girl who has <UNK> her love to him and his eventual romance with the equally <UNK> sylvia the film's psychological <UNK> do give the film merit yet there's no <UNK> how unnecessarily <UNK> the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex the film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill and there's no <UNK> the film's greatest asset is the creepy children's choir <UNK> soundtrack with its odd <UNK> quality the film is at best interesting yet <UNK> beside louis <UNK> surreal and brilliant <UNK> <UNK> from the same era certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate for unlike many banned films <UNK> <UNK> or larry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for instance the film is rather <UNK> from an artistic perspective cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock so perhaps <UNK> should be admired for <UNK> that power thirty years after its release however shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable br br the film does have its <UNK> yet so does <UNK>
<START> a real classic a <UNK> of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to <UNK> the sailors attempts a <UNK> cry for aid results in the <UNK> of the rape squad a cult film waiting to happen
<START> a director and his crew head out to the isolated <UNK> mansion to make a low budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the <UNK> family that have occurred there in the last century even with <UNK> by the caretaker the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house one of the crew find a book titled <UNK> book of the dead and use some of the <UNK> from it for their script but in doing so when red they raise a <UNK> from its grave br br boring confusing and tacky all rolled up into one equals this <UNK> midnight horror production what feels like an eternity it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas even though director paul <UNK> clunky <UNK> direction did <UNK> a couple eerie moody and atmospheric set pieces but <UNK> did set it early the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest nor is it fun think of bob <UNK> children shouldn't play with dead things 1972 and now we've got older actors in the part however i found seven corpses to be inferior the script early on has some cutting wit abound before it ends up being drab predictable and left with many <UNK> possibilities the cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either but the <UNK> dreary dark appearance had a creepy air to it performances from a recognizable b cast is mainly rigid john carradine in small part mainly <UNK> about john ireland plays a hot headed director faith <UNK> washed up actress demands attention and charles <UNK> <UNK> it up the slow <UNK> premise is crossed between ten little indians and your usual zombie set up however its not all that engaging even with its occult and supernatural edge hell they even throw in some graveyard action with no <UNK> when the rotting <UNK> makes its <UNK> finally but a bit late it does get a little better if very <UNK> just like the inspired opening the ending is deliciously downbeat to bad in between it constantly drags continuity in many scenes comes across non existent and the death scenes are more exciting and <UNK> but indeed poorly executed in the movie they're making then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears the generic music score <UNK> on with its <UNK> but frank gothic <UNK> and the camera work is <UNK> staged with a lack of imagination shoot and frame shoot and frame job done that's a wrap
<START> unfortunately jean <UNK> 1938 1981 belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds since we have a good old fashioned video store in <UNK> i had the chance to watch this 3 1 2 hour marathon <UNK> that is not boring for ten seconds br br since we speak here about one of the most discussed and most <UNK> discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early <UNK> vague of a jacques <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> appear almost ridiculous in this movie the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jean pierre <UNK> the most characteristic feature is that the <UNK> of the speeches of two people is almost zero <UNK> or his character alexandre <UNK> to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie it is well possible that the director had a <UNK> satire in mind against the <UNK> running of the once so <UNK> discussed political and <UNK> ideas but the type of man alexandre exists to all times we find him already in <UNK> <UNK> which work has actually great resemblance with the mother and the whore br br alexandre does not only nothing but he has developed an own kind of <UNK> about the absence of acting at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is he <UNK> at the people who run to work at 7 <UNK> in the morning when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives he is unable to speak one sentence without <UNK> one of the leading <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> especially <UNK> who is shown quickly in the french intellectual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the life style of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from <UNK> <UNK> however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudo intellectual and the sentences and <UNK> he <UNK> seem to come rather from a <UNK> of <UNK> than from his actual reading of the respective books br br it is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the <UNK> of french <UNK> philosophy and there consequences to the <UNK> student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy <UNK> minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time
<START> space camp which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the <UNK> accident deserves such luck the stars make a mockery of acting <UNK> <UNK> actually being turned <UNK> when asked for more than her usual wide eyed innocent smile presumably to mask her <UNK> attempts the movie is at times hilarious when it begins to ask far too much of you a small boy keeps a multi million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many <UNK> by the <UNK> of cliched <UNK> mates this hackneyed and <UNK> machine <UNK> is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie which seems part short circuit part 2001 by the airplane team i <UNK> bore you with this suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it having said all of this it is enjoyable to watch in a <UNK> saved by the bell kind of way the romance and technology beware are as unbelievable as each other also if you're an eighties freak its <UNK> for the amusing performances of kate <UNK> willie from temple of doom and obviously <UNK> thompson also <UNK> phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe <UNK> who befriends <UNK> do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash
<START> trick or treat <UNK> review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies two things which i love <UNK> so as you can imagine this movie <UNK> to me pretty easily plus for no apparent reason <UNK> <UNK> plays a preacher br br this film is about an <UNK> high school youth who like all us losers ended up <UNK> in a world of evil heavy metal his favorite <UNK> dies and of course is miraculously <UNK> by playing his latest <UNK> album backwards this allows the <UNK> singer to go around killing people with demons and sh t helping out br br okay it's pretty cheesy at times but you know what it's got a surprising number of good qualities decent acting including gene simmons as a radio dj pretty good special effects very brief nudity decent atmosphere all in all it's actually a decent horror film but what really sucks is the music ironic huh well this uber evil metal guy is one of the most obnoxious high pitched <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rejects on the planet and the metal is little more than <UNK> 80's pop hair metal he hits all the <UNK> here from <UNK> around like a gay fairy to looking mean to screaming rock and roll in a pitch high enough to make king diamond <UNK> aside from that atrocious musical representation it's actually pretty good 7 10 br br www <UNK> com
<START> perhaps i'm not a <UNK> this and closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films i've seen recently and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent the dialogue is false false false nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely believable perhaps the way this film is set up that's the way it's supposed to feel but it was unwatchable and boring i walked out after 20 minutes of tedium br br i'll stick with sleeper and <UNK> for my woody allen fix if i ever come across this on the <UNK> i'll turn over and try to find an episode of <UNK> instead
<START> my one line summary should explain it all but i'll have a go at it br br from the get go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and that's about all i can comment on there were a few interesting scenes such as the big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait what's that the <UNK> gasp wait a minute that's <UNK> peak well parts of it butchered and slapped in i can't believe how poorly this movie was done <UNK> scenes from other much better films one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large <UNK> mountain <UNK> backdrops exist in downtown la ala <UNK> peak br br my advise forget the bond wanna be <UNK> in this film and go for the real thing again someone from <UNK> peak <UNK> br br
<START> not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third <UNK> of 70s child actors <UNK> <UNK> and kim richards i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in <UNK> going against linda blair in stranger in our house i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film later on repeat i saw i made the right choice the movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises although i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no <UNK>
<START> i can't say whether the post wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not but i am completely addicted and the man in the white suit is one of the best no need to go into the well known plot about the threat <UNK> to both the <UNK> industry and the <UNK> <UNK> by an <UNK> dirt <UNK> <UNK> suffice it to say that the <UNK> and <UNK> suffered by the <UNK> idealistic sidney <UNK> in pursuing his <UNK> vision make for a comedic delight many of the well known faces from the world of british character actors the nervous cecil parker the <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> and the <UNK> ruthless ernest <UNK> put in wonderful performances guinness as always and forever is superb and joan <UNK> is <UNK> as daphne just the way she <UNK> the word daddy makes the entire movie worth seeing br br <UNK>
<START> doctor feinstone is a dentist he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant he realises that behind everything clean there is <UNK> he starts to torture his patients corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist he is completely believable there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque highly recommended the dentist 2 is also worth checking out
<START> the fifth black <UNK> i've watched has potentially the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the <UNK> female reporter investigating the white slavery prostitution <UNK> which takes her from san francisco to rome to <UNK> and back to her own hometown new york the film is <UNK> with past veterans of the series which inexplicably play completely different roles namely <UNK> <UNK> appearing here as a head of a united nations <UNK> for third world countries <UNK> <UNK> as a feminist rival reporter and don powell as <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately as usual with this type of film despite their being shown in the dead of night it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene described in <UNK> in which an asian slave <UNK> gets his <UNK> by being <UNK> by a dog is nowhere to be seen here still a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls including naturally <UNK> and <UNK> into a midnight <UNK> under a new york bridge with a group of <UNK> this is the way he gets their votes get it with his high society pals <UNK> looking on seems pretty much intact br br the most ridiculous element of this entry apart from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> completely every time she enters a house even in front of perfect strangers is her <UNK> to india to interview a <UNK> guru george <UNK> made up to look considerably christ like who has found a way to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of course when <UNK> calls him up on it he ends up having <UNK> <UNK>
<START> although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don't know why i think i like it because the moral of the story is <UNK> is garbage so turn it off and go and get a <UNK> for those of you who do decide to <UNK> the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all to ruin it for you at the end of the story a <UNK> wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and <UNK> down the network at the same time i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9 11
<START> <UNK> at a military school <UNK> sounds funny maybe offensive to some you have the characters there the arab thief the sex crazy teen the smart mouth the pot <UNK> and not to forget the guy who burns things throw in a strict no nonsense <UNK> a homosexual <UNK> and one sexy <UNK> teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure br br i have seen this film and it is funny because the comedy is <UNK> around the fact that if you try to work together things get done br br these band of <UNK> students at <UNK> military school have been placed in here because as sgt <UNK> quotes because you are <UNK> <UNK> to your families and <UNK> <UNK> one of ralph <UNK> earlier performances before the karate kid and my cousin <UNK> with appearances from barbara bach as well this film appeals to teens and young adults br br great soundtrack keeps the film moving
<START> i gave this movie a very fair chance and it betrayed me this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the <UNK> <UNK> who did way better with targets gets great performances out of a ton of <UNK> in their <UNK> lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie such as doing the <UNK> wife <UNK> doing the ugly prostitute which is very <UNK> shot and <UNK> things to a complete halt not that things were really going anywhere anyway and skinny <UNK> br br i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense to me it was just annoying i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess
<START> cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way outdated br br as a real fan of tv's <UNK> i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill <UNK> and jean <UNK> as <UNK> jane are far more on target br br we don't have any giants in hollywood anymore <UNK> is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936 1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released re <UNK> re <UNK> all over again filmmakers like today's spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a <UNK> none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years
<START> jack frost no kids it's not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man it's about a sadistic killer named jack frost who is <UNK> with some acid fluid and is <UNK> into a killer snow man i happened to catch a copy of this movie so i could have a nice sit back and laugh at it a killer snow man ha sounds like the perfect comedy horror movie well i was wrong very wrong br br jack frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could <UNK> in the chair at midnight but it's a snowy night and it <UNK> with a government <UNK> carrying a new <UNK> fluid jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and <UNK> into a killer snowman he returns to the small town of <UNK> where he was caught by a small time sheriff here he is ready to kill again now as a snow man with <UNK> powers he can <UNK> into water shoot out ice <UNK> as spears and grow killer <UNK> the only question is who can stop frost this movie is below the typical b movie line the movies begins cheesy but as soon as jack is burned by the acid it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat the acting for one is appalling here we have a whole cast of <UNK> of actors who either can't act can act but has a pointless character or is just here for a few extra bucks the only good actor is scott macdonald who plays jack he looks like a young richard <UNK> combined with frankenstein sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice plus his <UNK> are anything but funny <UNK> stupid and bad br br the plot is horrible throughout history there have been numerous murderers a killer in a hockey mask a killer with a <UNK> <UNK> a chainsaw wielding moron a rapid st bernard but now we <UNK> to a tacky killer snow man oh come on and the way the characters are introduced are terrible for one i really wanted jack to kill the <UNK> son i mean giving his dad <UNK> with <UNK> in them so they won't freeze all the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to <UNK> one woman in <UNK> with christmas lights and has her head <UNK> into a decoration box and a girl is <UNK> to death in the shower where is the <UNK> in that scene eh br br and to top of this horrible movie is the special effects the first big special effect we have is jack's <UNK> mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible i mean it looks like a 60's fashion of art design <UNK> jack looks fake as well he looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin all the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead <UNK> to low levels br br jack frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made i thought it would be a riot but no it doesn't try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary jack frost gets 4 out of 10 it at least made me laugh from it's awfulness don't even bother with this piece of trash jack frost d
<START> this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still don't even get it magical power 300 years later <UNK> dancing what the f is that about the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure
<START> i watched this hoping to find out something i <UNK> t know about modern history s most infamous man and <UNK> t help thinking that history has been <UNK> in hitler the rise of evil hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer s shot hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest <UNK> <UNK> forgive me for asking but <UNK> t the writers confused <UNK> hitler with tony montana from scarface that s bad enough but what really offended me was that there s entire <UNK> of historical context missing in this mini series germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone anyone to <UNK> their pride and that s why they turned to <UNK> the german <UNK> of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitler the rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document and i <UNK> t even mentioned that <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> by their absence br br there is one positive point about the mini series and that s robert <UNK> in the title role okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud archive <UNK> show that hitler had a soft seductive voice but <UNK> is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitler s own charisma on screen comments in the british press that <UNK> resembles the <UNK> player from sparks more than <UNK> hitler are <UNK> and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitler br br i liked the performance by robert <UNK> but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place there s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
<START> this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf but it came on <UNK> one day and i said eric <UNK> william forsythe why not if i'd changed the channel i would have really missed a treasure br br the subject is depressing young author <UNK> in climbing accident <UNK> in lower class <UNK> center it would have been so easy and <UNK> to make this a manipulative tear <UNK> but that doesn't happen because it was written by <UNK> <UNK> after he himself was <UNK> <UNK> no hollywood happiness here all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds but they share a feeling of <UNK> of being at the mercy of others <UNK> is very good as a lone wolf type forced into embarrassing <UNK> on his girlfriend helen hunt wesley snipes is fine as a former <UNK> man whose family is falling apart but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence br br see this film
<START> this is almost the worst film you will ever see <UNK> <UNK> currently pulls the <UNK> from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank <UNK> once referred to as <UNK> ' it looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station just prior to <UNK> the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and <UNK> obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction <UNK> belief br br but you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
<START> my main comment on this movie is how <UNK> was able to get credible actors to work on this movie impressive cast  even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really i have to admit though tom <UNK> cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom did you lose a bet the best cameo of the movie was joe <UNK> though by far a classic the premise is good <UNK> character struggling with existence as a pink lady is making her way toward vegas motel by motel <UNK> the glorious <UNK> of <UNK> sales this happens as <UNK> character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex wife motivated <UNK> what <UNK> <UNK> as they both make their way they have numerous run ins with elvis <UNK> who on their way to an elvis <UNK> convention in vegas soon the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis <UNK> serial killer unfortunately premise doesn't mean the movie was good br br when watching this movie imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense the movie tries hard but ultimately falls way way way short ultimately it is filled with ideas that could have <UNK> been funny but in practice were not that funny br br it isn't the worst but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this <UNK> don't say i didn't warn you
<START> make up your own mind personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from <UNK> wonder no offense mr wonder maybe it is comedy but i just found it stupid not exactly the first two choices to <UNK> your kids <UNK> <UNK> william scott and danny paul rudd two energy drink <UNK> to <UNK> jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by <UNK> <UNK> jane lynch one of the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> j thompson a foul mouthed fifth <UNK> and the other is <UNK> christopher <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world <UNK> and danny desperately try to give their charges an <UNK> inside view of life love and heavy metal lynch is hilarious with her dry wit <UNK> supporting are elizabeth banks ken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> silver amanda <UNK> and david <UNK>
<START> reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new favourite movie br br i don't know what all the hate here is about maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead but there will be a lot of supporting male characters this one was almost all women with the exception of seth meyers justin hartley and the brief appearance of will <UNK> and it worked all of the actresses delivered very funny performances especially <UNK> <UNK> from a quirky and lovable script br br the charm of this film to me seems to be in its subtle feminist message accepting who you are female success in the public <UNK> the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles light hearted though it is each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more <UNK> conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all female cast and lack of a big name actor to get the studios behind it and i have to agree everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female <UNK> hasn't been widely accepted and successful br br i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female <UNK> comedy
<START> i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge <UNK> br br the settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark <UNK> is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very good br br but the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying <UNK> on the ground but the humans don t attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all
<START> no this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror <UNK> isn't about a deadly <UNK> possessed <UNK> cake still this exceptionally awful yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable <UNK> ray refuse reaches a breathtaking <UNK> of absolute <UNK> silliness and <UNK> that's quite tasty in a so <UNK> it's downright awesome sort of way richard crenna looking <UNK> and possibly <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail <UNK> portray a <UNK> nice and respectable <UNK> couple whose quaint dull sleepy small town existence gets ripped <UNK> when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit pretty soon <UNK> and her two <UNK> <UNK> kids kim richards and <UNK> <UNK> the psychic alien <UNK> from the disney witch mountain pictures are <UNK> a crude <UNK> drawing of the nasty ugly <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> boy now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing well scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous <UNK> sure ain't but it sure is funny thanks to curtis night tide <UNK> hopelessly weak direction cartoonish not so special effects an almost painfully <UNK> plot and a game cast that struggles <UNK> with the absurd story besides the leads both <UNK> <UNK> and r g armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor <UNK> has a nice cameo as a helpful native american <UNK> favorite scene the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> puts the <UNK> on crenna practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning <UNK> blade while stuck up <UNK> fright film fans may hold their <UNK> at the perfectly <UNK> <UNK> of this admittedly <UNK> schlock <UNK> tv trash lovers should <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> tube equivalent to <UNK>
<START> the night <UNK> held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes <UNK> with his friendship with a 14 year old boy <UNK> culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the <UNK> however <UNK> ex boyfriend nice job from bobby <UNK> raises doubt about the boy which <UNK> williams to <UNK> a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars br br i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> mother sandra oh also starred as <UNK> friend the night <UNK> is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10
<START> this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original it's directed by martin <UNK> of friday the 13th fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george make up effects artist for the film his effects are so off the wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get the movie isn't really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty <UNK> <UNK> scene in the middle involving a toy <UNK> what mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo 4th installment my favorite of all 5 you'll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy
<START> it's been a <UNK> time since i saw this comedy and i'd forgotten just how idiotic it is i'd place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis <UNK> very worst movies <UNK> plays joe <UNK> a half breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken down shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and <UNK> <UNK> and his old indian grandpa is thomas <UNK> none of the three offer anything of substance <UNK> or otherwise the government has invested in the family's cattle but they're lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boy crazy gal and her gun <UNK> mother this is just a real <UNK> of a mess and the <UNK> surroundings practically stink of <UNK> and don't make this much easier the one thing that <UNK> me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies
<START> this movie is just truly awful the eye candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie br br the writer director producer lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage family acceptance religion <UNK> hate crimes and just about every other issue <UNK> a gay man of these times but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes br br the script is poor the casting very ordinary but the dialogue and acting is just <UNK> the <UNK> hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors i think i've seen more passion in an corn <UNK> ad the acting is stiff and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight br br i'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution and if he is thinking of doing so i have some advise just don't do it
<START> avoid this crap at all costs bad script bad directing bad acting bad editing bad sound and bad music get the idea this movie tries to be western <UNK> it's not it tries to be hard core violent it's not it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre it doesn't the actors try there best and my heart goes out to them but with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine to me this has all of the looks of a fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire first attempt <UNK> film makers often bite off more that they or their budget can chew the best thing they can do is to take a few steps back <UNK> what is possible and work within their limited budget the next time out
<START> felt it was very balanced in showing what <UNK> witnesses have done in protecting american <UNK> it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a <UNK> witness affects non witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don't celebrate holidays the sad part is that non witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family <UNK> visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or <UNK> when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care what people forget is that blood <UNK> allow for sloppy medical care and <UNK> whereas <UNK> <UNK> causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained which would you prefer to treat your loved ones i highly recommend this video
<START> i rented this tape a couple of years ago and boy did it suck from the commercials i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women and that was where the comedy would lie boy was i wrong the jokes were vulgar and they were just not funny don't bother 1 10
<START> a <UNK> science team seem to have <UNK> a serum which causes <UNK> but when the lead <UNK> tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process frustrated and drunk with power he turns psychotic in the classic h g wells tradition br br this is a <UNK> horrible invisible man story delivered with <UNK> by the ever <UNK> verhoeven and bacon as the genius turned <UNK> maniac as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific <UNK> sense of boy's own comic book adventure the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful combined with the most horrific and <UNK> visuals women in their underwear being <UNK> and attacked by an invisible fiend animals beaten to death literally <UNK> of blood and <UNK> slaughter in the last two <UNK> whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea the cg special effects by scott e anderson are eye <UNK> brilliant as we see <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> systems <UNK> <UNK> bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere in particular a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon <UNK> <UNK> in a swimming pool are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry <UNK> and classic horror movie photography by <UNK> <UNK> the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical <UNK> but both <UNK> and dickens are <UNK> out of their depth this is a great fun nasty movie
<START> george <UNK> directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch ronald <UNK> performance which earned him an oscar still stands up despite a few overwrought moments  it's hard to forget his haunted <UNK> as he <UNK> <UNK> around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life there are a number of interesting <UNK> and <UNK> does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much the script by <UNK> <UNK> and ruth gordon is brilliant mixing the <UNK> theater world with the seedy world of the streets and <UNK> <UNK> elements from shakespeare's king <UNK> as a reference to both the film's main theme of jealousy and <UNK> character's obsession with identity br br several interesting things about this movie  <UNK> it could be <UNK> as too <UNK> a treatment of the everyday problems of actors in other words if the art of acting required such complete <UNK> of <UNK> we would soon have a <UNK> of psycho method actors stalking the streets but i don't really think this story's primary concern is acting or the job art of acting per se i think <UNK> struggles represents a <UNK> existential question a deeply buried <UNK> about identity there's a key i feel in his relationship with his ex wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration and at another point he <UNK> states that his extreme <UNK> with his roles began when he married her i'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me especially because it's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top perhaps the <UNK> is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship marriage implies a union of the soul in the traditional conception it's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film it's not completely <UNK> <UNK> comedy his girl friday springs to mind among others but it is unusual and probably significant especially in light of the fact that they do not end up <UNK> their romantic <UNK> in a way the film could be <UNK> that jealousy is another form of self love
<START> i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didn't look right the same way <UNK> pig doesn't look right in the old 1930's cartoons but i <UNK> br br anyway this episode in the friendly <UNK> <UNK> concerns him <UNK> a young fox todd whom he names <UNK> i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghost br br casper and <UNK> have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semi spoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you can't really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can <UNK> what happens next br br the finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact it's probably the saddest i've ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me i haven't seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and <UNK> happy again br br i'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most i've ever been moved by an animated short
<START> while traveling by train through europe the american jesse ethan hawke and the french celine julie <UNK> meet each other and decide to spend the night together in <UNK> on the next morning jesse returns to united states of america and celine to paris br br before sunrise is one of my favorite romances indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie <UNK> is perfect and the dialogs are stunning the direction is amazing <UNK> the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer i have just completed my review number 1 000 in imdb and i choose before sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar with such a magnificent screenplay direction and performances yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and i still love it my vote is ten br br title brazil <UNK> do <UNK> before sunrise
<START> being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it i was not disappointed in fact this film greatly <UNK> my expectations knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on moon child has just the right amount of humour action romance and serious heart wrenching moments i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair in my opinion definitely proving their skills as actors the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of <UNK> to begin with you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde
<START> this movie is great it touched my stone cold heart i couldn't relate about the racial <UNK> that antwone has experienced because i'm living in my own country i guess it is really hard to be <UNK> br br we watched this film in our <UNK> class in new era university and i didn't knew that it was a true story i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry it is very good br br the part that shocked me was when <UNK> abused antwone who was just six sexually if i were on his shoes i could have jumped a ten story high building i <UNK> him for he being so strong br br the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face he did not <UNK> her or whatever instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated i think i'll do that when i get the chance of <UNK> my roots
<START> i can't believe others took such a serious view of all this god it was a lot of fun rooting for hop a long cassidy it was a great tribute to the western serials of years ago it wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience except it was so what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza it was a fun tongue in cheek look at old <UNK> man relax and enjoy
<START> i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely <UNK> and altogether too harsh so i have decided to write my own i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then first of all let me say that overall the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults it is worth watching the idea of <UNK> a movie on walt <UNK> visit a <UNK> narrow minded <UNK> canadian community in southern <UNK> and bringing people to life is a brilliant <UNK> en scene the movie is about the kind of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> inspired in people and in that sense it is exactly accurate the acting especially by rip torn <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the doctor is very good the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the <UNK> and <UNK> of the time overall what's not to like besides name another film in which <UNK> is brought so vividly to life
<START> this film though <UNK> acclaimed has of course not yet been released in the u s on dvd like another great christine <UNK> <UNK> out the same year but if you can support region 4 australian dvd's this little masterpiece should be in your collection there are still some vhs copies available on the internet as well davis is <UNK> by a great story as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast especially <UNK> <UNK> and the late great jan adele amazingly or maybe not this film and its stars went <UNK> at academy awards time as did <UNK> but treat yourself to both of them you will be glad you did
<START> just finished watching the groove tube which i first saw about 23 years ago when i was a teenager staying up way past my <UNK> watching hbo with my brother and his best friend we had also watched animal house just before that so we saw two movies that starred an snl <UNK> and had some naked breasts good thing our parents were asleep the whole time anyway there were lots of weird and funny things in this movie that were eye <UNK> like the brown 25 sequence of the <UNK> <UNK> commercial with the taste of <UNK> <UNK> says the <UNK> as what is apparently human <UNK> comes out of a white tube <UNK> or the face of the puppet talking about <UNK> a <UNK> with a small penis with eyes glued on chevy chase and richard <UNK> made their feature film <UNK> here chase is hilarious whether doing a <UNK> spot with a woman <UNK> having his hands have sex in a let fingers do it commercial or singing four <UNK> <UNK> with co writer director ken <UNK> <UNK> his hands on his head <UNK> teams with <UNK> in the dealers movie and on channel one evening news with one wild bit having <UNK> as a black prostitute trying tricks on reporter ken who plays lionel here lionel that sounds like a train that i'm going to ride like a <UNK> <UNK> other outrageous bits include the <UNK> show with <UNK> as a kid clown show host who after <UNK> the people over ten to leave the room reads <UNK> of his viewers like <UNK> of <UNK> hill or how about the <UNK> segment with a german couple making love being announced by two men one of them spanish as they get explicit while please stand by keeps <UNK> on the screen or the animated segment on the dealers which depicts dancing <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> some marijuana not <UNK> so dirty besides the four <UNK> <UNK> skit at the end there's a highly amusing music segment with ken lip <UNK> his own recording of just you just me while dancing with suit and <UNK> around the city with occasionally a cop co writer lane <UNK> joining in so in <UNK> this is one <UNK> funny movie that seemed to influence other like films <UNK> kentucky fried movie and possibly saturday night live which made chevy that show's first star and despite some dated elements can still <UNK> today p s while i liked hearing curtis <UNK> move on up during the <UNK> dancing <UNK> beginning sequence i did wonder what the point was with the sequence of the <UNK> and the woman who picked him up having them running from the car <UNK> on the run and then having the naked man get caught by the cop who stopped on the road guess it's one of those '70s <UNK> things
<START> soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very <UNK> even by today's standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the <UNK> premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought provoking this film's quality level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of <UNK> is a depressing place to be alive with over population <UNK> an <UNK> climate and the total <UNK> of every vital food product the only form of food available is <UNK> and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of <UNK> most <UNK> executives and he stumbles upon <UNK> and dark secrets the script is a little over sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot sequence is truly <UNK> and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great but too modest supportive role for joseph <UNK> baron blood the <UNK> dr <UNK> this is science fiction in my book a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity no fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
<START> i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didn't think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongue in cheek humor concerning families around holiday time br br ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funny br br so he makes silly <UNK> of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all br br also the whole doo <UNK> act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the <UNK> parents didn't even say anything about it and the parts where doo <UNK> is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable
<START> some of the worst least natural acting performances i've ever seen which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television one doesn't expect much from a lifetime movie especially one this old but this is nearly <UNK> bad br br plot wise it's a dreadful clichéd romance of a type even <UNK> would consider beneath them it's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes surprise the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love
<START> but there are not too many of them probably the worst major release film i have seen in my life definitely the worst for this year there is no point in commenting on the plot the cast or the acting the problem is beyond all that it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind not the funny kind of everything that takes place on the screen i don't know why i gave it a 2 10 instead of 1 10 probably because of steven <UNK> he really did try bottom line 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells avoid at any cost
<START> there are a couple of prior comments here which <UNK> about this <UNK> abundance of clichés throughout and i agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialog br br i'd read about elizabeth <UNK> awful performance in the equally awful <UNK> which i've never seen and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of <UNK> worse fare there was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldn't have been if so it would have placed the film completely out of balance since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayal br br the <UNK> handling of <UNK> initial complaint after her <UNK> had <UNK> her in the hall was laughable her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest <UNK> attacking <UNK> boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentally challenged br br the smarmy <UNK> lawyer excuse the <UNK> father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney was more of an <UNK> nerd also not unknown in the profession br br finally and frankly i rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of <UNK> <UNK> that you'd rather depend upon barney <UNK> without andy to handle all law <UNK> and investigation in your community i know that most real like cops fall a bit short of the <UNK> intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order <UNK> and the like but <UNK> of this level seem to be a <UNK> on lifetime br br finally i found a kind of story within a story fascination with <UNK> <UNK> of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from f to f minus br br this whole lame situation should have been resolved in real life in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have <UNK> the contrived drama following and left an <UNK> blank film in the camera br br but the writer s here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and <UNK> this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what <UNK> might have been <UNK> in any real world context for the <UNK> and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption br br this one's a 2 presentation the second because it does have some mild fascination
<START> this one is out there not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of <UNK> i can see why this film was banned for so long the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the <UNK> in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film it's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films i came across this film on the net that i thought i might check out i enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time something you don't rarely see in films today
<START> <UNK> the blues is an oscar nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of <UNK> jazz played in one long jam marie <UNK> sings the sunny side of the street at one point for the film's highlight then <UNK> with <UNK> savage to bring this most entertaining jam session to its exciting end the director <UNK> <UNK> was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the <UNK> according to some notes i read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in <UNK> in reflection of the social attitudes of the time what a shame still this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube so if you love jazz i suggest you seek it out there
<START> i chose to see the this film on the day it opened <UNK> in france as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous the collection works as intended it <UNK> a <UNK> of thoughts and emotions working as an intellectual <UNK> never <UNK> to cheap sentimentality nor <UNK> jerk <UNK> br br there have been many <UNK> made that the film is anti american while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue people make much noise about the egyptian segment by <UNK> because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide <UNK> <UNK> that civilians in a democracy are fair targets for they <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> are seeking to attack but this ignores much else in the piece several perspectives are discussed no one being held up as the truth and critics if they even saw the piece seem to forget the <UNK> and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy br br pretty much all of the films are beautiful thoughtful inspiring in particular the brilliant work by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> good as usual effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti islam <UNK> that swept and still <UNK> the states i did find <UNK> piece a bit <UNK> loud and simple in it's critic of media <UNK> in the face of terrorism and <UNK> piece was too <UNK> and <UNK> for my tastes though i had expected to like it <UNK> is very good and brave in it spoiler warning one reviewer below <UNK> read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what because light <UNK> his room keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize again this is a sort of <UNK> piece for we know that if the towers were really <UNK> the light to this man's flat then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash not light <UNK> through his window
<START> certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most pre star wars science fiction it tends to take too long <UNK> itself br br but still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic <UNK> to provide the musical score <UNK> the robot <UNK> the <UNK> robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from <UNK> to data br br the plot line of course is shakespeare's the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> wizard who finds his kingdom <UNK> by <UNK> it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first
<START> i watched this as part of my course at <UNK> university and it <UNK> me how this does not have a <UNK> in the uk well actually it doesn't because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't original creative quirky and humorous it seems that today no one really wants to see this type of movie as in the <UNK> terms it doesn't <UNK> to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film br br i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes essentially it is about nothing as the two main characters are <UNK> into their own world of <UNK> through a hate of the world the brilliance here is how the director <UNK> interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only <UNK> en scene consists of half a house and a vast white empty space this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles br br i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed fashion with the combination of good performances a strong script nice sound design and fairly impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie br br it's just a shame so few people know about nothing
<START> the 14 year old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that they're all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of <UNK> making loads of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden <UNK> which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year stardust based on a novel by neil <UNK> showed up in theaters this week with little more than a <UNK> i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials the critical reaction is kind of blah i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend well if you'll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly <UNK> because i went to see stardust and i loved it it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest the hero sets out to look for a fallen star filled with obstacles but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance and it succeeds wonderfully there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one there's a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent it isn't a masterpiece but it definitely can <UNK> the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre
<START> this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard <UNK> action flick it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share <UNK> action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all <UNK> is an enjoyable action flick but <UNK> seen it a million times before
<START> this movie is truly brilliant it <UNK> through <UNK> to crap at such speed you don't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go <UNK> past but it doesn't stop there this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it <UNK> back to the point of ludicrous comedy behold as <UNK> the <UNK> conan wannabe with the over abundance of neck hair <UNK> his stuff swinging his sword like there's no tomorrow and the way he <UNK> it i really am amazed there was a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut don't miss this movie it's a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody <UNK> and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid <UNK> gave these people another 5 to make a sequel
<START> imagine its say 12 <UNK> your at home your bored your not tired this scenario occurred about say 4 or so years back i turned on the tv and <UNK> over a few channels and found that this film was on oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen a runaway car that cant be stopped <UNK> the <UNK> have been cut or something in <UNK> it down the <UNK> whats gonna happen this film was so bad its actually funny i think the stunts cost about 2 to make there was one instance where a baby small child is being <UNK> from the car by a helicopter in an attempt to <UNK> the viewer a conveniently placed bridge is <UNK> ahead this is the best bad bit of a film ever it shows the child <UNK> missing the bridge but it looks so bad you can almost see the make of the <UNK> that they used total low budget classic cant remember the end of the film though but i bet it was great br br i doubt they will ever show this film again so i'm glad i got to see this piece of trash
<START> the <UNK> leads the dance what a laughable title it's so utterly misleading it's not surprising that the film makers try and <UNK> us though because this is one terrible movie br br the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island br br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his <UNK> it <UNK> is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice artists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of <UNK> level morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voice artists cannot be blamed for the script it's a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious br br the whole enterprise <UNK> of pure exploitation of the audience it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few half hearted severed head shots br br a few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide <UNK> as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it it's basically a soft core porn film with a horror angle but it's not very erotic either br br i can't recommend this to anyone
<START> this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clichés you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly <UNK> one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23 year old <UNK> dance as sexual it's merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywood's <UNK> this is for you i bought the <UNK> version on vhs making the movie even worse <UNK> heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and she's the best part of this film what a way to launch a career
<START> i'm not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant <UNK> who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news <UNK> voice over which states the u s has just <UNK> to nazi germany on may 7 1945 to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close br br 1 the older viewer must <UNK> up the equivalent of two or three more <UNK> movies in their <UNK> eye to fill in the <UNK> <UNK> between movie events and this startling conclusion br br 2 the average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these <UNK> fill in the <UNK> flicks created in their own head for free instead of <UNK> out time and money to see this <UNK> from the video store or on cable br br 3 this end credits sequence of imagined news <UNK> may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is just a character actor the sort of person people almost never would know by name however he once again plays the <UNK> one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once i've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air this film also is great to watch because in addition to <UNK> there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride including grant mitchell gene <UNK> henry <UNK> kent smith h b warner and <UNK> <UNK> this is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce br br these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b movies while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the <UNK> writing and acting the films really satisfy as for this film vance is played wonderfully by lowe but like i said the mystery itself is only an after thought with a silly plot involving <UNK> and <UNK> unfortunately you cannot <UNK> anyone to do anything of the sort i have training in <UNK> <UNK> and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film i would have done it used car <UNK> and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets br br overall while not the best philo vance film it was very good and it's a darn shame lowe only played this role once in fact aside from william powell who played vance five times the series was <UNK> by a long long succession of actors such as basil <UNK> <UNK> hyde white and warren william and many others playing vance this is a similar problem that also plagued the <UNK> <UNK> series just too many different actors playing the leading man br br well worth seeing and exciting though also quite impossible
<START> <UNK> life is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward actually it was more like a home movie and if you want dramatic <UNK> see something else and it's by no means a <UNK> but i mean that in positive ways it shows two men who love each other and how being <UNK> with aids is affecting the quality of their every day lives it's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not because it was so <UNK> that i had to look for other ways to respond it's an admirable film actually one of the most admirable sincere documents i've ever seen these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts it makes hollow wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless these men made this movie for themselves which is one of the best reasons to create something the scene where tom sings you are my sunshine to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing
<START> bo is jane parker whose long lost <UNK> father richard harris in the worst role of a very inconsistent career is in africa studying something or another she tracks him down how and he tells her of the <UNK> stories of a giant monster whose <UNK> howling can be heard throughout the jungle turns out to be the ape man himself miles <UNK> who has the film's best dialogue who <UNK> her from bad guys and falls in love with her leaving them just enough time in this <UNK> two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers normally i'm very open minded to varying opinions about any film but this is the sole exception this is the worst film ever made if you don't agree you haven't seen it notes <UNK> called it <UNK> which is the best one word summary i can think of the <UNK> movie guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than bomb
<START> an accurate review of <UNK> must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie <UNK> tom cruise <UNK> 2008 at long last tells the world there was a german resistance during world war two <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> military <UNK> soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the nazi political regime <UNK> a new <UNK> obtain peace and close the concentration camps however these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the french resistance just next door history writers have used an <UNK> agenda ever since to <UNK> an allied evil which cost many <UNK> of millions of lives with everyone <UNK> to believe a deception that the german people completely supported the nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing <UNK> and <UNK> surrender that was <UNK> on the germans br br the german <UNK> <UNK> were broken by english scientists in 1943 so much of what the germans were doing was known during 1943 the germans developed new jet fighters and jet <UNK> by companies including <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> however even if the nazis were eliminated and the german resistance succeeded the allies wouldn't allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters jet <UNK> high speed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and radio guided <UNK> without the usa having them first this is where the <UNK> agenda is relevant consequently the german resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate <UNK> hitler the 20 july 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the germans to obtain peace instead the germans got <UNK> of <UNK> surrender and 24 hour <UNK> bombing in an agenda to avoid peace the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans and contain complete <UNK> through an <UNK> surrender it was a <UNK> allied agenda to allow the war to <UNK> and keep the nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after d day before allied <UNK> advanced into germany to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun however <UNK> of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the german resistance for their own greed br br the allies <UNK> <UNK> surrender on the germans as a <UNK> to complete <UNK> and control of german property and government and it was done without using the german resistance to over throw the nazis the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans to achieve world technological supremacy consequently everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of german people in the 24 hour bombing the concentration camps stayed open the war was prolonged and led to the cold war with weapons based on german industrial achievements technology and scientists taken from the germans in world war two br br the 1946 <UNK> war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder <UNK> by the allies as <UNK> justice to the nazis it was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the german resistance <UNK> the nazi political regime br br <UNK> of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the german resistance to an agenda but they inflicted <UNK> against the german <UNK> of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at <UNK> war crimes or not although the allies had <UNK> <UNK> to achieve world technological supremacy

<START> this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies <UNK> the legacy i'm not so sure it may have been loosely connected to the movies it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it br br it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents in the 1st episode i believe and the amount of parents were disappointing with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies you'd expect there to be more parents but oh well br br freddy is basically the narrator for the show he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved br br the acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie i heard it was canceled due to <UNK> parents i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone 4 more movies came after the series so it wasn't a total loss

<START> once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who <UNK> and the whole of <UNK> was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who <UNK> as soon as it was announced that the doctor s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone <UNK> their heads and <UNK> who is eric roberts i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume but one helpful soul wrote into a <UNK> i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham the film was called by the sword and was about a <UNK> school actually looking back now roberts is best known for the <UNK> of <UNK> village and runaway train but that <UNK> t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern <UNK> was going to a <UNK> strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who <UNK> a great many fans myself among them thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production br br yeah i m <UNK> but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i d heard the name of eric roberts but i <UNK> t get the chance to see it <UNK> this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it i know nothing about <UNK> everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not i don t fence so i don t know how accurate it all is but as mentioned the film feels somewhat <UNK> even if you saw it on its release in 1991 the <UNK> seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it <UNK> t have worked a lot better if it d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max <UNK> and alexander <UNK> being off centre for most of the film but i <UNK> t convinced about their love hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword
<START> i really liked tom <UNK> <UNK> you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts and don't expect anything it's like sitting on a <UNK> <UNK> with a beer in the summer sun and watching the people go by it definitely won't keep you <UNK> afterwards that's true but that's not a <UNK> for a good film it's just the experience during the movie that's great br br i felt there were a few <UNK> that could have been worked out a little more but being a lynch fan i don't care that much anymore br br and i loved the style or flair of this movie it's slick but fresh and the soundtrack is a beauty any music lover will get his kicks out of <UNK> i can assure you br br i'll give it 8 out 10 br br music wise 10 out of 10
<START> i only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with opening night and that's <UNK> s persona both movies are simply amazing they have a <UNK> of ideas hard to grasp at first sight we have a profound <UNK> on the relation of art and life as one actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to the accidental death of one of her fans a young girl that declares her love for myrtle and she is then hit by a car leaves a deep mark in the actress she starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol but that doesn't help to much and myrtle is one step away from complete madness the scene where she kill the imaginary or not spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes i found in a <UNK> film the movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and gena rowlands <UNK> a scene since myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately this scene was filmed <UNK> with a live audience the laughter is genuine the chemistry between <UNK> and rowlands absolutely amazing if you liked persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine
<START> i think <UNK> the <UNK> is the best one of the series br br <UNK> all the episodes are funny personally i really like the episode with the <UNK> <UNK> but the one with the <UNK> actors in <UNK> is also really funny the way <UNK> keeps playing on with them is really english humor at the highest level br br actors <UNK> say that again always call it the scottish play <UNK> oh so you want me to say the scottish play actors yes <UNK> rather than <UNK> br br i am a big fan of <UNK> and i have the majority of his work but i think he did the series of <UNK> especially good br br i hope <UNK> is going to continue his great style but i think we can count on him because he is already working on a bean 2 movie that will be out this year i can't wait br br i give this 3rd <UNK> a 9 out of 10 rating
<START> if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures do not worry about it it would be <UNK> along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like family planning br br it was co produced with <UNK> to teach pre teen girls about <UNK> <UNK> it only <UNK> at a superficial level so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated <UNK> head <UNK> system sequence br br the film does show the wonderful world of disney elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story br br this film is impossible to find so if you can find the film best luck to you and enjoy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> paramount pulled out all the stops for this <UNK> stage adaptation entry big budget large cast <UNK> production and mitch <UNK> <UNK> as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didn't work for the out of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of <UNK> hands since the great duke <UNK> number is <UNK> chopped but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look the <UNK> <UNK> number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind <UNK> considering the <UNK> production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a <UNK> hot for an otherwise <UNK> jack <UNK> carl <UNK> acting is bland as <UNK> <UNK> but he's a competent singer <UNK> reaches for new <UNK> as a stereotypical dumb detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a 7 0 as a curiosity <UNK> <UNK> re think i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to <UNK> the lack of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand <UNK> argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the <UNK> major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history <UNK> speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out <UNK> search for beauty a must see for pre code buffs
<START> no laughs whatsoever yes i watched this entire train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if <UNK> had come to his senses in the latter part no he had not br br this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there to see that british humor included black jokes like these thirty years ago br br what <UNK> me even more though is to read the other <UNK> comments which acknowledge this isn't very good yet then turn around and give it high votes if the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one then i certainly pity your <UNK> <UNK> br br the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids yet the subject matter does not so who is this for people who enjoy repeated drawn out double takes <UNK> drug jokes interesting only as a short trip back to <UNK> and other low humor the three stooges are still funny and were to me as a kid too they <UNK> some effort in making jokes work this however is <UNK> off schlock i fear that it is the end of civilization if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile next you'll be telling me that <UNK> tv is popular
<START> the first half of this movie is a pure delight novel funny wonderful performances a close <UNK> brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman adult bright witty what more could you ask as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing it heads into <UNK> territory and then it falls apart br br it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming of age coming out of the closet story that has been done many times before what a disappointment as a people film it begins with such promise why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian i am who i am film the freeze frame ending shot of heather <UNK> jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself <UNK> the <UNK> of the last part of the film br br it could have been different it could have been magical it ended up being the same old same old
<START> no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that here's a few different <UNK> on it from one of those religious nuts as one <UNK> reviewer puts it so <UNK> br br 1 baby face 1933 offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film look cute bat your <UNK> offer your body for free and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want br br in this case it was job <UNK> with the ultimate goal of money lots of it at least four men in this film do provide just that even if it ruins their lives in the process br br 2 the ending which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate gives another great message all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel <UNK> a sad comment that so many critics here would rather have <UNK> messages <UNK> sleaze over substance no surprise i guess br br any way you look at it the movie is entertaining start to finish and stanwyck has some great lines particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his <UNK> bar customers at a little over 70 minutes this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it
<START> poor tobe hopper he directed an all time horror classic texas <UNK> massacre since then everything he's done has been horrible this is probably the worst and that's saying a lot it's about a man brad <UNK> who has the ability to make things and people catch fire or something like that hardly an original idea anyone remember <UNK> it's a real mess literally everything is done wrong pathetic acting even <UNK> <UNK> script <UNK> production values crappy special effects everything is bad a must miss not even good for laughs
<START> this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me <UNK> made this movie is <UNK> to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid <UNK> unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from <UNK> i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but <UNK> for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by <UNK> perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
<START> in new orleans an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the <UNK> criminal <UNK> walter jack palance he is chased by <UNK> and his men raymond <UNK> zero mostel and <UNK> guy <UNK> killed by <UNK> and his body is dumped in the sea during the <UNK> the family man lieutenant commander dr <UNK> reed richard widmark of the u s public health service finds that the dead man had <UNK> plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty eight hours to avoid an <UNK> the city mayor <UNK> the skeptical captain tom warren paul douglas to help dr clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and <UNK> them br br panic in the streets <UNK> a simple story but it is still effective and with a great villain the engaging plot has not become dated after fifty seven years jack palance performs a despicable <UNK> in his debut and the camera work while he tries to escape with zero mostel is still very impressive my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> panic in the streets
<START> this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have <UNK> her later career on <UNK> style that could be <UNK> zany beauty <UNK> direction is light but sure handed the story is a <UNK> of course but the acting is <UNK> contemporary and the star watching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a <UNK> jerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br
<START> i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid i <UNK> <UNK> really early one morning started watching hbo and the raft segment 2 <UNK> me good this time around i still enjoyed the raft although i couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short the other two segments were complete trash i can't believe a producer somewhere <UNK> to make this junk all i've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory <UNK> 2 will now join <UNK> among my list of <UNK> childhood classics 4 10
<START> i'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe i'm not part of the same universe because if <UNK> mars is anything it's over the top in a big way br br the acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through that's not what i call real br br it is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut off from reality rob thomas and his staff are br br overall i found it to be at best a <UNK> fest and at worst more than a little annoying <UNK> bell looks like she could be a good actress but it's hard to tell with the over the top style of the whole show
<START> being an elvis fan i can't understand how this <UNK> could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on <UNK> grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in 1958 and these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike <UNK> is funny specially as an <UNK> the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis sucks overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you <UNK> ho <UNK> instead of this mess
<START> a bug's life is a very good animated feature this movie is for younger children but it is also a great movie for people my age the story is about an <UNK> named <UNK> he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior <UNK> he gets <UNK> and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's the story is good but a little more detail would be suffice the voice acting is good as with most animation movies the music is nice to listen to nothing special but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories overall this movie struck me as <UNK> this is a good movie for all families i rate this movie 10 10
<START> the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i don't think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's the subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in <UNK> i think this <UNK> true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didn't stay for the q a either br br i don't think <UNK> really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didn't get <UNK> carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq <UNK> about what was he thinking i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private <UNK> life for <UNK> character car it didn't work it didn't even seem to make sense really br br the only good thing about this film was woody <UNK> he played his character car <UNK> you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br as for lauren lily and <UNK> boring br br don't see it it is painful unless you are a true <UNK> fan
<START> i'm a big fan of films where people get <UNK> and house of games is almost the <UNK> of the <UNK> where people get <UNK> genre in short it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what's happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this it's still difficult to guess where it's going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt <UNK> to a fellow <UNK> she then goes to the <UNK> in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con br br house of games <UNK> a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe <UNK> stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under <UNK> he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay <UNK> stars alongside him as the psychiatrist <UNK> by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest <UNK> but at least she can act the way that the film <UNK> it's plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to <UNK> and <UNK> the viewer at times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being <UNK> by the con men in the film another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride
<START> if you want to watch a real <UNK> movie get hold of the <UNK> formula this wondrous film must have cost all of 50 to make it features a <UNK> thin script <UNK> bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion paper <UNK> monster that is utterly laughable it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a <UNK> puppet for the monster but all were equally dreadful br br the actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a <UNK> the special effects are way beyond lousy and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title <UNK> <UNK> which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes br br this is what happens when you <UNK> the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the <UNK> that lies underneath br br i loved every minute of it
<START> well my goodness am i disappointed when i first heard news of a remake of robert <UNK> 1963 film the haunting i had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer movie sized visual effects but deep down i had faith surely with such a talented cast intact de <UNK> and company will not ruin a film who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety well subtlety where are you now my fears have <UNK> a promising movie has gone wrong yes <UNK> <UNK> production design is jaw dropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer jerry <UNK> can never ever do wrong but the script puts it's fine actors to the test asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies in the end the always wonderful <UNK> taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity and that's just barely but the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us we can no longer use our <UNK> feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown no we get some visual effects to show us what we're supposed to be afraid of and you know what as wonderfully realized as they are the visual effects come off as sort of silly and the climax is a <UNK> mess but things had gone terribly wrong long before that br br everything in the haunting is overdone and overblown i'm afraid there are no real thrills or <UNK> in this old haunted house monstrosity only <UNK> check out the original instead br br
<START> <UNK> i agree with the reviewer who said that strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film i thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it i think that was primarily because of <UNK> and <UNK> not the plot br br the bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically <UNK> on the one hand and profoundly <UNK> on the other thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter i'm not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda br br i thought the acting was mediocre a lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees <UNK> of reality i kept wanting to <UNK> some meaning from the plot but it's ultimately just a conversation with a mad man <UNK> i feel mildly sorry for him <UNK> because of his loss but not really his loss is no greater and certainly is less than <UNK> suffered every day around the world by more significant causes br br does the film expose <UNK> about hiv aids yes that of the intended audience is hiv a dark mysterious evil killer what about it's victims the answer to both questions is no neither hiv nor its victims have any more or less <UNK> intent than <UNK> multiple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cancer or their victims for god's sake just because a disease is <UNK> does not make it either deliberate or <UNK> or evil it just is br br does this excuse ignorance or fool hardy risk taking no should all people practice safe sex yes will safe sex save the world no is safe sex realistic in all instances of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings  of course not what kind of a world would we live in if everyone followed the rules no one ever took risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate am i ignoring that the film deals specifically with gay sex  yes hiv is spread by sharing blood or <UNK> <UNK> between infected and non infected individuals sex is not necessary for <UNK> gay or otherwise br br i'm always disturbed by <UNK> violence of one person upon another i actually thought the film did do a good job of portraying the absurdity of <UNK> violent <UNK> <UNK> and intent towards dan and this kind of insane violence does occur every day br br stream of consciousness notes from the film tom is crazy br br why doesn't dan ask why do you feel this way rather than what are you doing <UNK> men who have sex with men get aids <UNK> hiv aids where was <UNK> responsibility in the sex act why was it <UNK> responsibility to use the <UNK> maybe you slipped it off before you stuck it <UNK> what are we talking about here was one of the parties unconscious maybe she didn't want to hear the truth are you kidding me she's up in heaven and so unbelievably hurt about what she now knows about me <UNK> is <UNK> life over if he has hiv certainly not is this why the whole world is so <UNK> they think gay men are the cause of hiv that they will give it to the rest of the world and we will all <UNK> are you kidding me are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause is the problem do we feel that way about the victims of <UNK> of <UNK> i can see that tom is hurt because of his wife's death and he blames it on aids but <UNK> who's at fault here the victim or the virus are <UNK> really the responsibility of the ill <UNK> they did not seek and did not seek to spread the disease br br sure safe sex is essential to a safe life but so is not driving not flying not leaving the house not living do we really want to blame the disease on the victims would safe sex between tom and dan have prevented <UNK> wife's ultimate demise perhaps but not <UNK> sole responsibility br br tom is crazy did i mention that br br tom to dan maybe you get what you deserve  come on 24 days violent <UNK> and <UNK> br br am i <UNK> perhaps but i think this film points a judging finger at gay men for their reckless and <UNK> intent towards a straight world by practicing <UNK> sex when the rate of <UNK> practicing safe sex is <UNK> equivalent or better than that of <UNK> we all need to wake up and get serious about hiv aids hiv is killing hundreds of thousands of straight <UNK> every year
<START> the five deadly <UNK> is a great kung fu action movie wrapped in a <UNK> mystery there are all the usual <UNK> signs of a kung fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often <UNK> human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non fight scenes occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible injustice br br another thing i love about the five deadly <UNK> is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes just about everyone gets what's coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own <UNK> and <UNK> the good guys use <UNK> planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top br br poison clan rocks

<START> one <UNK> of a movie featuring a <UNK> plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total <UNK> of a jet aircraft and especially a <UNK> some of the major <UNK> br br 1 no flight engineer or even a flight engineer station 2 <UNK> <UNK> the f 16 <UNK> as f <UNK> no <UNK> whatsoever 3 <UNK> passengers into an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> supposedly <UNK> from the cabin even if such a <UNK> existed placing that much weight that far <UNK> would make the aircraft <UNK> 4 hollow point bullets that won't damage the aircraft 5 the entire landing <UNK> was so bad i wanted to <UNK> 6 an sr <UNK> of all planes with a pressure seal <UNK> 7 opening a cabin door <UNK> into the wind in flight br br ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year
<START> well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasn't even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public <UNK> i am guessing br br <UNK> despite her glory awards and reputation is a <UNK> british gal who can't sing or dance or act br br some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert <UNK> <UNK> husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was <UNK> popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here br br only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing
<START> this film <UNK> itself from the run of the mill wonder of the human body documentaries by <UNK> if <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera <UNK> in on a gigantic 50 foot <UNK> as a teenager <UNK> <UNK> and fluid out of it in another the camera is <UNK> in a swamp of half <UNK> food and stomach acid as parts of a <UNK> <UNK> drop in from the <UNK> and <UNK> into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of teenage <UNK> hair unfortunately i'm not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don't have <UNK> <UNK> beforehand
<START> i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the <UNK> of the increasingly distant past pulled down by the weight of its under <UNK> along comes television at its best it has a <UNK> power and with <UNK> like those the bbc produce so finely victorian literature gets a new stab at life the religious themes the moral overtones may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked and <UNK> with <UNK> affairs and domestic violence but those old well told stories have enduring power and this is one's a hidden gem br br it's hard to <UNK> today just how <UNK> feminist and extraordinary ann <UNK> masterpiece the tenant of <UNK> hall actually was <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>  <UNK> mental societal  her heroine helen <UNK> escapes a miserable marriage <UNK> brutality and alcoholism <UNK> not only her abusive husband's fury but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> change in her life she pays a price but <UNK> her self respect she falls in love along the way she emerges <UNK> but <UNK> and strong i just love watching women like these on screen br br the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer the love story is beautifully handled with real passion and feeling by well matched actors tara fitzgerald <UNK> every aspect of the complicated heroine and as has been said here by other reviewers no less <UNK> defined and beautiful a face could survive that <UNK> <UNK> toby <UNK> striking sparks off her contributes just the right combination of <UNK> handsome youth and passionate yearning vulnerability rupert graves one of my favourite british actors ever enjoys himself as the charismatic villain so much so that you're almost with him at the end no one's perfect the supporting cast <UNK> create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse <UNK> have been made to modern tastes and without having felt <UNK> to another bbc classic highly recommended this is how romantic literature should be <UNK>
<START> after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted 2 hours of my life that's 2 hours i'll never get back ugh when you start this you might think wow this is really good but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen this movie is simply pathetic the acting is bland the story line is anything but original and there's nothing especially unique about this except that it's the worst movie ever do not watch this movie warning dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste 2 hours of your life on this 1 10
<START> this film was amazing it is an inspiring piece of cinema the characters are fully developed through the truth in which director lucy walker brings to the film i highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition lucy <UNK> showcases the landscape beauty this film id a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs man the inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter the subject of how the <UNK> view <UNK> as a sign of demons is interesting this film <UNK> light on a particular culture that has never been <UNK> lucy walker has given <UNK> <UNK> a voice when he would have not normally been heard thank you lucy for being true to your <UNK> as a filmmaker
<START> this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace <UNK> lamas is really cool though all the characters are just annoying except lamas and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for plus the action is very boring the film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up plus it looks very cheap and amateurish <UNK> lamas has a lot of charisma but he can't save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button plus the dialog is especially laughable there is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once lamas heads to the <UNK> it all falls apart plus the scene where the villains torture <UNK> family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace <UNK> lamas is really cool though however it is not enough not recommended the direction is very bad george <UNK> does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace the acting is pretty bad except for lamas <UNK> lamas is awesome here and while he isn't required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he can't save this one and he had no chemistry with the cast either lamas rules <UNK> bell is terrible here and while she's decent looking she isn't very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas <UNK> <UNK> is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at that robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain and wasn't menacing at all he was laughable as were the other 2 rest of the cast are bad overall avoid avoid even if you do like lamas like me out of 5
<START> stage adaptations often have a major fault they often come out looking like a film camera was simply placed on the stage such as night mother sidney <UNK> direction keeps the film alive which is especially difficult since the picture offered him no real challenge still it's nice to look at for what it is the chemistry between michael caine and christopher reeve is quite brilliant the dynamics of their relationship are surprising caine is fantastic as always and reeve gets one of his few chances to really act br br i confess that i've never seen ira <UNK> play but i hear that jay <UNK> allen's adaptation is faithful the script is incredibly convoluted and keeps you guessing deathtrap is an enormously entertaining film and is recommended for nearly all fans of stage and screen br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a very mildly entertaining british movie about a german police <UNK> in the late 1950's who is haunted by the ghost of a jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under hitler in the ss the ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a jew to <UNK> for the murders he committed br br otto the german policeman actually knows this <UNK> name because the last thing he did before he died was said in <UNK> kiss my <UNK> the policeman didn't speak <UNK> so he asked around until he found the meaning the kiss my <UNK> left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the <UNK> name <UNK> <UNK> br br there are a bunch of men who are murdered in the <UNK> of the police <UNK> and there are no helpful clues the men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher the butcher <UNK> that his knives are missing while the <UNK> is in the store to get a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> so the <UNK> is a suspect the first man is killed while making love to the <UNK> wife so the butcher is a suspect but the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife all the men are killed immediately after the climax of <UNK> br br i think i might be a bit <UNK> than the ghost of <UNK> <UNK> if i was killed like he was he seems to be very good natured about it as if he was just in a mild car accident i can only guess that it is because it is a british movie and they are known for being a very polite people he uses some of his material from his stand up <UNK> and i just didn't find it very funny br br i gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was the movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from and it seemed that <UNK> should have been more helpful than he was the movie gave me a tiny look into jewish culture but was only skin deep do all jews love <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> do they all say <UNK> and <UNK> in their daily <UNK> isn't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture br br i saw this movie at a jewish community center in berkeley <UNK> and i was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white i have no gray or white hair there were 18 of us and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie there were 2 main concerns expressed there 1 the movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 as the holocaust survivors are dying off future generations will not know what really happened i thought that this second concern was ridiculous and i told them i thought they didn't need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies like myself the murder of 6 000 000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten i write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day
<START> this movie isn't as bad as i heard it was enjoyable funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection it will be a movie to watch every year after <UNK> to get me in the mood for the best time of the year i heard that ben's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time take it for what is it a christmas comedy with a love twist i enjoyed it no it isn't titanic and it won't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two so go laugh and have a good time
<START> posh spice victoria beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to la for work purposes <UNK> <UNK> david is now a galaxy la player after his transfer from real <UNK> was originally going to be a full series but was thankfully <UNK> to just one hour or so but even in this form it is still numbingly interminable br br like virtually all <UNK> tv shows most of the incident comes across as blatantly <UNK> with the programme itself even <UNK> that <UNK> newly <UNK> personal assistant is an actress an ugly betty <UNK> we hear some <UNK> written and performed banter early on with an obvious joke about <UNK> apparent <UNK> with a previous and rather more glamorous <UNK> rebecca <UNK> though her name is not mentioned with further sequences involving a fake blow up doll to trick the <UNK> and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball br br this could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff and had an actress or <UNK> in the lead role talented <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would've been perfect and is better at being posh than posh herself is and if this more sensible decision had been taken much more fun and amusement would've <UNK> sadly we are left with the real thing here ms <UNK> may have rejected the script as too weak anyway and although there are odd scattered attempts at self <UNK> and irony it never remotely works because of prior info of la <UNK> considerable wealth beforehand and her non ability at delivering would be jokes despite the intentions to send up her image mrs beckham comes across as a shallow <UNK> and her weak one liners don't <UNK> us she has any humorous self awareness i suspect that if a more realistic fly on the wall documentary approach had been taken namely posh walking down any street in la and being totally ignored instead of the frantic staged scenes of mild <UNK> on show here and associates making <UNK> <UNK> about the previously mentioned ms <UNK> this would've made <UNK> better tv but being <UNK> <UNK> material the <UNK> one herself would never allow such events to happen br br having said that the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was <UNK> presented in front of an <UNK> crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in hollywood her colleague scary spice aka mel brown also found it impossible to make it big <UNK> in the movie capital despite her affair which was not <UNK> with big name eddie murphy br br the spice girls were of course a <UNK> successful <UNK> pop group in the mid 1990's more so in their native britain but still popular briefly in other countries including the us they were certainly good fun at their peak of glory 1997 when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the uk with cool <UNK> and a new <UNK> government which the spice girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time even if it was somewhat <UNK> but they were never outstanding musical or singing talents and uk optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year the starting point was arguably the tragic death of princess diana as did the <UNK> themselves their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye <UNK> with dignity to enjoy their <UNK> then we would have all had pleasant memories <UNK> on our mind without any guilt unfortunately the <UNK> of the hideous <UNK> culture in the uk towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those <UNK> and we have all suffered thousands if not millions of stories about the <UNK> since posh being the worst <UNK> with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind it was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon which is <UNK> as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any <UNK> to their <UNK> bank accounts maybe it's because two of them are struggling single mothers perhaps br br good it's soon time for <UNK> adventures on a <UNK> documentary next i can hardly wait br br rating 2 out of 10
<START> a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and <UNK> visual imagination knows no <UNK> every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury <UNK> the <UNK> to heaven to hold court over peter david niven 's operation br br all of the performances are spot on roger <UNK> being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i haven't seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack <UNK> cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim <UNK> face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table <UNK> look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound <UNK> at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time br br this is a true classic that can <UNK> anyone's faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 10 10 in a word beautiful
<START> the garden of <UNK> is a prime example of popular women's literature turn of the <UNK> century style combining all the power of <UNK> erotic and exotic <UNK> with the stimulating <UNK> of fake <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> bite of catholic guilt just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was <UNK> <UNK> for his sins or the heroine of rebecca couldn't find true <UNK> in her marriage until her <UNK> husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife and her castle burned down around her or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to <UNK> <UNK> secret at all costs <UNK> the <UNK> catholic heroine of this piece of tripe can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has <UNK> his sacred religious <UNK> like all such <UNK> aiming to <UNK> the female reader and <UNK> the <UNK> this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book basic <UNK> and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be <UNK> in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in <UNK> in the last act it is paul <UNK> reduced to beauty <UNK> magazine standards oh well it could have been much worse and it often was br br without the religious overtones the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick <UNK> monk driven mad by <UNK> escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the <UNK> with a romantic <UNK> but naive catholic <UNK> before <UNK> his monastery all passion spent leaving her to clean up his mess and i really <UNK> another <UNK> comparison with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual <UNK> some of which <UNK> in <UNK> opera of the same name thankfully br br but what makes this picture unique in the <UNK> of commercial female <UNK> of course is the enormous <UNK> of talents gathered under one <UNK> to make this cinematic wet dream come to <UNK> vibrant life <UNK> technicolor photography that will <UNK> us all a <UNK> of worthy character actors including one cute dog a music score by max <UNK> that seems determined to accomplish the composed film that michael powell who ironically had a bit part in the <UNK> silent version always <UNK> about <UNK> at times on the brink of <UNK> but always coming through in splendid <UNK> operatic <UNK> a dream like atmosphere where material <UNK> are no object characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next dialog is sparse vague and suggestive the art direction is close to <UNK> flower <UNK> appear in the <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> the <UNK> wardrobe is <UNK> and all the male characters are either <UNK> saints doomed but horny <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> br br <UNK> hollywood the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable the bit rate is very high throughout the colour <UNK> is almost always perfect and the 2 0 <UNK> sound truly does justice to max <UNK> score and to <UNK> <UNK> confession br br a historical note on this sort of women's subject the following year <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> inspired by the garden of <UNK> directed <UNK> de <UNK> where a very similar clothes horse <UNK> won't melt in her mouth heroine widowed after taking care of an <UNK> husband in the exotic <UNK> of some <UNK> romantic <UNK> <UNK> villa wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book she finds them all in time only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her <UNK> and herself were either misunderstood <UNK> or else had <UNK> tragic consequences it was <UNK> cynical way of telling us to beware of <UNK> idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later
<START> i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and <UNK> of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> etc would have willingly <UNK> in this farce but maybe in 1968 people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american <UNK> priest with an agenda there is a <UNK> conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a <UNK> <UNK> the priest then promptly becomes the <UNK> by a series of <UNK> we are allowed to see the secret <UNK> <UNK> voting process which is portrayed in the most <UNK> <UNK> form you can possibly imagine br br meanwhile the <UNK> in china achieved the usual <UNK> economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor <UNK> on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to <UNK> <UNK> the western <UNK> <UNK> to the poor workers of china br br our good old <UNK> general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the <UNK> just before his <UNK> to ask him to <UNK> peace they meet with the chinese leader <UNK> <UNK> who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like <UNK> <UNK> demands that the western <UNK> must pay which is quite logical after all don't <UNK> always have to pay for the madness of the <UNK> and that the <UNK> needs to sacrifice something too for the common <UNK> cause of <UNK> and social justice br br so when the <UNK> gets <UNK> in rome he <UNK> the entire wealth of the catholic church world wide to feed our poor chinese <UNK> in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust br br apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie i'd give it three oscars for stupidity br br by the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a <UNK> he is much more plausible as <UNK> the greek
<START> this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly <UNK> you truly see the depths and <UNK> of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it
<START> the blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a true work of art the narration by sir michael redgrave is moving the length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or tv video time <UNK>
<START> this is a great canadian comedy series the movie tells of how the stars jean paul <UNK> julian and the head writer of the show and his buddies <UNK> and <UNK> play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the <UNK> of said trashy <UNK> the movie will tell you why <UNK> and julian begin doing their more advanced <UNK> into the world of crime why and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so i shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant <UNK> their friend and <UNK> time partner <UNK> is a brilliant character the whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit com one bit it is a comedy with a capital c and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams if you ever have the opportunity to watch buy steal this program grab it you will be glad you did and to my american friends it will break you up also 10 out of 9 brilliant tv how tv should be
<START> had the original casting idea been kept hunting <UNK> not ice t this movie might have worked sadly racism had to come into the picture literally and mess it up the <UNK> black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black so they <UNK> <UNK> and ice <UNK> roles this was only the start of the <UNK> spiral of this film ernest <UNK> news room approach to <UNK> only <UNK> that this was another <UNK> action job assignment master shot close up close up <UNK> <UNK> line is it <UNK> even uses more creative camera work <UNK> rewrite of 'the most dangerous <UNK> is at least an attempt at <UNK> the classic tale but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this we are never given the reasons other than no one will miss these people why the leader re written as <UNK> does these things aside from a heart felt performance by john <UNK> and a fair job by charles <UNK> do not bother with this one one small bit of trivia there was a real drunk driving accident during filming that injured f murray abraham and resulted in the death of the <UNK> young driver that caused the accident
<START> one of the more <UNK> lone stars with time spent on character development and interaction dialog and acting business the opening scene sets the stage literally for the personalities of the <UNK> kansas charlie eddy chandler and his buddy john scott john wayne the <UNK> say <UNK> day oh star both of whom are slightly randy the film follows their adventures as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican <UNK> and later in their pursuit of <UNK> mary <UNK> who has the inevitable evil brother though he'd been led <UNK> by the real villain and wants to <UNK> and oh of course they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being <UNK> at the end br br the high point is scott continually and deliberately <UNK> <UNK> butt in her <UNK> store and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western but it sounds better than it actually is br br sadly the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here no <UNK> <UNK> cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses no george hayes tedious <UNK> like <UNK> play between scott and charlie with charlie swinging at scott scott <UNK> on his foot and then <UNK> him repeated two more times the skilled paul fix is underused eddy chandler himself here in his big star turn is not really believable as a randy side kick the villain looks too old and fat so does chandler who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited <UNK> mary <UNK> of the <UNK> our gang see <UNK> queen of <UNK> <UNK> is cute in her scenes with john wayne but that's about it for this one <UNK> of a better western lie buried here br br p s the ultra short <UNK> version which looks good moves along so fast it's over if you blink more than once thankfully though the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut
<START> <UNK> this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't i mean you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind br br to be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers br br the death scenes are horrible <UNK> stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from 1991 br br to make things even worse this isn't a movie so bad that it's good it's just plain bad br br molly <UNK> tried to do her best but it wasn't enough
<START> there are many police dramas doing the rounds i am not sure why it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil br br this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult <UNK> of anne a raw <UNK> into a police squad <UNK> in the <UNK> area no attempt is made to <UNK> the police they are truly down to earth harsh at times and <UNK> anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition against all rules she sometimes holds back <UNK> information found on her strip <UNK> and other <UNK> br br this is not a pleasant film not one to relax you there is not much feeling of optimism in it the police seem to be involved in a losing battle tomorrow there will be more <UNK> more murders more family break ups and more <UNK> children let's face it this is the world we live in br br as days go by anne becomes more <UNK> involved with the police and with the families they are investigating the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family anne has her own way of <UNK> things up she turns a blind eye to <UNK> <UNK> and tries to help him as best she can i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce <UNK> father it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children br br well cast but not my idea of an <UNK> entertainment
<START> a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been <UNK> over women according to <UNK> law one can well imagine the difficulty of <UNK> <UNK> legal rights for women and children after 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the <UNK> began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these <UNK> stories br br the leaders of this legal <UNK> movement are vera <UNK> a state <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot <UNK> though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent <UNK> of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the <UNK> also play themselves in the film br br two cases involve repeated wife beating with <UNK> sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated <UNK> of a child age 8 by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the <UNK> of the trials the <UNK> in each case are <UNK> to the women and children the <UNK> receive stiff prison terms and or <UNK> the divorce is granted br br the aggressive <UNK> of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to <UNK> the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms <UNK> also co directed the 1998 film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in <UNK> in broken english with english subtitles my grade b 8 10
<START> this is the worst thing the <UNK> franchise has ever <UNK> i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was <UNK> even though i liked the original cartoon br br there's this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his <UNK> what <UNK> questions are it's atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me so much so that i didn't even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it's miserably forgettable br br the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it <UNK> ninja
<START> there's a major difference between releasing an original intense edge of your seat scary gore fest and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with cabin fever and simply acted like it the film follows five college <UNK> into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other <UNK> to this mysterious fast acting flesh eating disease it's not long before the friends turn on one another and can barely stand the sight of one another much less want to be in the same <UNK> as them as gross as it all sounds there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable <UNK> more <UNK> a hackneyed script so profanity laden as to leave the viewer <UNK> out the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that <UNK> little more than in one instance an on screen appearance by director roth this is sloppy film making in several ways avoid this time <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gandhi my father a film that <UNK> light on the <UNK> relationship between the <UNK> and his son harilal gandhi for a story that's as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell it's a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school now the film aims to convey one very interesting point the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father this point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that <UNK> to england which gandhi twice <UNK> his son instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing <UNK> harilal feels towards his father which is why when we finally see an <UNK> from harilal it comes off looking like he's over <UNK> br br the point i'm trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did we never really understand why he turned to islam and then back again to <UNK> the thing is we never really understand harilal at all and that's because the director of this film is too busy focusing on <UNK> <UNK> gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with to put it simply gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father son relationship but it doesn't so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being <UNK> son but show us why that was a burden to begin with show us incidents of their early conflict for example it's not enough that gandhi merely says he's opposed to <UNK> early marriage tell us why this opposition it's not enough that <UNK> blames her husband for the way her son turned out for constantly <UNK> him between schools in <UNK> and south africa for making him <UNK> every time gandhi needed to <UNK> words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi what's more instead of sticking with the <UNK> theme of this <UNK> gandhi versus gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many <UNK> thus <UNK> the impact of the central theme this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence and yet on many occasions that's exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost <UNK> to take us through all the main events leading <UNK> that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the film's basic premise the <UNK> father son relationship so you see the problem with this film is not that it's a bad film but it's certainly a very confused film what happens to <UNK> children after his wife's death does he ever have relationship with them where do they suddenly <UNK> after that one scene in which we see them with the <UNK> and <UNK> none of these questions are answered in a film that's basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family the film version of an immensely popular play directed by <UNK> <UNK> khan himself gandhi my father is a disappointment no questions asked <UNK> it struggles to translate the <UNK> ambitious intention to the screen practically every single scene in the film opens and <UNK> with fade ins and fade outs never quite <UNK> leading into each other on the positive side there is inherent <UNK> in the film which you <UNK> the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain what the film does do however is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult <UNK> whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently <UNK> his family of all the actors in the film it's only <UNK> <UNK> who really shines in the role of the luck <UNK> harilal gandhi it's a wonderful performance and it's not easy since the role covers virtually the entire <UNK> of the character but <UNK> brings a rare <UNK> of innocence and <UNK> to that part and succeeds in making harilal a <UNK> figure just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife's dead and you'll realise how much he conveys through body language alone <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile who plays gandhi senior <UNK> a <UNK> approach to playing the <UNK> in his later years but it's the way he <UNK> the man in his early years as a <UNK> in south africa that is the actor's best contribution to that role the <UNK> gifted <UNK> shah plays <UNK> the woman who's meant to be torn in this father son conflict but if she's unable to bring across that feeling of <UNK> then it's really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a <UNK> script much <UNK> gone into the making of this film and that's evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you'll remember about it when you leave the cinema it's just so boring director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much <UNK> screenplay what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy and with this film the director makes us too
<START> now don't get me wrong i do enjoy christmas movies i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c scott and <UNK> <UNK> but this particular movie is awful i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful albert finney sings fairly well in annie i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a <UNK> of dead <UNK> the only thing that saved this movie for us was <UNK> the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd
<START> every once in a while someone out of the blue looks at me a little <UNK> and asks what's with <UNK> i know immediately they have a case of barely hidden amusement horror you see i was the cinematographer on the film br br let me <UNK> some points regarding this interesting life experience br br originally <UNK> was called one hard hit i met james <UNK> in july of 1999 a day after i wrapped triangle square a great little <UNK> feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival <UNK> it fell eternal victim to the fine print of <UNK> notorious experimental feature contract but i <UNK> br br i though i was on a roll and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in <UNK> with a shooting budget of about 25 000 not wanting to break pace i took it after all <UNK> el <UNK> i too believed the myth back then br br let's just <UNK> it up as film school for many involved myself included <UNK> was shot over two weeks in august 1999 in <UNK> <UNK> and santa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> taught drama at a high school in the latter city yes he is a drama and english teacher consider that while watching the film or even <UNK> the use of <UNK> in title hence the locations and cast br br of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l a 's channel 2 morning news weather girl vera <UNK> and of greater impact the debut of eva longoria who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt i must say her professional dedication focus and let's do this attitude kept me inspired and was a <UNK> of her stardom yet to come br br <UNK> suffered from poor <UNK> few lights or electricity several boom <UNK> du <UNK> and delivery of an <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> none of that <UNK> the actual content which speaks for itself br br anyway by 2003 the film was sold to <UNK> at a net loss i understand who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box by then she was a rising working name but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to <UNK> since <UNK> other passion is <UNK> book dealing it appears to confirm he believes you can in fact judge a book by it's cover as so many have picked up this dvd based on it's <UNK> one year later eva now on a soap and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had <UNK> split second which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent br br 6 years later i was hired to shoot another <UNK> film titled <UNK> mexico i though he had worked out the process my participation was <UNK> on casting script and crew control and the <UNK> film actually looked promising in <UNK> for what it was a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in <UNK> despite claims here and elsewhere the film has never appeared in any festival or <UNK> although <UNK> has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to <UNK> with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject virgin of <UNK> and border town
<START> contrary to my principles let me first come up with a conclusion because i have just seen this piece of art and still am under strong impressions the reader is asked to excuse my stronger <UNK> br br well this movie is absolutely horrible and i would never bother to write a single word about it if it were not for the fact that <UNK> minutes made me sick to death which rarely happens to me the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here br br so what is wrong with the movie it has a <UNK> title <UNK> minutes one first thinks about 15 minutes which is by the way a much better movie but still bad in my book and indeed the two can be compared to some extent but as luck would have it the things they share are their worst characteristics they both feature mr <UNK> <UNK> who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind ah do we miss the good old times now i don't imply that he is a bad actor i am yet to judge his true performance but he is simply not a true individual here he is more like an <UNK> how anyone can still <UNK> in such things is completely beyond my <UNK> we can recognize modern american <UNK> here the point in the movie when <UNK> explains to his companion that <UNK> are not germans and that they are in america is truly laughable are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become true americans br br then there is the media issue yes it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras interviews and <UNK> the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed <UNK> minutes instead he <UNK> us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show trying to <UNK> the wheel in 15 minutes the issue of media is the central one the point is presented in a way a teacher <UNK> an <UNK> student but that deserves a separate comment we are focusing on <UNK> minutes now so i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie what is it to provide good time for the audience to <UNK> weapons to <UNK> police portray violence oh yes the officer gives the bible to the <UNK> <UNK> so it must promote peace and understanding after all i don't think so but don't ask me i only know i didn't enjoy any of this br br ah michael madsen i admit i am a big fan i hoped he would be a bright point but i was wrong it's not his fault though br br as the final note comparing <UNK> to <UNK> at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard br br to <UNK> on the scale 1 10 i give it a pure <UNK> 1
<START> since their nasty divorce from the disney company with disney keeping the <UNK> brand the <UNK> company seems to <UNK> in above average movies which are then under promoted and seen by few the flock is a prime example br br a story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of <UNK> sex <UNK> this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of law and order <UNK> br br richard gere gives his best ever performance as the soft spoken agent worn out by the task claire danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in and she makes the most of playing the <UNK> the cinematography pacing editing all of it is first rate and i saw no trace of the attention <UNK> disorder camera jump around or excess camera cuts that others complained about the subject is handled with restraint but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick br br fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes <UNK> shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded then came the supreme court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the rights of sex <UNK> were opened up and america was turned into a <UNK> paradise for sexual <UNK> both willing and unwilling each such step was met with praise by <UNK> who celebrated the warren <UNK> ill deeds with glossy covers on time and <UNK> everyday <UNK> also praised the <UNK> action and <UNK> those who disagree in 2007 how many americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women can be <UNK> to and delivery of it is <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> rate by the us post office just one part of the problem a problem that can <UNK> anyone's family to <UNK> br br richard gere is a liberal but he gives his best in his performance here perhaps in his <UNK> age he's gained a measure of wisdom
<START> i liked the quiet noir of the first part the acting of pacino and <UNK> especially their scenes together the <UNK> of the setting and the <UNK> of the old <UNK> and the idealistic youth was <UNK> i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie she was an earnest and appealing character the film went off the <UNK> for me when the assistant mayor starting <UNK> around the <UNK> to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him <UNK> in nobody in their right mind would meet a <UNK> on an abandoned <UNK> in a <UNK> here the story became implausible something that i don't understand why did the cop and <UNK> have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge
<START> another good <UNK> short christine <UNK> is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one she is such a great actress the stooges are very good and especially <UNK> and larry this to is a good one to watch around <UNK> time
<START> the secret of kells is a film i've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in <UNK> i'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait the cartoons are heavily <UNK> but not annoyingly so as i'd feared the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination i particularly love the animated <UNK> book where the little figures come to life on the page the characterisation is superb i love brendan <UNK> voice as the stern <UNK> and i especially liked the voice of the <UNK> <UNK> the forest is a triumph such a beautiful place the story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect <UNK> for the book i'm a lover of <UNK> and <UNK> anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people i know who've seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it's a lovely little film i will definitely buy the dvd when it's released and would like to say well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this <UNK> project may there be many more coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas everyone loves it and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars such a joy to see this nominated
<START> this comedy is bound to be good from the get go east meets west and east doesn't want to lose west doesn't know what losing is like it starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go this is definitely worth seeing
<START> this adaptation of pearl s <UNK> film is certainly a classic a true hollywood epic it has all the things a great hollywood film has birth death happiness sadness <UNK> despair and so on there is only one thing that <UNK> me i know it was a sign of the times but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors paul muni was a great actor and he does an admirable job as wang lung the owner of a farm in china <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> she does not even look chinese i think she tried to get the role but they should have put anna may wong in the role i know why they didn't and ms <UNK> is very good in the film but they hardly tried to make her look authentic <UNK> its a great film especially if you read the book i did in high school decades ago its a must see just look beyond the casting i think you can
<START> i don't remember the last time i <UNK> to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin <UNK> in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of <UNK> timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in <UNK> or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the point br br timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben <UNK> acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian <UNK> or dame <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> read <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and emotional expressions which <UNK> from something like the 25 cliché expressions for actors he <UNK> the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned <UNK> for justice journalist it simply will not fly br br however timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary <UNK> and i'm surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake br br there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is <UNK> in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air br br but enough of timberlake bashing words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very run of the mill corruption story it's plot <UNK> from cliché to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> or maybe even <UNK> don't get me wrong edison is not even in the same <UNK> as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through it br br the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent <UNK> but any conversation between <UNK> <UNK> who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a <UNK> creek episode it's your typical far too <UNK> for reality let's impress the audience with how well we <UNK> and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is <UNK> by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like edison wants to <UNK> into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not <UNK> through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and <UNK> film <UNK> read slow motion br br thinking about it edison is a curiosity it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different <UNK> forced into one incoherent picture and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
<START> simply the best <UNK> film that i have ever seen although it is made by a <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold a national treasure that belongs to the republic of <UNK> but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries such as <UNK> became independent now the conditions may be better in most of those countries but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance and many of them still do at least on some level br br <UNK> <UNK> is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well written script the actors are also very good especially <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the best known <UNK> actor plays <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life but the most astonishing performance comes from <UNK> <UNK> a child actor playing <UNK> a <UNK> girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is quite essential and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb credit list w br br there are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time but <UNK> <UNK> does that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> other films are far from this kind of achievements his first one <UNK> <UNK> was too artificial and his latest history is made at night was just a weird mess
<START> documentaries of this kind are often very <UNK> this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat <UNK> the film <UNK> <UNK> made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as <UNK> for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country br br i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat <UNK> and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling it was a great very informative movie and i'd recommend anyone see it it kinda opens your eyes
<START> might not consider this having a spoiler but i'd rather be <UNK> than <UNK> i never saw this movie when i was little i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter i can watch it over and over again br br for the little acting <UNK> woods did in her lifetime she was a wonderful voice for cinderella very appealing very believable the music really fit the movie perfectly the acting was great loved the mice you really hated lady <UNK> and the step sisters they were just awful the <UNK> depicted the spoiled behavior very well br br this is a wonderful movie especially if you are into love stories my daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end
<START> most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid and some of them the blob included scared the <UNK> outta me movies like <UNK> from mars made it all too clear to us small <UNK> that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things <UNK> the <UNK> the blob just <UNK> that fact i recall <UNK> late <UNK> spent stretched on the floor watching as body <UNK> and martian <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into an unsuspecting society there was a summer in the early 1980s when a local science museum in <UNK> virginia ran an atomic age classic every weekend these were <UNK> films and most were black and white and the <UNK> was <UNK> and the color print of the blob had faded to a faint pink but man was it fun i dragged my mother along and she enjoyed it as much as i did it was there at that science museum that i truly fell in love with the blob the <UNK> intent was of course to make money but it was the sincerity of all involved from the filmmakers to the talent the players that made me fall in love with this movie corny you bet cheesy they don't get any <UNK> but man what a movie
<START> those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of <UNK> trapped rooms paranoia bad acting this one is a bit different though roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube or at least five of them br br i guess cube zero <UNK> to explain what the deal with the cube is but you really don't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films sure there's sort of an explanation in there but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film br br cube zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only <UNK> this feeling i also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the <UNK> future they have brought back the traps from cube 1 though by that i mean that they're almost the same ones which is a bit of a shame br br i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one but i just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with 1 10
<START> by my <UNK> aid <UNK> remark i mean that these are such devoted fans of the man pavarotti that they make no attempt to <UNK> rate this film giving this a 10 is akin to giving <UNK> cox the award for mr universe or putting a <UNK> elvis painting in the <UNK> when this film <UNK> i remember the savage reviews with <UNK> such as no <UNK> and some said it was among the worst films ever made this is definitely <UNK> it as well while bad and far from a great work of art there was a lot to like about the film and the movie's biggest <UNK> was not the acting of pavarotti nor his <UNK> br br believe it or not the <UNK> of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers who i believe were <UNK> it is rare to see a movie with such clichéd dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight but even they aren't the heart of the problem the problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middle aged man and a seemingly desperate lady perhaps european audiences might be more <UNK> of this but in the united states in 1982 or today such a romance seems sleazy and selfish especially when pavarotti tells <UNK> that he loves his wife and this is just fun wow talk about romantic dialog sadly if they had just changed the script a little bit and made pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic hollywood films such as from all this and heaven too or the suspect where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her instead she's the loving mother of two kids who waits <UNK> at home while her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> right and left as pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting <UNK> br br sadly even the gorgeous music of pavarotti couldn't save this film towards the end of the film there are some amazing scenes in new york where the set is just incredible and <UNK> singing <UNK> for that reason i think the movie at least deserves a 3 i really wanted to like the film more but it was a truly bad film though not quite as rotten as you might have heard br br sadly from what i have read this film might be a case of art imitating life as <UNK> own life later had some parallels to this film though this isn't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail
<START> david <UNK> follow up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel good underdog story of a lonely <UNK> who is trying to confront some psycho sexual issues with his dead mother it wants to be gritty realistic and mysterious at the same time it wants to be funny and <UNK> of its disturbed lead as he <UNK> himself as an adult br br to meet this end the film tries hard to be youthful its poster has hand drawn letters looking like that of <UNK> its original soundtrack is comprised of fast paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that <UNK> is ok just a little misguided but strangely the film is anything but youthful br br like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case <UNK> mother young adam keeps its mystery quiet <UNK> and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come <UNK> <UNK> does the opposite it <UNK> its character's <UNK> so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected <UNK> the opening scene is <UNK> in his <UNK> watching his sister <UNK> around with her boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his presence in the household here we see everything that <UNK> will do for the rest of the movie br br the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend the audience can never really trust <UNK> because besides being creepy we think his obsession has led him close to insanity this <UNK> the mystery element for me because <UNK> is too <UNK> to be <UNK> right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home at first it appearing to be looking for the police then he gets extremely <UNK> by a girl who resembles his mother which <UNK> leads the story away from the mystery element br br while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character he was limited by the <UNK> of his psychological needs this movie is in no way mysterious yet it is not blunt either it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues but it adds a very self conscious <UNK> which <UNK> itself as quite the opposite it goes for a soundtrack heavy <UNK> attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who <UNK> buildings picks locks and camps out for the sake of <UNK> these urban <UNK> tom adventures <UNK> <UNK> in are way too difficult for an <UNK> drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy <UNK> or pleasant they are more neutral than anything not <UNK> the character or story <UNK> makes you understand <UNK> yet he fails to build common ground br br he expects you to enjoy <UNK> trials and <UNK> without much <UNK> justification the film <UNK> on its audience's perspective on <UNK> the kind of person who <UNK> in it obviously most people would be disgusted by it and <UNK> <UNK> realizes that but it does not let us see <UNK> <UNK> the morality of his decisions he goes from person to person trying to fill his deep void there is a particularly disturbing line from <UNK> love interest kate where she <UNK> says i love creepy boys perhaps asking the audience to do the same the line tries to <UNK> her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him it's not hard to like <UNK> but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all all the while the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its <UNK> mood br br great performances are <UNK> down by a film with a weak third act <UNK> development and needlessly ambiguous direction from <UNK> recently this film was re named for a us release and for what reason not only is it more unappealing but the hard truth is that the <UNK> character never earns the title <UNK> '
<START> awful awful awful no i didn't like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the <UNK> and dealing of the <UNK> and <UNK> who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didn't need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose i'm at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday br br i'm not a movie maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of <UNK> <UNK> in the main where the actors had been <UNK> with a loose plot line and they were to <UNK> the dialogue henry <UNK> makes the claim that he along with victoria <UNK> actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors <UNK> of the general direction of the film <UNK> the dialogue and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn't flow along the line of the conversation and i'm not going back to look for it and greta <UNK> broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because <UNK> remark was such a non <UNK> you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to <UNK> <UNK> the other actor and break his her concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the documents 3 times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama <UNK> on <UNK> and that was awful too br br the fact that <UNK> was able to attract greta <UNK> no stranger to australia ron silver <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> suggests it was a <UNK> news <UNK> for them peter bogdanovich had a <UNK> the hell am i doing <UNK> look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look i'm a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state faye <UNK> seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the hand held camera became irritating even if it was for <UNK> as i suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became <UNK> to the interest in the various <UNK> walking along the <UNK> trying to <UNK> themselves into shot that at least approached cinema <UNK> so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing 90 odd minutes br br i think we should avoid <UNK> films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to <UNK> a perceived <UNK> level to it is misguided there was really nothing avant garde about it it didn't come across as a work of art and yet it wasn't a documentary either i know it was a <UNK> but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it <UNK> <UNK> correctly so i gave it 3 10
<START> if you read my review of <UNK> <UNK> you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide they're stupid they're silly but they're still pretty fun in a so bad it's good kind of way so still <UNK> with guilt for liking and <UNK> the undeniably hokey <UNK> i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a <UNK> original movie about a half man half hammerhead monster <UNK> people on an island with the <UNK> <UNK> sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter <UNK> how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the mark not by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the <UNK> hammerhead human hybrid takes a <UNK> to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be <UNK> upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler <UNK> our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people br br please read the full review on my <UNK> www <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> the plot had some wretched unbelievable twists however the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent the insight that she comes to there are just moments provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up and embrace life br br that was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable
<START> this movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes dreams love and friendship and <UNK> humour beautifully along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming the sound track enhances and <UNK> the atmosphere and mood of this work of art all actors and actresses give an extremely good performance <UNK> expectation in every way <UNK> <UNK> is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film and she is exceptional capturing the <UNK> and <UNK> that this movie is all about <UNK> <UNK> also works well with her co stars and this is her best work so far br br all in all this is brilliant film and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once
<START> lois <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> via the cinema wrote directed and produced other films on controversial subjects but this may be the first to get wide viewing thanks to tcm this film is her <UNK> of abortion but she cleverly <UNK> the issue by bringing in <UNK> and birth control leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less <UNK> if you have wondered what <UNK> power jr 's famous father looked like here is your chance <UNK> fashions and <UNK> are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece it's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda
<START> daniel day lewis is the most versatile actor alive english <UNK> <UNK> in a room with a view passionate irish thief in in the name of the father an <UNK> violent butcher in gangs of new york in a performance ten times stronger than adrian <UNK> in the <UNK> and as the outrageous <UNK> brown with cerebral <UNK> in my left foot just to name a few his roles all influence <UNK> but each is <UNK> and utterly unique he changes completely with each character he takes on and i'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything anything br br as <UNK> brown he is stunning he does not <UNK> the character and he does not pity the character a difficult achievement and <UNK> brown comes to life a smart man an outrageous man human br br this movie despite small scene transition faults and the like is an inspiration yes it's predictable but is it <UNK> sentimental no i laughed i cried not a single moment of cheese proof that this isn't a hollywood movie br br my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when <UNK> is discussing <UNK> with <UNK> peter and her friends here's where daniel day lewis reaches an acting climax i'll kick you in the only part of your <UNK> that's animated wheel out the <UNK> and his performance never slows down never <UNK> and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch it again again and i never get tired of <UNK> <UNK> eyes <UNK> and <UNK> speeches br br a must see <UNK> sho <UNK>
<START> i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good <UNK> of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie it was very original whoever thought up this movie gets a standing <UNK> from me the acting was great luke perry did an excellent job once again i give this movie the highest rating
<START> this film is really cool every thing looks like it came out of the comic book the sets the costumes and the plot is great clark <UNK> is again our favorite batman he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off superman is great too the flying effects are ok but its a fan film so we cant expect them to be the greatest the shot with superman catching the car was very believable it was cool this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real its got every thing you would want in a batman superman movie one exception though i would cast the joker instead of 2 face overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film
<START> i am a big fan of <UNK> work and of the <UNK> one books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the <UNK> <UNK> being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start br br from the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as <UNK> first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less <UNK> several characters are poorly cast too for starters <UNK> is <UNK> as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smith br br re <UNK> re assignment and even <UNK> of certain characters further <UNK> this film for example the <UNK> of victor <UNK> and the entire back story of the virus including the involvement of <UNK> makes the entire point to the film somewhat <UNK> marty <UNK> is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes <UNK> much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake br br rachel <UNK> is presumably supposed to be <UNK> <UNK> from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie <UNK> should be called sophia <UNK> but she is also supposed to work from the cia not <UNK> one which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important <UNK> one doesn't even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is <UNK> one <UNK> by the president as a <UNK> measure against further <UNK> terrorism br br to be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation i'm afraid you'll be <UNK> disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lack <UNK> editing and poor effects the <UNK> story line and dull as <UNK> water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
<START> well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen they have tried out these <UNK> child of satan the anti christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them they think that it's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood this movie doesn't have any idea in it actors and filming is just terrible cant even make out that 10 line <UNK> of this movie really nothing to tell about but that it's just horrible how they can make movies like that in their right mind just can't understand that this cant be a hollywood movie is it just don't go watch this use your money more wisely
<START> the movie is more about <UNK> than grey owl it's also about <UNK> canada the english grey <UNK> aunts and the north bay <UNK> excellent story br br this is an excellent movie more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values the key scene is grey owl <UNK> his <UNK> to <UNK> and her reaction br br a few observations on the user ratings note that the user ratings are <UNK> polar <UNK> at 5 and 7 it's not for everyone but has a strong following this movie is underrated and overlooked but will be noticed for years to come also few women have watched the movie but they rate it more highly than men has it been <UNK> properly br br
<START> i can't really <UNK> the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think it's only just in the category br br there's nothing sinister in this piece and that's where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side <UNK> may be <UNK> human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the <UNK> of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hints br br there's no attempt made to question <UNK> motivations as one with do with <UNK> or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to <UNK> which would make him even more <UNK> if the human <UNK> was actually played out br br that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end br br the story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago and then putting away
<START> i've been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a 6 year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the <UNK> which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a <UNK> out of a plastic cave man <UNK> which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious <UNK> and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation it's a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood every <UNK> i've seen since has been an enormous let down the characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but why is it not better known and why isn't it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again
<START> although released among a flock of revenge minded action flicks kill bill <UNK> 2 the <UNK> walking tall man on fire works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always watchable denzel washington one of the best actors around today br br in man on fire based on a j <UNK> 1980 novel first filmed in 1987 with scott glenn washington plays a down on his luck ex <UNK> who has now <UNK> to drinking from a flash of jack daniels until his old partner christopher walken offers him a chance at redemption he is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year old daughter <UNK> fanning of a mexican businessman marc <UNK> and his american born wife <UNK> mitchell while he and fanning work like oil and water first not mixing very well he really gets to form a bond with her <UNK> her to do better at swimming while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past it is that very bond that will force washington back into his old line of work when fanning is kidnapped and held for a 10 million <UNK> and he is nearly killed with almost any other stock action hero <UNK> segal etc the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before but <UNK> character though he's killing for a reason does not particularly enjoy doing what he does still he gets help from a very <UNK> mexican newspaper reporter rachel <UNK> out to expose la <UNK> the <UNK> the kidnap gang responsible for <UNK> <UNK> br br man on fire is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work nearly headache inducing montage editing and various film <UNK> that are par for the course of its director tony scott top gun <UNK> tide but which are not necessarily unique to him witness oliver <UNK> use of montage in <UNK> or sam <UNK> in his classic 60s and 70s films still scott gets a very good performance from washington as well as fanning who comes across as far more than a typical movie brat kid harry <UNK> <UNK> south of the border spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and even linda <UNK> classic 1977 country rock version of blue <UNK> although the film overall is quite violent it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years and overall it is much better than most
<START> a surprisingly effective thriller this br br david duchovny and michelle <UNK> <UNK> forbes are a successful professional couple he a writer she a photographer forbes is desperate to move to california and in an act of compromise <UNK> agrees to the move on the condition that along the way they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers his idea he writes the words she takes the pictures with the end result a <UNK> coffee table book that will set them up for life to help <UNK> the trip they decide to car share and <UNK> the fact as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the <UNK> and shortly after killing his <UNK> he and his girlfriend juliette lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek inevitably <UNK> ensues br br pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early <UNK> and is <UNK> backed up by lewis playing her <UNK> white trash character that seems to be her <UNK> setting duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and as events spiral out of control you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension <UNK> br br intelligent sinister and beautifully shot this deserves recognition beyond its current status a top movie
<START> made in the same year as vertigo this is an equally <UNK> movie though in a much lighter vein it's set in an enchanted new york during the winter kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart but gets caught in it instead the interesting <UNK> is that <UNK> rival is played by <UNK> rule who <UNK> the part of <UNK> in <UNK> on broadway the part that novak would make famous on film
<START> well finally got to see the remake last night in london unintentionally hilarious <UNK> and devoid of any real humour i don't really know where to start whilst i was entertained by this strange homage it didn't really move me the acting is <UNK> hammy there is no original music the costumes are far too <UNK> there is a ridiculous <UNK> months <UNK> insert after the burning of <UNK> cage which didn't come soon enough for my liking the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience <UNK> <UNK> as did the comedy <UNK> out of various <UNK> on the island it's such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the <UNK> strike very strange
<START> cross eyed is a very original and funny movie i think adam jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really <UNK> it in a good way this film is smart <UNK> and consistently entertaining and funny as a writer director jones <UNK> complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable the story is definitely something you haven't seen before which is good it's unique and fun and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a <UNK> comedy br br a very promising first film
<START> i've never been huge on <UNK> films they're cool but once you get over that initial rush of <UNK> it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary br br the exceptions have been the powerful <UNK> the <UNK> wild california and now the <UNK> the human body a super sized look at the <UNK> of our bodies br br our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply <UNK> this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in <UNK> just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted br br here you can see the inside of a <UNK> heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your <UNK> the tiny <UNK> in your <UNK> that process sound the development of a baby inside a mother's <UNK> and surprisingly a few of the um less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> in the stomach br br this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other <UNK> documentaries for instance we've all seen <UNK> finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin <UNK> let's get it on it's creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time i remember the day i first saw this on <UNK> sun was shining looked like a good day then i saw this product of rick sloane which consisted of horrible <UNK> dolls <UNK> havoc in the crappy 80s fest land kevin <UNK> <UNK> tries to impress his girlfriend manages an assistant security guard job fights with <UNK> and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images no plot or story is needed obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves an army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff and the <UNK> friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say he has got some nice red shorts plus i really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket <UNK> just when you think it's over wait until the club <UNK> scene ask for road <UNK> br br i advise that after viewing this film a good month to regain senses and sanity and if you see rick sloane give him a good kick to the <UNK> to show how much we appreciate this <UNK> called hobgoblins

<START> as b movies go it was well above average i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although i am trying to <UNK> any such tendency as sequels usually go it was utterly fantastic despite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie <UNK> despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original <UNK> br br the movie was similar in ways to the superman series in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents who seemed <UNK> along the same lines as the <UNK> in the superman stories and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of <UNK> or otherwise non <UNK> children <UNK> and or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as real genius and to a more superficial degree doctor <UNK> and struck a particularly strong <UNK> br br the film had a positive message and was fun to watch i found some of the insights and accuracy in terms of depiction of certain aspects of <UNK> experiences fascinating and even profoundly touching at times these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula driven schlock and gratuitous sex <UNK> in this case as the sexual elements were <UNK> done and violence that makes b movies or <UNK> plays for that matter so much fun to watch br br this is a must watch for all comic book sci fi remote viewing <UNK> and horror fans with the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original <UNK>
<START> as horror fans we all know that blind <UNK> are a crap shoot sometimes we find a real gem but many times we find that the film we've just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> made worse by the completely <UNK> rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box such is the case with five across the eyes a title i'm sure is a double <UNK> referring to both the films budget and the <UNK> anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out br br the story or at least what the <UNK> writers think passes for one centers on a group of teen girls who <UNK> decide to go on a backwoods <UNK> late at night after leaving a football game and run <UNK> of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a <UNK> <UNK> in a gas station parking lot br br in fairness it's an interesting idea some of the best horrors have very simple story lines it's in the execution of five across the eyes that this idea falls flat the film tries to be a cross between the blair witch project with its shaky camera work and the texas chainsaw massacre in its bare bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither what we get instead are redundant scenes of chase torture release chase torture release in that order for <UNK> minutes with long <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in between chase sequences br br the look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark which in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism here it's merely annoying the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard pressed to find anything to sympathize with them one character stops to get a first aid <UNK> and tend to some <UNK> on her face while <UNK> heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed another girl <UNK> hilariously dumb lines like don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she <UNK> you you're dead br br it was an <UNK> from <UNK> magazine and <UNK> com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out talk about a fake <UNK> perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section i'm all for low budget indie horror but this one takes the crap cake give five across the eyes or fate get it a pass br br <UNK> gives fate 1 slash out of five
<START> with one of my very favorite actors james <UNK> i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasn't after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows what's going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you've seen 5 sci fi movies or you are over 9 years old do yourself a favor and skip this one
<START> who's got the gold is unfortunately the last of the hanzo the razor films starring <UNK> <UNK> as the title character the multi weapon <UNK> authority <UNK> samurai officer with the unique technique of <UNK> <UNK> out of unwilling female <UNK> until they <UNK> the <UNK> and beg for more br br this entry starts with hanzo <UNK> a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that's filled with <UNK> <UNK> filled with gold stolen from the <UNK> this leads to hanzo discovering a <UNK> <UNK> scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk the requisite <UNK> and rape <UNK> ensue <UNK> in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films br br not quite as strong and enjoyable as the <UNK> part 2 of the series but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese <UNK> style films 8 10
<START> this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion from the careful <UNK> of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator you'll be <UNK> it's an absolute must see for anyone interested in <UNK> <UNK> relations and how the <UNK> work together are also great not overly done either i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history too how the police work with the political party being what it was it is truly fascinating and frustrating the settings are beautiful it's been a while since i saw this movie the first time it doesn't <UNK> it's impact not overly dramatic or graphic it leaves enough to the imagination well you'll see
<START> i really like 101 <UNK> when it came out in 1996 now 5 years later i went to see <UNK> <UNK> in 2001 i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it's more funnier more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version one hundred and one <UNK> <UNK> i wonder if there are plans for <UNK> <UNK> i hope there is maybe yes maybe no all of us <UNK> fans will have to find out if there is going to be <UNK> <UNK> in the future
<START> this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all <UNK> and when <UNK> keaton is at her best well it just doesn't get any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star br br my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person and neither was her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around br br one of the other <UNK> said the movie had a political agenda that is a <UNK> thing to say there was no politics at all in this movie
<START> this may be the worst show i've ever seen aside from the <UNK> of having a sitcom about hitler it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its <UNK> humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy it's just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look it's hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about <UNK> slave the secret diary of <UNK> pfeiffer chances are you'll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd
<START> this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball especially <UNK> and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the <UNK> kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a can opener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made <UNK> fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any <UNK> <UNK> nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a <UNK> and finally whoever created the nightmare known as <UNK> needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the <UNK> tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level
<START> night of the <UNK> is a very good film that has a good cast which includes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john schneider <UNK> <UNK> laura <UNK> david ferry helen hughes <UNK> <UNK> alex <UNK> thomas <UNK> <UNK> kitchen and graham <UNK> the acting by all of these actors is very good the special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john schneider <UNK> <UNK> laura <UNK> david ferry helen hughes <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the cast in the film action mystery thrillers dramas and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today
<START> this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series br br compared to the live action series this show is utter crap the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to <UNK> but i think maybe kids <UNK> this crap br br the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless <UNK> and she uses magic to fix it thats <UNK> the idea every episode the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina so then gem becomes a witch and <UNK> <UNK> to become her slave this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like <UNK> a god which is quite right since he's her mind control slave but this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort
<START> some genre films need to be dressed up this one was an exception taken on its own merit it's a dressed down version of the horror genre film with minimal special effects it manages to be a psychological study of sorts with a simple yet existential theme who gets hit by the bus and why her it's not a great film yet because there is little contrived about it the story works subtle and all about the interactions of the characters actually there is one <UNK> in the opening scenes but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people <UNK> to a physical and psychological challenge you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy value the need for a bit of adventure in your life and wonder what would i do in this situation
<START> i did not intend to write this review but having read the <UNK> review that shows up on this movie's <UNK> i felt compelled to write a <UNK> the movie in a word is <UNK> it does not deserve the <UNK> review that the writer has written i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent in fact i too was turned off by the excessive show of <UNK> <UNK> that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent however i must beg to <UNK> with the reviewer in that this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for <UNK> action i think what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal <UNK> of one kind or another this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is <UNK> and expressed by ordinary mostly well meaning basically good people and they usually have no <UNK> on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life ultimately it is a matter of faith you have to take it on faith and that's all and if you are given to faith then you can appreciate any show of faith and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome it is thus at the same time <UNK> to note the reviewer reaction to the movie in any case the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are <UNK> <UNK> in this world that <UNK> all wounded souls regardless of their religious <UNK> and that's just the core message of the film please note the last scene of the movie if you don't get this in the end the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally i do agree with the reviewer in that the <UNK> stuff was a bit too much however given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie i think the director was trying to balance the act <UNK> he might not be called an <UNK>  <UNK> the actor <UNK> ho song was great as always he's so balanced and just perfect that he's just amazing he's my favorite korean actor no doubt i know the actress do <UNK> <UNK> got the cannes award for best actress for this movie however i did not find any <UNK> in her acting it seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and <UNK> all in all a great movie if you don't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it if it leaves you <UNK> or uncomfortable or asking questions then think if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place
<START> anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz 1920s dress the <UNK> and ultra <UNK> <UNK> e g me on all counts will want to like this movie but the sad fact is that that's all there is the plot is banal and obvious the acting mostly either awful or playing to the <UNK> side of the goings on and when the whole <UNK> over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke this is a beautifully made bad movie
<START> this is one of the most hateful and cruel movies i've seen in a long time sadly i was <UNK> into sticking with it since donald <UNK> presence <UNK> gave it some credibility that's the last time that'll happen br br <UNK> ann <UNK> character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come there were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask where is the justice br br why is late night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with <UNK> mayhem most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on them being <UNK> and murdered this film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process all it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its sickness and insulting the viewer's intelligence br br the cast is <UNK> good my guess is that they <UNK> sutherland first and used him to lure the others like <UNK> into this br br i'm kicking myself for wasting time giving this piece of garbage a chance
<START> my god what's going on a uwe boll film and positive comments wow br br nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from <UNK> to <UNK> work i myself as i have stated in previous uwe boll reviews only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good i mean it must happen one day br br alas seed is not that day i don't quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that seed is the thing to remember people is that all the <UNK> in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net or so mr boll believes i still can't for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film i understand the concept that seed the killer is a <UNK> and enjoys watching such stuff but can't understand why mr boll thought putting real footage in the film would work maybe to shock us hmmm well i for one am not <UNK> and can handle seeing anything on film i don't though find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest if you were trying to shock me it didn't work it just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because uwe boll is allowed to continue making films this sort of context may have worked for films in the 70 80's cannibal holocaust but not todays market br br with that out of the way we can move on to the fact that uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like <UNK> 2 you can just tell that there wasn't a huge amount of money floating around for production br br as per usual mr boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of <UNK> victims in the first 25 mins each of these videos ends in a <UNK> up <UNK> of the victim it's all very boring and tedious i won't comment on the <UNK> scene as it's laughable and just another cheap <UNK> factor br br if you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch seed the lighting here is horrible and uwe has the old <UNK> not using a steady <UNK> fiasco that he did with <UNK> 2 watch as the police officers die in ever <UNK> increasing ways until such point as seed is caught this scene is <UNK> bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it the cop actually tells seed he could have shot him for some un be known reason the cop doesn't shoot him given that seed is a <UNK> that kills kids as well as adults you'd have thought at this point in the script that sense would <UNK> br br from here we are treated to a stupid execution scene followed by the cops <UNK> seed alive and they know he is alive why not shoot him in the head followed by seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the <UNK> family br br what i'm trying to get across to you all here is that it's just plain stupid it's not even hollywood horror stupid just plain dumb uwe boll can not direct anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person br br once again we are treated to a poorly acted directed <UNK> produced scripted piece of <UNK> crap
<START> wow this film had a huge impact on me it moved me it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly the setting of the film is realistic the film was an eye opener i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that <UNK> br br the content of the film was very very moving it was one of the best films that i have seen this year the br br girl who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character ron <UNK> gives a fantastic performance the film moved me to tears it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide everyone should go see this film i think this film will make a difference i loved it
<START> i probably saw this movie first in about 1995 since then i've returned to it many times it's great i especially like the first and second clips creation and civilization rising wow this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation cg is way older than i am as i know the film <UNK> was made 7 years before my time but this film was a landmark in the early <UNK> it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music i like it so much i think i'll go watch it now bye
<START> god bless 80's slasher films this is a fun fun movie this is what slasher films are all about now i'm not saying horror movies just slasher films it goes like this a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid <UNK> and <UNK> and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong <UNK> and back for revenge sporting a joker <UNK> mask pretty creepy looking might i add marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion that is basically the plot what's wrong with that that's the beauty of 80's slasher films most of them i would say a lot of things could be so ridiculous but they keep drawing you more in <UNK> in as they go by especially this film br br it features some outrageous killings and some are quite creative as well <UNK> of a beer can acid bath i can't remember a <UNK> ever being used before in any other slasher film either it really is a fun fun movie that's all it is <UNK> the fact that the characters are complete idiots never mind their stupidity and never mind the outrageous random things that occur in this film such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer when he's not even switching any buttons you'll see and <UNK> being able to <UNK> up blood <UNK> being able to have acid come out of them just use that as part of your entertainment because thats what really makes it entertaining br br movies like this represent 80's slashers never again could movies like this get made know why it isn't the 80's anymore that is why you should just <UNK> them for what they are good fun i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of <UNK> such as friday the 13th br br one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well marty <UNK> a <UNK> nerd who kills all his old <UNK> in a creepy <UNK> mask a good villain makes a good slasher simon <UNK> who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released that alone adds something creepy to the film and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character i guess all in all great 80's slashers fun it's a shame it will never be the same again
<START> this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well br br it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas <UNK> and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the <UNK> of <UNK> i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile br br alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his <UNK> of max makes for a funny and touching relationship br br not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think you'll like this one
<START> i loved this film i thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd <UNK> not easily forgotten br br the script is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect each character has their moment and i laughed hard throughout this film comedic timing was spot on br br
<START> spoilers spoilers <UNK> is a british made thriller released in the us by first national karloff is dr <UNK> who has to leave his research because his <UNK> have <UNK> up karloff is forced to <UNK> to france and start up a medical practice he is <UNK> by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband she knows karloff needs the money br br karloff agrees to the <UNK> and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband all the while the wife is <UNK> about town with the local no good playboy karloff finally <UNK> the old <UNK> with poison and he kicks off however his son from another marriage arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed when he <UNK> the <UNK> to the wife she goes <UNK> and even bites the son's hand br br meanwhile <UNK> nurse has misplaced the <UNK> karloff used to kill the old man when karloff finds out he isn't getting any money he asks the wife to poison the son the nurse suspects karloff and finds the missing <UNK> analysis shows poison but not quite in time as karloff kidnaps the nurse br br to make a long story short the nurse escapes gets the police and manages to save the son who is about to be <UNK> by karloff karloff instead <UNK> himself and dies br br this movie does have some good points karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in the devil <UNK> and the man who lived again it is peculiar however to see him walk around <UNK> and slightly <UNK> over we never find out why he is walking this way i suspect the director thought it made him more sinister br br the actress playing the 2 timing wife overacts something terrible she has a french accent even though she overacts badly you still manage to hate her or maybe you hate her because of her acting br br a little below average for a karloff vehicle if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy the audio is a bit choppy
<START> i liked this show a lot we got the first and only it would appear series in the uk on channel 4 the characterisation was right on the money a bit like the simpsons in that all the different <UNK> of small town <UNK> were represented br br there was no laughter track i hadn't seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here <UNK> the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that and not just <UNK> it up for the cameras br br all in all a quirky little number that <UNK> me just right i can't help but think that maybe it missed it's mark with certain audiences i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable hour br br i'll round this off with my standard comment where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again any ideas
<START> picture the <UNK> annoying <UNK> kids from college in a <UNK> film throw in a <UNK> of story and a whole lot of awful acting and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is br br shot badly bad effects worse acting contrived attempt at shocking horror everyone i've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it the sex scenes are disturbing not necessarily for their content but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible the last sex scene is just foul even before she gets to the guy br br i'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate which is why i picked this one up but for your own sake save yourself the time and avoid this <UNK> it's that bad i literally threw it in the garbage
<START> the <UNK> is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb yes that's how shallow i am i don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so i guess i'll just have to see it  now the <UNK> can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister <UNK> <UNK> but this movie is actually more of a <UNK> between comedy and thriller first of all there's something very wrong with the <UNK> on the old vhs box i watched it says he had good <UNK> a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the <UNK> that's not the case actually protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an <UNK> <UNK> it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith still with hair in this film both of them are approached to become members of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but during their <UNK> <UNK>  in which they have to <UNK> a mountain dressed in their <UNK> white <UNK>  barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg when lewis returns with the other frat boys barney <UNK> to death already together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend <UNK> trip with <UNK> body hidden in the <UNK> <UNK> lewis has to cover for him so that <UNK> absence doesn't look suspicious the set up of the <UNK> is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither the soundtrack is cheerful and full of light headed tunes but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the <UNK> with romantic <UNK> of lewis and his outer town girlfriend <UNK> through the countryside i didn't like the final twist because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after the <UNK> is not a complete waste of time but still i'm glad i found an ex rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd
<START> 90 minutes of <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> to boyfriend bill <UNK> <UNK> at the high school dance <UNK> <UNK> to big <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> bread <UNK> nearly gets gang raped ah the pleasures of crown international drive in features you must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on dvd players they were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their <UNK> and <UNK> the lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience they probably only tuned in when the t a on screen matched what they were up to out in the parking lot the film is really irritating when watched as a story it's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it my favorite <UNK> 1 bill and his friend <UNK> the teacher to find <UNK> with no <UNK> or change of underwear they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher just like in real life 2 after being <UNK> and nearly raped by <UNK> <UNK> and after their innocent friend pan is <UNK> beaten <UNK> and her girlfriend find an <UNK> motorcycle on the road <UNK> immediately <UNK> up and <UNK> i'm <UNK> to big <UNK> but again it's a lot more fun to talk read about than sit through
<START> this movie was just <UNK> by mst3k and with good reason first and foremost because it is a cop movie starring joe don baker who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western singer br br all the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads bar fights children <UNK> in shoot outs bad acting lame police <UNK> bad acting revenge justice endless <UNK> and of course bad acting don't watch this without an mst3k <UNK> folks
<START> love rosario dawson think she's one of the finest actresses of the modern era br br descent seems to be more about self <UNK> than anything else it's the consistent <UNK> in everything in the film the dialog is flat the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided the only <UNK> is the representation of self <UNK> in the characters and <UNK> journey from self <UNK> to loss of <UNK> and back again br br <UNK> this as a rape classic isn't appropriate and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the film the standard <UNK> audience wouldn't particularly like this film and maybe that's the point the film asks more questions than it answers and it does confront it's target audience whether they like it or not there's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn't slap the audience across the face with self righteous <UNK> it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be all the wrong reasons br br descent is a good film which imho is severely under rated
<START> couldn't go to sleep the other night so i got up <UNK> on the tube this movie was on br br film makers bit off more than they could chew just as ambitious in scope as forrest <UNK> was but <UNK> read like an fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man <UNK> us through the era <UNK> just relies on tired clichés to tell the story almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's <UNK> br br take how we're introduced to <UNK> <UNK> his black maid receiving a framed picture of <UNK> <UNK> talk about heavy handed why not just give him a t shirt saying i heart black people br br sunshine isn't free love <UNK> man oh no i didn't have my period br br mary beth i want to go to berkeley not square <UNK> uh excuse me there was nothing square about la in the 60s rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique we just hear this brat <UNK> about not going there br br can't even remember the black kid's name he was just a prop used to show how <UNK> <UNK> the other kids are br br thing is period pieces don't have to be this cheesy take <UNK> confused look how we're introduced to the football hero randall <UNK> we don't first see him on the football field in fact we never see him play football we're introduced to him in class <UNK> his <UNK> poker buddies to a party br br in <UNK> <UNK> isn't a casual by product of some chick getting knocked up it's much more <UNK> more serious than that it's <UNK> in the <UNK> room over a flip discussion about <UNK> island serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings but real life is like that br br some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant i agree which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby <UNK> <UNK>
<START> slashers 2 outta 5 stars br br not really a very good movie but i did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with the movie is ostensibly an episode of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three <UNK> creeps sent after to them to kill them the survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead the main <UNK> to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad none of the real people seem real at all the actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show the movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep <UNK> on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another i would imagine
<START> after seeing only half of the film in school back in november today i saw that it was on <UNK> channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it br br the book that the film is based on <UNK> is ok this is a terrible adaption of it though br br awful and i mean awful acting bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of <UNK> br br the film starts off brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen sporting a <UNK> <UNK> his head to cheap 80s rock music and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad his parents are divorced now cue the dramatic pause now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father the pilot is a fat ugly rude man wasn't like that in the book who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack br br the plane within another two minutes has gone empty on fuel leaving us the viewers to assume that he's been up there for hours even though the sun hasn't changed position and the scenery looks exactly the same <UNK> he's crashed landed br br this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book in the book it said his jacket was torn to <UNK> but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips looks like he just bought it it never said he <UNK> a mountain saw a wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear it said a <UNK> but not a bear it never said he eats the several bugs that he does it never mentions the second <UNK> or that he learned to get those <UNK> skin them and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes that is destroyed by one of the <UNK> nor does it mention him hurting his <UNK> from one of the <UNK> br br i don't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a <UNK> all it was was just a <UNK> that knocked down several of his things br br my favorite part of this camp fest was <UNK> lame flashbacks that are never mentioned in the book especially the cliché scene of brian waking up walking over to the window and seeing his dad with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck leaving and screams <UNK> yet of course his father didn't hear him even though he was just right outside and he punches his fist through the window wtf br br the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book i said close in the book i think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to brian when he landed was you're the kid who they've been looking for they stopped months ago yet they left that line out in the movie br br there's a pathetic <UNK> with brian somehow without <UNK> or therapy getting back to normal with his family i think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for <UNK> because they had a turkey on the counter then it shows his temporary home for what in the movie seemed like three days but in the book was for several months and his <UNK> still in a tree where he left it also didn't happen in the book showing where he <UNK> a message so perfectly done home where we really supposed to believe that he <UNK> that that perfectly with just that <UNK> br br no quote can sum this movie up better then when <UNK> from ghost world said this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again perfect description of this movie br br i wouldn't recommend it to somebody who hasn't read the book and are just looking to watch a movie nor would i to somebody who has read the book because they'll be disappointed and bored to death br br for those who have read the book leave what your imagination created as the movie this is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book br br 1 10
<START> since this is part 2 then <UNK> it to part one br br man that was on many places <UNK> too many time jumps etc br br i have to say that i was really <UNK> br br only <UNK> little lame action and thats it br br they could have done that better br br
<START> knowing how old a film is ought to prepare the viewer for a few things and with those things in mind perhaps the <UNK> be more tolerable so it was when i watched revolt of the zombies the heavy <UNK> on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected as should the <UNK> or absence of special effects in those days a great deal is asked from the imagination of the <UNK> maybe too much in this case and the plot isn't easy to follow some <UNK> <UNK> asian soldiers in wwi performed very admirably although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to <UNK> investigate the key to long distance <UNK> is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes <UNK> <UNK> with the beau of the gal for whom he has the <UNK> to prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he shouldn't have done 'cause once they're all <UNK> many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again below average even with <UNK> <UNK> recommended for only the extremely patient
<START> having seen the hot <UNK> <UNK> in the pretty good wrong turn i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead of all movies haven't seen that one yet but considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever safe to say i made the wrong choice there is simply nothing to recommend this movie and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut it didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend it simply made no sense held no excitement had very little interesting acting or compelling writing the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running and the reason is obvious the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together <UNK> to meaningless effect get wrong turn instead if you want to see <UNK> i would like to see a movie with her and the super hot <UNK> <UNK> but i don't think even that would have made this movie watchable <UNK> affleck so promising in good will hunting is awful here he seems to lack both intelligence and guts that's enough on this one
<START> national <UNK> class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn't stay long in theaters in my big city why because it's bad br br not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly <UNK> then and have remained <UNK> after this turkey br br the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect br br just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a <UNK> watching this embarrassing misfire
<START> about the baby why wasn't big brother assuming he'd be hungry for a bottle or some <UNK> or a <UNK> change he should have been screaming non stop after that many hours without care definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he didn't need to br br and why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere didn't any <UNK> trees fall on the roads and block them br br i can't imagine the cops at the <UNK> not immediately following after any young person who would crash it especially when they said it was dangerous to go there br br that being said it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch for a change
<START> every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn't always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was <UNK> by some glowing reviews and the rohmer <UNK> br br there's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially <UNK> the actors onto painted digital back drops of revolution era france this quickly <UNK> and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what we're left with is a boring and <UNK> film about <UNK> in 18th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so <UNK> the dialogue so <UNK> and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was <UNK> who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie would've greatly <UNK> from some semblance of emotional build up and a music score there's some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most <UNK> french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a <UNK> otherwise avoid this <UNK> at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i <UNK> off twice
<START> my wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up it is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination br br that is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that i <UNK> like them but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it
<START> i like ghost stories good ghost stories of <UNK> in the night voices that cannot be explained now i've see many of them as special <UNK> have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw it was on once in 1972 i was only 9 but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special <UNK> than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george c scott in the <UNK> wish someone would do more ghost stories like these
<START> well this movie is amazingly awful i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i'm sure they did not write their lines which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher while watching this creature unknown i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew but if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of <UNK> this straight to dvd clichéd wanna be action thriller horror movie <UNK> to light
<START> nicolas <UNK> projects are <UNK> to say the least but are never less than interesting <UNK> is obviously first and foremost an adapted <UNK> it's <UNK> and pretty much <UNK> <UNK> but it pays to view this film more than once the underlying themes are not overtly presented and what's more it takes a while to <UNK> to the <UNK> and role <UNK> of the four protagonists einstein mccarthy <UNK> and <UNK> br br einstein is <UNK> by guilt over <UNK> yet <UNK> the simplicity of a sexual <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> is sick of being seen as a bimbo and <UNK> intellectual <UNK> senator mccarthy is at the height of his witch hunting powers but is an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is insecure about his celebrity self obsessed and prone to violence each of them contains the <UNK> of their own destruction each character has a troubled abused abusive past and a questionable future gradually we see that obsession itself is the central theme america's obsession with its <UNK> cultural icons and <UNK> the <UNK> of the protagonists for something none can have peace of mind and or happiness br br compared with the theory of <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> field theory and indeed the <UNK> itself all the aspirations and interactions of <UNK> protagonists seem insignificant yet these aspects of the physical universe it's all quantum trust me affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us <UNK> mention of the principle behind the <UNK> bomb without <UNK> it as such is not an <UNK> per se but can only be understood by a contemporary audience indeed all the references within the script are only accessible to a <UNK> viewer one <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> personality <UNK> and how they affect us in the 21st century br br this film and its screenplay are either very very clever or extremely <UNK> and pretentious ultimately however probably insignificant br br live long and <UNK> br br
<START> i really can't believe this movie is not in the imdb worst 250 it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was don't be like them just pass this by i'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie
<START> when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was <UNK> the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampire zombie creatures br br lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the <UNK> t shirts looked kind of cool i don't want to <UNK> film students or splatter movies generally but i've seen <UNK> and i've seen a 20 dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap
<START> this was a painful example of a cheap boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to <UNK> local content <UNK> the writing was truly terrible and i'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the <UNK> <UNK> norman br br nothing about this tv series was funny ever not even mildly amusing it was just tired and bad and worst of all it really thought it was funny it was simply embarrassing to watch br br there is something very <UNK> about this show being given 10 out of 10 on imdb try to find a real review by a real australian viewer of the show there weren't many and it is impossible or crazy there are <UNK> of bread that are funnier than this show br br avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional
<START> some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but i got chance only recently i had high hopes of seeing something interesting from kamal hans what i saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed i could not understand what was the message except <UNK> <UNK> i am more like many religion type but i felt kamal <UNK> is a man low character to have <UNK> this kind of thought he could have made a horror movie than this crap he tried to add hollywood genre of <UNK> and god <UNK> he did not <UNK> that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world <UNK> this is a much <UNK> movie for a film school vs regular public shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has starting of story tried chaos to borrow ideas from <UNK> effect then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting <UNK> once again i insult <UNK> more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one
<START> just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay <UNK> and joe <UNK> are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man so well cast 10 out of 10
<START> after looking at monkeys <UNK> apes for more than one hour i was feeling like one too i was an ape spending money on this movie please people hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like bridget <UNK> diary
<START> dreary <UNK> just plain dreadful and awful let's be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d <UNK> you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive <UNK> you don't get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane <UNK> <UNK> runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a <UNK> for any <UNK> and a super human abilities <UNK> returns and fights dressed as the double d <UNK> a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack <UNK> drive motivation and are <UNK> thin the acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the <UNK> nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the <UNK> <UNK> to the heavy handed <UNK> references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> de la <UNK> are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the <UNK> of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former <UNK> instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg 13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing <UNK> by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j <UNK> play the <UNK> of a wax museum and <UNK> to his wax frankenstein <UNK> called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun
<START> i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to <UNK> really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to <UNK> and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy <UNK> was not actually needed for this film and i think the director writer got carried away with the <UNK> of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on <UNK> part it may have worked <UNK> acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
<START> this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the <UNK> butler character came across as such a dopey <UNK> i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching br br i don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often <UNK> <UNK> but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house <UNK> to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture br br dean morgan rochester ny
<START> in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies br br this movie does <UNK> the first i won't deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn't even notice nor would it have <UNK> if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began br br this was my favorite movie at age 3 6 and it did not scare me or confuse me at all br br
<START> la <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> is based on the short story <UNK> written by <UNK> <UNK> lucy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an american <UNK> <UNK> to the son of an <UNK> marquis arrives at the family's <UNK> <UNK> and learns of a mythical <UNK> beast <UNK> to <UNK> the nearby forest it is <UNK> that a former lady of the house <UNK> lane once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident the beast is an art house mix of surreal horror explicit sleaze and porno there's implied <UNK> assault and <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> fake <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> breasts masturbation with a rose and most graphic of all the eponymous beast <UNK> with incredibly big <UNK> still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless the women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time overall la <UNK> is a visual feast whether it be from the <UNK> attention to detail or the visual <UNK> pregnant with information <UNK> masterpiece should be watched with care and attention a must see for fans of european cult cinema
<START> now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what <UNK> meaning does it have wow some demented <UNK> shows up and they <UNK> i can get a <UNK> from this <UNK> is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i <UNK> that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the <UNK> episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film it is just an animation it should be on video br br ps i'll give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there's no <UNK>
<START> i've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons br br 1 this is without doubt the worst film i've ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky i paid five pound for it i've seen it in <UNK> for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal br br the plot summary a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero <UNK> turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang sitting on <UNK> baby sitting he kills them one by one until he is <UNK> and found by the police br br why is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage br br i've bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company <UNK> and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isn't even any gore okay no gore what else can a film like this offer <UNK> no not even any <UNK> br br it's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique <UNK> but any potential <UNK> watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten
<START> i want to <UNK> a few things i am not familiar with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movies and i am very familiar with art cinema i grow up in the seventies times of <UNK> fellini bergman <UNK> and many others br br art movies then were really art like paints people did it to express their inner feelings not really worried about if other people understand anything they were beyond commercial values just look some old antonioni or early <UNK> and you will understand br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> duo <UNK> the <UNK> cloud has nothing to do with that it is an <UNK> movie intended to fool festival judges and critics playing many things without saying anything br br the story makes no sense the lack of water makes the government to promote the use of <UNK> to <UNK> a girl in desperation steal water from the public <UNK> <UNK> there is also a porno start neighbor trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with there is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star the mess ends with a sexual scene not pornographic that many people feel shocked about but i believe it is less provocative than you can see in american pie or history of violence br br the two main characters never talk sometimes a musical number 60 style appears and explains through a song what is happening in characters minds these video clips are really welcomed because the previous scene without dialog or music only people looking at each other takes sometimes 4 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is too much br br there is also a few bits about the difficult to make sex without love the selfish mind of the porno industry br br it is obvious this movie intended get away with it to fool festival <UNK> and critics it have a few pseudo shocking scenes within the limits of <UNK> censorship and many subjects are open but nothing is <UNK> or goes anywhere br br these tricks got the movie a few <UNK> important <UNK> in film festivals and get the movie an <UNK> commercial success i see the movie in france and the theater was packed br br however please do not be fooled there is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie it is boring and empty really a fraud to public boogie nights which i did not really liked <UNK> and 9 songs are far better movies
<START> the original les <UNK> was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect <UNK> must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in <UNK> everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny <UNK> is a horrible parody of <UNK> except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved <UNK> just don't see this film just see <UNK> again
<START> i rented this film purely on the fact that the cover <UNK> to me however as soon as the film began i had regrets it seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it they also used inappropriate ghostly faces and <UNK> to try and scare people but i found myself laughing i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it br br as for the plot i felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed it had no direction br br i didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on definitely <UNK> of my life wasted br br i would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched <UNK> <UNK> and find something that is more entertaining i'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after <UNK> <UNK> but this made me <UNK> a let down to its genre br br out of the star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them
<START> even in a bad film there is usually some redeeming feature something that you can say yes it was terrible but there was that performance or that part of the script or that special effect this was just simply terrible all over the acting was laughable the script terrible complete with many inexplicable breakfast at <UNK> references and even the special effects were shoddy at best this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was <UNK> from history watch it if you want to a suffer harsh self inflicted pain b see just how bad a film can be this is one film where i can use the cliché there's ninety minutes of my life i will never get back with some justification
<START> the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly <UNK> in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused br br i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and don't get <UNK> off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have 5 <UNK> planned why all this means is that there will be no answers for at least 4 years oh well i'll keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
<START> not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about <UNK> the characters seem almost <UNK> by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production it was very clearly made for tv yet if i found it on my television i would flick it straight over the children in the film do an alright job yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in this film lacked the music dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love johnson as annie is at times annoying and over acted you cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie the differences in character appearance continued to <UNK> me throughout the duration of the film sad to say this sequel was a total flop
<START> expecting to see a cute little film from <UNK> china i was ill prepared family dynamics community and the <UNK> of change have rarely been explored so expertly on film every character is solid and i was completely drawn into the story the organization is much more complex than american audiences will be <UNK> to yet there is no difficulty following the progression even while reading subtitles <UNK> wu as the retarded brother is a constant shining light leave your cynicism in your locker it will be there when you check out
<START> if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become this one would take the prize the plot centers around bible <UNK> that lie in hidden messages of the <UNK> that <UNK> a group of power seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be br br the acting was bad at best casper van <UNK> wasted his talent doing this film michael <UNK> work was a fair match for the role since he was the center of the film and did a good job br br this plot was sickening and very disturbing no tender or immature minds should see this film this is how a basic good vs evil plot can go <UNK> br br there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles who look for ways to market this type of junk there must have been something <UNK> out to get a pg 13 rating but it was still awful
<START> was so that i could in good conscience tell everyone how horrible this movie is i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself wow this is pretty bad and to be honest i would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for <UNK> <UNK> though he had very little screen time he's the movie's only well acted role which is a shame because i really like <UNK> <UNK> or at least i thought i did br br while watching this i started thinking back to his part in <UNK> redemption and realized it wasn't as good as i thought it was problem his jail house tough guy act seems like it's just that an act his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to i doubt it but maybe he should have br br and to make matters worse they've managed to <UNK> a little jail house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived especially when you consider that the <UNK> was being <UNK> by a <UNK> who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural br br i wouldn't normally slam a movie like this but when i saw the movie it had a fairly <UNK> review i felt like i was cheated and <UNK> to and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie br br i say <UNK>
<START> well i'd be lying if i said that this could easily rival <UNK> or the batman movies still it was more appealing to me for it's moral value i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite my wife and i are avid supporters of robert <UNK> and have been since he used credit cards to <UNK> his first movie hollywood <UNK> true he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical <UNK> to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun br br meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel i always felt that if there were <UNK> they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics meteor man is realistic hero with real problems car broken into bad neighborhood local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution etc the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community br br what i found to be truly entertaining outside of james earl jones' young forever performance was how the neighborhood <UNK> to his newly discovered powers it wasn't long before they had a full agenda <UNK> up for him without his <UNK> of course it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other <UNK> where their extended families lived br br yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks 1 with my kids robert <UNK> works to bring movies home so to speak i doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts br br one point to <UNK> about the film which i find amusing throughout the entire battle with simon no one bothered to call the police also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window my mother would have been right there <UNK> by my side toe to toe dad would be <UNK> his pistol lol br br rent it and check it out it's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bill <UNK> big daddy kane etc great job with the cameos robert
<START> at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon <UNK> delivers a firm strong <UNK> performance as derek bliss his <UNK> as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films the leading man no looking back but in case anyone is still wondering yes jon bon <UNK> can act he can act well and that's come to be expected of him it's easy to separate derek from the guy who <UNK> out hits on <UNK> 1 br br i generally would not watch a horror movie i've come to expect them to focus on <UNK> gore rather than dialogue and plot what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a <UNK> plot being moved along the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a <UNK> realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets so gore fans might be disappointed but story fans will not br br unlike an action film like u <UNK> where the dialogue takes a back seat to the <UNK> we get a chance to know the good guys and actually care what happens to them a few scenes are left unexplained like <UNK> hallucinations but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel unfortunately with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film that sequel will never happen these few instances are <UNK> knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series br br is this the best film i've ever seen in my life no is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained yes it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either if you're somewhere in between the horror genre <UNK> and the horror genre lover this film is for you it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story <UNK> each other br br
<START> half past dead starring steven seagal in the main role was a major b hit half past dead 2 is just a direct to video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something it's less entertaining than the first one in all aspects but it's although worthy a look if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not br br <UNK> did a good job bill goldberg was below the average i think he isn't made to the job <UNK> is a good comedian i say the rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright br br technical details well a production made by <UNK> can't be great cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable whatever just watch it if you want if you watch you won't lose anything but if you don't well you won't lose either
<START> am i missing something here unexpected plot developments plot <UNK> with <UNK> glee are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself in an now obvious sub un conscious bout of <UNK> i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever <UNK> this stinker this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved quick question did sir <UNK> read the script before he gave the thumbs up to kate c if so then it must be the same spielberg who <UNK> howard the duck don't give me that it was a hit play crap i'm guessing <UNK> <UNK> ain't too pleased the dvd cover promised surprising <UNK> and a twisted story story story it's crap like this that make old bobby <UNK> and his wandering band of <UNK> sound like geniuses sundance berlin toronto i have a home video of my cat <UNK> that evokes more interest than <UNK> <UNK> dimensional portrayal of <UNK> loss and talk about <UNK> ex <UNK> for mr stanley t thank god just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops and thank <UNK> that the cops had just caught the true killer what up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of <UNK> against arquette and his hidden millions no mrs spielberg you don't escape <UNK> what the hell was that kitchen scene with the <UNK> foot in my <UNK> gag are you worse in this or just cause i <UNK> hey film lovers why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with jersey girl and white chicks and then commit <UNK> or is it <UNK> and take e <UNK> with you
<START> br br i take issue with the other <UNK> comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film not a supernatural one it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation vampires but turns out to be a very <UNK> one br br other films that come to mind are edgar <UNK> before dawn and the more famous mark of the vampire br br the film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere similar dracula when <UNK> meets the count on the <UNK> of his castle or in mark of the vampire when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> using wings very surreal br br if one likes these often silent atmospheric touches this film is a must br br norm <UNK>
<START> i had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is sidney <UNK> best movie <UNK> had just returned from over a <UNK> break in film acting and he is clearly <UNK> here 11 of his films are mentioned in <UNK> and they don't include this 5 of his films are on the <UNK> list of top 100 inspiring movies again not including this berenger and <UNK> <UNK> and city <UNK> set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to canada some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and berenger and <UNK> bonding was <UNK> and awkward not helped by a completely bland script <UNK> alley as the hostage was underused and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen some attempt at suspense is made for example when you're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer all of them are type cast villains i understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there i guessed who it was and i wasn't really trying hard br br if you're a berenger fan watch the sniper 1993 you even get to see billy zane <UNK> his stuff it's much better all in all i'd give shoot to kill 3 10 it's not daring and it's just too straightforward for me
<START> the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes other than that this movie is a big dud we have kim basinger the <UNK> housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min of the movie which added nothing then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 <UNK> who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy <UNK> eve they begin to chase her after <UNK> the local security guard who tried to help her from there this movie gets worse way worse i know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min <UNK> and she can't hide or find someone to help her instead she drives to a half built <UNK> beside a forest in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her but now she turns into one tough <UNK> you get the point do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type it's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene it is embarrassing for basinger and craig <UNK> and the rest of the cast as well as the <UNK>
<START> there's more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films felix <UNK> the poor guy's <UNK> even <UNK> him <UNK> into a new york hotel a cleaning lady says good night goodbye he answers back in his room he <UNK> his <UNK> then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an <UNK> addressed to his wife and beloved children when the viewer finally puts it together  <UNK> he's going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no he's going to jump  the poor guy <UNK> his lower back this is all you need to know about felix <UNK>  his wife has left him he's a <UNK> <UNK> and he's a <UNK> and all in one scene this is the particular genius of neil simon's comedy  it's about situation and character there are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the <UNK> no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations and of course he is a master of <UNK> the audience's expectations coming from the <UNK> era imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts <UNK> about the <UNK> of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment he's blowing it right think again the girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them they invite him back to their place since his <UNK> has burned because oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it he's in like flynn right uh yes but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable great stuff and it's made even greater with a style that <UNK> editing and <UNK> the wonderful eight room apartment set you've got jack lemmon and the <UNK> <UNK> walter matthau for <UNK> why mess it up the visual style reminded me of breakfast at <UNK> in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action particularly memorable is the scene in which felix fleeing from oscar <UNK> a <UNK> only to realize the <UNK> doesn't cover the side where oscar is coming from you get a real sense of the <UNK> of the apartment and thus the <UNK> in which the two <UNK> live the twist here is that these two are really married  to each other so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys
<START> there are some redeeming qualities to this show one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody the show does have a nice premise also i am probably in the minority but i like <UNK> i like the fact she is caring and is more a mother figure to timmy however despite all this i do not like this show it isn't <UNK> but i do find it very annoying br br i wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on planet earth when i use that term for an animated tv show i think of peter pan and the pirates i think of <UNK> duck i think of scooby doo and i think of <UNK> and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild <UNK> and <UNK> the fact it gets <UNK> fun at nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth i accept it's annoying and in some ways overrated but it isn't the worst show on <UNK> that is <UNK> zone god that show is unwatchable but the worst animated show i've ever seen is shaggy and scooby doo get a clue which is <UNK> animated unfunny and frankly a disgrace br br one thing i don't like about this show is the animation the characters forgive me if i offend have very weird facial features and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make <UNK> <UNK> and wild <UNK> so nice to look at the characters with the exception of <UNK> i find very annoying i can't believe such a talented voice actress like tara strong aka <UNK> voiced timmy timmy i don't find very likable as a lead character at all he is annoying and sometimes <UNK> and he is a poor decision maker as well and his voice gets on my nerves i actually like strong but not in this show another annoying character is <UNK> the supposedly funny character instead his jokes are as unfunny as they could become they are either a contrived or b over familiar <UNK> parents are awful characters who don't give a toss about their son and their personalities wear well thin br br the story lines are very unoriginal on the most part and i keep thinking where have i seen this before the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable even worse is the scripts very unfunny childish witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy br br all in all not the worst show ever but pretty poor for an animation fan and fairly uncomfortable to sit through 3 10 there are redeeming qualities and i completely understand if people like it <UNK> cox
<START> the acting may be okay the more u watch this movie the more u wish you weren't this movie is so horrible that if i could get a hold of every copy i would burn them all and not look back this movie is terrible
<START> this movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting br br this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian <UNK> managed to stop the heavy water production in <UNK> <UNK> and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany br br this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the <UNK> are played by themselves br br if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look
<START> i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me after a few times i get bored and changed the channel i still love robert <UNK> and patricia <UNK> and ray <UNK> in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others first robert <UNK> plays an investigator for ray <UNK> character he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia <UNK> to see if she is having an affair in return <UNK> character <UNK> the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career out of anger <UNK> kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere i don't know maybe i just didn't care for this one at all of course columbo gets him in the end it's just the question of how
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is as good a <UNK> as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has <UNK> in the past 40 years then in the late 60s while the big hollywood studios were on the <UNK> italy france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood's decline there were the james bond pictures doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 <UNK> afternoon admission price the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns with a <UNK> of dollars released by a <UNK> that never paid the italian producers a dime and french crime movies that usually went to art houses with exceptions like the <UNK> clan and there were european co productions like doctor <UNK> and of course <UNK> <UNK> with its big budget for the time and the world talent involved <UNK> <UNK> was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later br br kenneth more playing a british intelligence officer has a line in <UNK> <UNK> where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game the wall being opposite a firing squad with little chance of the spy winning the game that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders in the vietnam war era of 1969 br br the steamy scenes between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> probably did not damage these <UNK> chances at getting parts in hollywood movies hollywood studios were in the process of <UNK> their overseas distribution and production <UNK> fox would no longer co produce films like the <UNK> clan columbia wouldn't <UNK> films like <UNK> the night <UNK> mgm went even further cutting almost all film production selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and <UNK> its <UNK> studio <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas where a <UNK> casino gift shop sold mgm <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> stuff left over from the <UNK> of <UNK> prop <UNK> br br paramount distributed <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> and <UNK> charles <UNK> who had taken over the company and <UNK> the <UNK> aged board of directors <UNK> the <UNK> film library to universal as i recall and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another but that was in the 70s <UNK> <UNK> with its lesbian scene was buried with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s br br kenneth more was usually <UNK> as a bumbling guy when he was older especially in the bbc detective series father brown when he was younger as in the british movie titanic he played his standard reserved british officer in <UNK> <UNK> he had a chance to be a lot <UNK> than usual as i recall it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate about his role and of course those <UNK> horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle that was some scene and <UNK> <UNK> showed he was some director <UNK> this world war i espionage movie where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen
<START> nina <UNK> insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george <UNK> it's short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer br br when i was growing up <UNK> was a <UNK> on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she's a pretty young <UNK> playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the <UNK> agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend br br it's a live in situation once julia gets to the house she's drugged and when she wakes up she's told she's mrs hughes and not allowed to leave br br the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it
<START> this is simply the worst movie i've ever seen neither of the three central characters has any charm and <UNK> good looks aren't enough to carry the film the <UNK> plot i've ever had inflicted upon me also the most unconvincing military comedy ever why did they bother
<START> dolph lundgren stars as a <UNK> who comes to new york when a key that <UNK> the anti christ is found by an <UNK> of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn't killed so easily as he <UNK> from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jean claude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever they're on tv i caught the <UNK> and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight <UNK> worst of all is <UNK> woefully unconvincing <UNK> as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i've seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it it's awful and it's the lowest point in <UNK> career and i saw cover up the last warrior and masters of the universe br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget <UNK> ever made i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad but i made an exception for this one and i was very glad that i did br br it's filled to the <UNK> with action much of it surprisingly <UNK> gory sleaze isolated to nudity with a key female character but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious and outrageously awkward dialogue all of which adds to the laughter inducing tone of the film br br <UNK> the unusual looking star of the <UNK> and countless other low budget action <UNK> is amusing in the lead giving the best performance he could <UNK> <UNK> is better than usual clearly <UNK> it up with <UNK> glee and he doesn't come in until <UNK> through the rest of the cast is also fun to watch particularly the villains one of whom is a sadistic <UNK> who speaks with an accent that appears to be a <UNK> mash of spanish and italian she's priceless br br again i can't stress enough how gory it was it's not so bloody that it's nauseating but it's <UNK> violent in parts with some <UNK> <UNK> going off in the <UNK> and it has a <UNK> torture sequence that no man will soon forget also when <UNK> is being <UNK> by a pack of bad guys he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and <UNK> their beers br br don't miss white fire it's a <UNK> if mind numbingly stupid action classic
<START> we toss around the term superstar way too lightly these days but here's one guy that truly deserves it br br i was glued to the set this entire show the song selection was perfect it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very <UNK> environment with songs of this strength you don't need a circus to be entertained br br the shots of the crowd were amazing too how many performers can affect the original beatles fans now in their 50's and beyond get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of can't buy me love and impact everyone in between br br while watching i also realized that in the wake of john <UNK> tragic death paul <UNK> instantly became an <UNK> paul not only lost john and george no matter what their final relations were it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the <UNK> <UNK> murder received i agree that <UNK> murder was horrible but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath i was very happy that he's found love again in heather br br as for those complaining about the audio video quality i had no complaints whatsoever both were crystal clear on my set i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out they'll never be satisfied br br my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it br br when people remember john lennon they will first remember his murder and then his music i now have a new appreciation for paul <UNK> because if nothing else he will be remembered for his music first and let's hope another lunatic won't change this because the <UNK> <UNK> is pretty good
<START> i had a vague idea of who bettie page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her santa hat just that she didn't know what the <UNK> was the movie co written and directed by american <UNK> mary harron <UNK> out the key parts of her life well enough a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in new york city where she gets into <UNK> and from there a lot more soon she becomes the underground pin up sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title <UNK> attributed to her the actress gretchen <UNK> portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film she's not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well adam and eve were naked weren't they she comments a couple of times apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of <UNK> life and leave off with her in a kind of <UNK> period leaving behind the photo shoots for jesus br br in all the <UNK> bettie page is not much more than a kind of usual bio <UNK> presented by hbo films albeit this time with the <UNK> for a feature film release the best scenes that harron captures are page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in over the top poses and starring in ridiculous films of <UNK> and chains and leather uniforms this adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature it's not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the <UNK> investigation into the <UNK> that came out of such photos and underground magazines but there isn't much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with page and her <UNK> or her relationships or to sex and the fifties it's all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if harron was <UNK> some of the black and white photos to be <UNK> more as it went along it's a watchable view if you're not too <UNK> of bette page and probably for fans too
<START> i saw this film yesterday i must admit it weren't my cup of tea although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind but as i was watching this i was thinking <UNK> movie isn't making any sense at all ' where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind where on earth did a shark came out from br br all these elements in this film somehow didn't add up i felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap br br i've seen many good horror movies in my time but this is one of the most worst horror flicks i've seen at the end of the movie i said to myself that i wouldn't watch it again so much <UNK> show in this film i've decided to give it the thumbs down count me out on this one 0 out of 10
<START> you better see this episode from the beginning because if you start to watch it any later you will be confused as to what is happening to <UNK> life br br yet that is the twist clark is stuck in an alternate reality <UNK> is devoted to him lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he <UNK> to miss clark in the pilot of the series martha is married to lionel about the only constant is his most loyal friend chloe who still believes in who he is and oh yeah he doesn't have any <UNK> he is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers and is <UNK> for believing so aside from chloe there is one mysterious figure who believes in clark a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution who believes he is from mars br br clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality and not get <UNK> by the <UNK> psychiatrist who is in fact the fourth phantom zone <UNK> br br this episode is utterly mind blowing and shocking plus it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of <UNK> episode
<START> i haven't laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too especially when it changes from hyper funny to honest and serious the characters are very realistic most of the times sappy sometimes but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel sorry for the <UNK> people this film instead is a satire and it is doing great br br too bad that all <UNK> were <UNK> out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it br br
<START> this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan <UNK> says <UNK> <UNK> when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as <UNK> <UNK> they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies aren't cheesy
<START> <UNK> 2000 br br aspect ratio 2 35 1 <UNK> br br sound format <UNK> br br whilst visiting rome an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> falls in love with a beautiful young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but their unlikely romance is opposed by <UNK> wealthy father <UNK> <UNK> and fate deals a tragic blow br br a <UNK> up love story for the swinging sixties adapted from a literary source alexandre <UNK> <UNK> dame <UNK> <UNK> by screenwriter michael <UNK> and directed with <UNK> flair by <UNK> <UNK> who along with the likes of russ meyer and joe <UNK> is credited with <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's using the scope format for the last time in his career <UNK> exploration of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is rich in visual excess note the emphasis on <UNK> <UNK> for example though the film's sexual <UNK> seems <UNK> <UNK> by modern standards production values are handsome throughout and the performances are engaging and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are particularly memorable despite weak post sync dubbing though set in an <UNK> future <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation <UNK> ultimately <UNK> 2000 is an acquired taste but fans of this director's elegant <UNK> <UNK> won't be disappointed next up for <UNK> was the <UNK> <UNK> 1970 which many consider his best film
<START> thanks to this <UNK> film i do not want my <UNK> can't stomach the thought of <UNK> or <UNK> and even that <UNK> over there doesn't look so innocent anymore why wasn't the song <UNK> time by the <UNK> used as the theme
<START> this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour loosely <UNK> a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of <UNK> perverted sex greed violence and <UNK> all the action is played out over a few very hot and <UNK> days during a <UNK> in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode closely followed by the scenes of <UNK> and <UNK> in the <UNK> flat you will be <UNK> and i hope horrified by this film i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through 1 10 for <UNK> 8 10 for displaying <UNK> as he sometimes is
<START> i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that <UNK> the sheer pointless stupidity and <UNK> of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his <UNK> friend the sheriff have finally <UNK> the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an <UNK> <UNK> plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the <UNK> for nearly the entire film and that the <UNK> has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that <UNK> is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood br br so the sheriff has his gun pointed at <UNK> who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now br br the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it's obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some <UNK> devices a <UNK> or <UNK> or a net or some <UNK> <UNK> or maybe a new age tape by <UNK> to <UNK> the savage beast br br so the sheriff <UNK> and shoots the melting man goes <UNK> and hilarity ensues br br maybe this explains why <UNK> has been <UNK> around with the space <UNK> program in sub <UNK> space for the last 30 years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i <UNK> br br anyway that's the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that <UNK> every aspect of this movie it's hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characters br br two other incredibly painful sequences also <UNK> up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the <UNK> old couple in the world trying to steal <UNK> from a <UNK> only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a <UNK> in 70s cinema i can guarantee you've never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with <UNK> looking people in your entire life and the melting man's assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who <UNK> on the walls defies every attempt to process it btw i think famous film director <UNK> <UNK> has a walk on in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been <UNK> on it and we are forced to watch her <UNK> for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot br br <UNK> <UNK> ought to beat the crap out of <UNK> director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here no one's idea of a leading man but solid and <UNK> but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here br br everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i ain't laughing but not much br br this definitely falls into the <UNK> bad you can't look <UNK> category of cinema disasters still i'd watch it again before i'd watch a lot of other 70's and 80's <UNK> track of the <UNK> and it lives by night come to mind and <UNK> coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the <UNK> version
<START> i have never <UNK> a film on line but i felt moved to do so after seeing this one one doesn't show up at someone's funeral and say to the <UNK> my relatives died so why should i care about yours br br minus the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art as the daughter of deaf parents i was particularly annoyed by the use of <UNK> as a gimmick any deaf person feeling a <UNK> of that <UNK> would likely have <UNK> not ignored it br br the word <UNK> comes to mind as a writer there are few subjects i would stay away from the holocaust is one this is another i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant and inept
<START> a new way to enjoy <UNK> work rivers and <UNK> allows fans to see his work in motion watching goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone <UNK> and thorn that he uses goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the <UNK> <UNK> and affects his work although i was happy the film covered the majority of <UNK> pieces no <UNK> i do feel it was a bit long the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing <UNK> work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch
