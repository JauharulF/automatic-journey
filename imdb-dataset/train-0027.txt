<START> this was a <UNK> event in my movie watching life i went to see this in the theater when it came out i was completely amazed at just how bad it was movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who <UNK> whom a favor a very very large favor the special effects are absolutely first grade level as in any first <UNK> could have done them toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings <UNK> that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign and a laughable story line ed wood made masterpieces compared to conquest every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie
<START> i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese <UNK> portrayal of dani <UNK> a 14 year old <UNK> in rural <UNK> circa 1957 she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister maureen a now rarely seen emily <UNK> and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative <UNK> upbringing then <UNK> year old court foster jason london the son of her mother's close friend <UNK> <UNK> moves in next door dani experiences her first crush while court enjoys her company and <UNK> spirit dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving dani behind the <UNK> close bond is <UNK> severely by the rivalry that <UNK> which only <UNK> when court dies in a tragic accident the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other br br sam <UNK> and tess <UNK> are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their <UNK> <UNK> at the same time trying to keep the family together the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis <UNK> the <UNK> and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time br br a touching coming of age film with a timeless message
<START> i read the reviews before i watched this movie and i didn't believe them i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average it wasn't this film makes camp blood 1 and 2 look like <UNK> the film contains bad acting poor sound poor confusing storyline bad makeup and it bored me so much i turned it off even the nudity was rubbish did they even have a budget for this film i don't think they did you can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic <UNK> 4 or even camp blood avoid this trash i watched it on tv and felt <UNK> off so don't spend anything on it the best part is probably the end
<START> this film tells the story of a romance between albert <UNK> niece and a gas station attendant in order to get the two together <UNK> agrees to help ed <UNK> <UNK> tim robbins learn to act more intelligent this <UNK> catherine meg ryan unfortunately <UNK> goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius hilarity ensues not to be missed filmed in <UNK> county new jersey at <UNK> university <UNK> <UNK> school <UNK> for <UNK> university as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in <UNK>
<START> i would like to comment on the movie april love it's one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse <UNK> i remember distinctly when hollywood came to <UNK> <UNK> where we were living at the time to make april love my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home w the script how exciting is that also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes especially the ones shown at the amusement park it's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat <UNK> is still played on the radio timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w all the sex foul language and violence it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus
<START> i would list this film under the horror film genre i did this because i am not aware of a genre called horrible since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible i have decided to put it in this category the acting was amateurish you know who the villains would be at the first scene the heroine is as ugly as the movie students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie it is that bad man the word bad is an understatement the villains <UNK> an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars they want the money to be delivered on an inhabited rose island in the middle of the pacific they would be sitting <UNK> after they got the money is there no <UNK> plan how dumb the female cruise director is a former cop navy seal kung fu i am scared the hilarious part is the way the <UNK> the time bomb he says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the <UNK> one by one he then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place is he mad as mad us who watched this ridiculous if you have a m i l whom you do not like to annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it i assure you she will definitely tell your <UNK> that you have such bad taste and that her son daughter has married a person below her family standard
<START> this movie deserved better it's great fun has some wonderful jokes and sight gags some in stuff for the <UNK> amongst us and we know who we are and the effects are indeed <UNK> watching paul <UNK> fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone i never read the comics series before i saw the movie but have since as good as they are i still recommend <UNK> the film although having the <UNK> <UNK> as a character would have been cool too greg kinnear is well amazing as captain amazing and no one else could be the <UNK> except william h macy my favorite line in the film we've got a blind date with destiny and it looks like she's ordered the <UNK> see this film buy this film it's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal mart you'll thank me really you will oh and ms <UNK> is in it that alone makes it watch worthy
<START> to be honest i didn't watch all of the original <UNK> but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie so great that seven horrible sequels had to be made they started off with howling ii your sister is a werewolf i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when <UNK> was brand new i just watched it last night and it wasn't really bad it was just weird i mean the whole thing with <UNK> <UNK> going three way with two of her werewolf <UNK> was just out of place and quite disturbing but kinda hot christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire etc actually this movie was actually like some sort of <UNK> mash of dracula and the lost boys except with werewolves because everything christopher lee whom played dracula himself was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie stake in the heart <UNK> the creature of the night must die at night and the <UNK> of werewolves lives in <UNK> not much for the acting but the worst of it came from annie <UNK> i swear at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out because that damn throat always had to say something anyway the plot is pretty silly and clich√©d so there's no real point in telling you you could just read about it on <UNK> by the way the thing that really makes me <UNK> about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original not counting howling iv 1988 which was a remake of the original or in other words a sequel based on the same novel so don't see this movie there's no real horror hardly any werewolves and just horrible special fx 3 10
<START> this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british <UNK> and her father traveling by <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is <UNK> she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to <UNK> out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your <UNK> of this most incredible man this is a must see
<START> it's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us i found it through a rare video dealer and it was certainly worth it this is without a doubt the best film made during the pre code era and the finest film of the 1930s masterful director frank <UNK> made wonderful films about the depression and with man's castle he created a fairy tale amidst the <UNK> of the era br br loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and they help make this movie a wonderful romance <UNK> <UNK> is sweet and hopeful while <UNK> bill is gruff and closed off the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult but in the end rewarding relationships on film br br man's castle is the most soft focus pre code film i've seen <UNK> uses the <UNK> and dreamy technique to turn the <UNK> village where bill and <UNK> live into a palace the <UNK> of the depression are never ignored in fact they're integral to the film but as <UNK> <UNK> the film as a soft focus fairy tale the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh it makes the film warm and <UNK> br br man's castle is the <UNK> achievement of the pre code era if only more people could see it
<START> i think that this movie is very neat you <UNK> like michael jackson or you don't but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see
<START> not only do the <UNK> in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can <UNK> that claim james gandolfini who plays the lead man tony soprano has become in this viewer's opinion one of the hollywood <UNK> as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldn't go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since 1999 gandolfini has <UNK> so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and it's not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of <UNK> <UNK> edie <UNK> michael <UNK> dominic <UNK> and the late nancy <UNK> who played tony's dreadful mother at this point in the show's existence it's being considered a cult classic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 season 4 which wrapped up right before new years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dry spell i still found it season 4 of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately i've been <UNK> a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield <UNK> your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close i'd like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time
<START> this movie is bad if you are thinking about watching it there is only one decent scene in the movie and it lasts about 5 seconds amanda <UNK> topless scene the rest of the movie is horrible i think high school plays probably have better acting the plot makes no sense at all the set was pretty lame and it wasn't even good to make fun of it was just dull and very very bad i watched this on <UNK> so i thought it had to be at least decent the mini description sounded like it'd be alright the girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie after you have to watch some horrible music video the transitions between scenes are very abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them just cuts from one scene to another no <UNK> kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is to explaining why the plot sucks the audio gets low at some points where you can barely hear it then gets loud with gay <UNK> <UNK> thrown in at random points in the movie it is the same sound every time this is now officially the worst movie i have ever seen br br acting 0 10 effects 1 10 storyline 0 10 music 3 10 br br lame <UNK> 1 000 000 10
<START> i was probably one of the few <UNK> not watching the <UNK> when this series aired i have to say when william <UNK> first appeared i though that is one crappy actor but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh i watched the show to see hugo <UNK> heart and bones the full monty and tom long <UNK> two hands it was interesting to see <UNK> play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sigh seriously <UNK> performance was a total shock and really brilliant he stole the show martin <UNK> was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance i'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on
<START> from the start you know this is a sam <UNK> film more than an al <UNK> film because as the credits roll a sam <UNK> production appears in letters as big as the title credit not only that mr <UNK> co wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use bob <UNK> a washed up <UNK> year old western star of the old hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that <UNK> thought would capitalize on the recent success of swinging <UNK> br br now why would you want to have a <UNK> old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft core exploitation feature it defies explanation but that is sam <UNK> for you his obsession with old hollywood colored a lot of his films for independent international pictures and he and al <UNK> frequently tried to get has been actors for their films e g j <UNK> <UNK> russ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr etc but bob <UNK> tell me the drive in <UNK> knew who this <UNK> second <UNK> was it's ridiculous br br but then again naughty <UNK> was a successful picture for them so we can't just write this off as a <UNK> fiasco still by any aesthetic standard it's an incoherent mess al <UNK> wanted out of this picture and it is easy to see why first off it has no genre focus at all and <UNK> around from super soft core tits and ass <UNK> sex only to a kidnapping thriller shades of <UNK> rat <UNK> and boo boo in between we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the <UNK> <UNK> around vegas to the hackneyed music of <UNK> or richard <UNK> and connie <UNK> on a photo shoot in san francisco worst of all we get bob <UNK> as a jack <UNK> wannabe in a blue <UNK> trying to be sexy gag thankfully his big sex scene with connie <UNK> was deleted but you can catch him <UNK> on her <UNK> on the dvd in the special features section creepy br br this is a terrible terrible movie but i'll give it three stars for gary <UNK> photography and out of sympathy to connie <UNK> for having to make it with <UNK> <UNK> naughty <UNK> is for al <UNK> <UNK> and or <UNK> of exploitation film as sam <UNK> commentary offers vital inside info all others beware
<START> all dogs go to heaven is in my opinion the best animated film ever made i'm not really a big fan of animated films but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film i've seen the music is wonderful as is the performances of burt reynolds dom <UNK> and especially ken page as the king <UNK> let's make music together is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical i've seen this is definitely a must see for people of all ages
<START> i am very <UNK> of really bad sci fi and horror movies i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5 so i've seen some really bad stuff but i deal with it i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of hope springs eternal i guess or the triumph of hope over experience as they say unfortunately this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it but like a <UNK> to the flame i kept thinking something anything interesting would happen it doesn't all of the actors give a decent performance given the script i don't know how they all kept straight faces it has something to do with <UNK> <UNK> worm <UNK> creatures who are slowly taking over the human race one body at a time there's an evil plastic surgeon who <UNK> with the enemy by giving them the <UNK> appearance of humans don't worry he gets what's coming to him the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from they think they might have <UNK> a ride on a meteor that landed on earth but somehow they know about the members of slug <UNK> among them the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self oh must i go on please i <UNK> you do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this anything would be better think of the worst least enjoyable way you can spend two hours it would be better than this
<START> here's a decent mid 70's horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old <UNK> seems like there's lots of gates of hell around but of course this <UNK> model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend fianc√©e and so she just happens to pick one which is disguised as a nice and reasonably <UNK> apartment she meets several strange neighbors and even <UNK> a birthday party for a cat upon meeting with the <UNK> because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only <UNK> <UNK> then who are all these <UNK> her boyfriend a slimy lawyer played by chris sarandon starts <UNK> around and finds that things are not what they seem not by a long shot this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the <UNK> old folks that are her sometimes neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less than normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch and while i've seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better of course not a bad little horror flick maybe a good companion piece to burnt offerings 8 out of 10
<START> yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can br br boring direction and performances with the exception of the lovely <UNK> <UNK> who is much <UNK> as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the ever earnest charlton heston earn the rating of a real stinker br br it's amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is he even plays in a sub plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie the way they ended up <UNK> it was that they didn't it simply falls off the end br br really don't waste your time on this one
<START> it is not as great a film as many people believe including my late aunt who said it was her favorite movie but due to the better sections of this film noir particularly that <UNK> famous fun house finale the lady from shanghai has gained a position of importance beyond it's actual worth as a key to the saga of orson welles' failure to <UNK> hollywood br br by 1946 welles' position as a hollywood figure was mixed citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the <UNK> press and by hollywood <UNK> themselves welles' attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to <UNK> the whole system his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre supposedly shot by robert stevenson but actually shot in large measure with <UNK> <UNK> by welles but the credit went to stevenson only the stranger a film <UNK> from a <UNK> interest in fleeing nazi war criminals made a profit for five years in hollywood it was barely a great record br br welles returned to broadway in 1946 hoping to <UNK> his critical abilities by his production of around the world in 80 days but despite the assistance mike todd and cole porter <UNK> the score the musical was a failure his failure occurred just at the same time that his wife rita hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of <UNK> so the marriage was going on the rocks as well br br welles had to make money his broadway production had led to his personal <UNK> he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd which he would eventually <UNK> and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of <UNK> desire <UNK> to charlie chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into <UNK> <UNK> br br the story goes that welles with a 10 000 00 tax bill to worry about called <UNK> and offered to do a film with rita for a down <UNK> <UNK> was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was it was a wise question welles was on a pay phone in new york in a <UNK> that had a book department he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai and <UNK> that it was a great thriller somehow welles convinced the normally <UNK> <UNK> that welles knew what he was talking about <UNK> said he'd look into getting the rights and sent welles his down <UNK> of 10 000 00 after <UNK> hung up welles bought the book and read it and found it was really pretty bad he spent time <UNK> a treatment and screenplay that would build up <UNK> character of elsa <UNK> br br certainly it has a curious plot development michael o'hara is a <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> elsa <UNK> when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in san francisco elsa is married to arthur <UNK> everett sloane a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation she convinces him to hire michael as the <UNK> of their <UNK> the cruise also contains <UNK> sinister partner george <UNK> glenn <UNK> and one sidney <UNK> ted de <UNK> who turns out to be a detective hired by <UNK> to watch elsa when they can michael and elsa try to find time together but <UNK> or <UNK> keeps showing up br br <UNK> makes michael an offer he wants for reasons connected to his so called <UNK> view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead according to <UNK> the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the south <UNK> he will pay michael 10 000 00 if he will pretend to shoot <UNK> this includes actually <UNK> a document <UNK> to the murder michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that <UNK> is probably dead br br of course <UNK> is killed and michael is arrested for that and for the murder of <UNK> shot with michael's gun michael is tried with <UNK> defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted michael is convinced that <UNK> is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict he is knocked out and <UNK> in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the film br br it's a terribly confusing movie as i have had commented on that does not mean it's not worth seeing visually it is striking witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial <UNK> quarters where he knocks the <UNK> into the <UNK> <UNK> shattering glass or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting is pretty good in particular sloane possibly that fine actor's best film role glenn <UNK> was a leading broadway performer he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai and his slimy <UNK> is unforgettable also ted de <UNK> does very nicely with <UNK> a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own cost br br as for hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before blood and sand tales of manhattan and the <UNK> blond are exceptions and is a memorable <UNK> welles' o'hara is a very unusual character for the actor a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe it's not kane <UNK> othello touch of evil or <UNK> at midnight but it is a good film for all that
<START> the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans aren't as they should be from players with marital problems to drug <UNK> to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined br br despite what you might think when you first read about <UNK> this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead <UNK> is another of those lousy soap opera ish 70s made for tv movies populated with hollywood has <UNK> and those that never will be the cast <UNK> its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hit man yeah right it's about as believable as the affair she has with the <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film <UNK> whatever flow <UNK> might have had with no drama or suspense in sight <UNK> ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made for tv movie the lone highlight for me was the voice over work from the late charlie jones a <UNK> i miss listening to the <UNK> way he <UNK> the intrigue and over <UNK> the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest br br like most others who have seen <UNK> i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 it may be one of the <UNK> public access episodes but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though i've only rated <UNK> a 2 10 i'll give this episode a generous 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> i saw this director's woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog <UNK> through very little and become enchanted with <UNK> pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film don't let my review stop you i do like <UNK> in films but i feel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee <UNK> <UNK> in his films there is nothing here i wish <UNK> liked it but i don't oh well
<START> this is the worst and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen the whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity br br i mean br br the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person now you probably think this must be some super cool high tech computer well it is but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic <UNK> br br and the main idea how to <UNK> the super computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid my mobile phone will shut the lighting down to <UNK> the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security <UNK> or to load computer games br br there are also some other bad things about it but i just don't have time for this br br i just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
<START> ok this is the third in the series of <UNK> lets star with the dinosaur puppets in the start of the film you cant see the <UNK> cause when the body count starts you can only see the <UNK> eye vision pretty smart to hide the bad puppets and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader <UNK> the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead <UNK> after the <UNK> rampage after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a <UNK> scream pretty creepy and then a black girl walks forward and now one <UNK> is found it pops up a <UNK> hand and <UNK> her face but if you pause when the <UNK> hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet wtf the story is simple 1 some <UNK> attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there 2 they where dead wrong it <UNK> to be ten tons <UNK> and one giant t rex in there how did the t rex fit in there 3 <UNK> and some <UNK> will kill the dinosaurs sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive 4 holy <UNK> the <UNK> have <UNK> on their <UNK> 5 the <UNK> is now on a boat in the pacific 6 strange i didn't know that the t rex had a strange thing on hes neck 7 the end the film is good if you want a good laugh 5 10
<START> my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the <UNK> fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood but even women enjoy the film and especially <UNK> kate <UNK> <UNK> boys are so weird it's refreshing to see a film that <UNK> shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out we had even more fun the second time around and everyone <UNK> about it it's clean and delightfully acted by a pre adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic freaks and <UNK> we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the freaks <UNK> which didn't survive its first season but sold out its dvd release do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it <UNK> conversation about fun and safety girls will love it because of the opportunity it <UNK> to say boys are so weird don't miss it
<START> an attempt at <UNK> to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera <UNK> the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is <UNK> in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who <UNK> his throat which has suddenly become <UNK> br br only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie <UNK> that opinion his <UNK> lies in not <UNK> the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he <UNK> this one br br who knows except those involved do we need to know br br the plot is weak and trite this movie is like <UNK> through cold mud to pick off a few <UNK> <UNK> the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isn't one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocal concert <UNK> and recognize the master <UNK> where he is most suited br br it would be one of <UNK> 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and <UNK> to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script br br i give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of <UNK> singing and of opera because of this movie
<START> this movie was great it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth the animation was somewhat odd but nothing new from disney it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing br br the background animation was magical it was a different level of work for the disney people some of the characters were a little <UNK> but it was more than made up for with the beauty and <UNK> of the scenery the music was largely <UNK> but that was perfect for the movie this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song br br perfect 10 out of 10
<START> i saw only the first part of this series when it <UNK> back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix convenient service by the way all in all i liked this lighthearted sometimes genre challenged mini series the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine yes it does have some romance clich√©s of running in the rain or a train station goodbye but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar <UNK> greene who at times reminds me of a separated at birth scott <UNK> does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the <UNK> and tide of desire and <UNK> throws the series into watchable fare personally i think the series could have been done with two episodes but that's up for debate i suppose apparently there's a sequel and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix
<START> chinese ghost story is one of the most amazing hong kong films i have ever seen it's a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror and martial arts the film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue truly original and refreshing film and another <UNK> fine recommendation
<START> now don't get me wrong if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to <UNK> future for mankind who better to turn to than a comedian and <UNK> of pop culture if you need a healthy dose of all the solid sound reasons why religion has <UNK> it's <UNK> then turn to <UNK> or <UNK> not bill <UNK> for god's sake that's a good point in and of itself <UNK> <UNK> our religious past as a <UNK> disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society art and science is <UNK> in it br br in this film he relies heavily on his <UNK> <UNK> skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear <UNK> and wise unfortunately his intellect isn't up to the task br br <UNK> makes us laugh but is clearly not the <UNK> <UNK> in the box as an example he responds to an <UNK> and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all <UNK> <UNK> that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan no it's not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the <UNK> <UNK> a device <UNK> <UNK> in this film the problem is that the person was correct and <UNK> dead wrong in his <UNK> that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect <UNK> i guess mr <UNK> has never read the contemporary <UNK> <UNK> br br but the masses will flock to this pseudo documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore and they will <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they certainly did at my showing br br it's <UNK> telling however that the <UNK> and most <UNK> like <UNK> occurred during the approximately 70 of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti christian <UNK> while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 devoted to <UNK> the self described religion of peace hmmm either criticism of islam is off limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh very telling either way
<START> the last couple of weeks in the life of a dead <UNK> woman is told in flashbacks like the <UNK> the film wanders <UNK> and rather <UNK> <UNK> the lazy <UNK> and drug addicted title character is not likable and <UNK> does little to make her interesting although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why <UNK> has chosen this miserable lifestyle her motivations are never really clear the episodic nature of the film involving some random characters becomes tiresome after a while making it seem much longer than its running time it is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men
<START> the cast is excellent the acting good the plot interesting the <UNK> full of suspense but it is hard to <UNK> all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots it would have a much better effect another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one
<START> deanna durbin really did save universal from <UNK> and <UNK> it to remain a big studio by the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at universal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> had gone only james whale remained but his <UNK> horror films were behind him deanna and judy garland appeared in a short every sunday and initially garland was suggested for the role of penny in three smart girls when garland was <UNK> universal switched to durbin initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was <UNK> to make her the star directed by henry <UNK> the film had a european touch br br the film starts with a beautiful <UNK> of a lake in switzerland the three smart girls of the title three sisters joan <UNK> grey kay barbara read and penny deanna durbin are <UNK> with penny giving her glorious voice to my heart is singing all is not too well on the home front their father is planning to <UNK> a younger woman <UNK> barnes so the three girls with the help of their <UNK> nurse lucille watson decide to go to new york and reunite him with their mother lucille watson is best remembered for her role as robert <UNK> stern mother in <UNK> bridge 1941 br br donna is a gold <UNK> who along with her <UNK> mother alice brady is determined to marry <UNK> craig charles <UNK> for someone with no film experience deanna is wonderful as penny a typical <UNK> over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture when she sings someone to care for me to her father you will just melt what a glorious voice she had she also has one of the funniest lines in the film when her father <UNK> her with i'll take you to the <UNK> tomorrow she replies oh i can see enough monkeys around here br br with the help of bill evans john king they decide to hire a count <UNK> <UNK> to romance donna they <UNK> to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix up lord michael stuart ray <UNK> is mistaken for the count and donna falls for him she thinks he owns half of australia the plan <UNK> as he falls for kay and donna wants to <UNK> her marriage to <UNK> br br penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away she is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of <UNK> <UNK> she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer everything ends happily with their mother <UNK> walker <UNK> over to <UNK> things up with their dad and in the meantime donna makes the <UNK> of the <UNK> count <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> off to australia with him br br highly recommended
<START> there is a certain genius behind this movie i was laughing throughout the scene in the phone sex office discussing how love <UNK> the <UNK> was a nice attempt at this genius humor execution is poor but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent the <UNK> split at the end was like ok wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way br br is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level i'm easily bored by many movies but this one kept my interest throughout br br i think the story may have some auto <UNK> roots but that's just a guess horribly bad but good i'm looking for other movies this person may have done with more experience
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the <UNK> i don't want to tell the plot because it's not what's most important about this film but you can be sure that it's interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of <UNK> <UNK> is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you <UNK> with its beauty br br as for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple <UNK> nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes <UNK> <UNK> even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed
<START> an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west john wayne as america's first <UNK> to japan arrives in <UNK> with <UNK> resulting from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he is not welcome wayne eventually wins his meeting with the <UNK> after bring a <UNK> <UNK> introduced by an american ship under control there follows a colorful <UNK> to the capital bearing gifts for the <UNK> including a bottle of old <UNK> the meeting with the <UNK> the <UNK> among the japanese <UNK> and an assassination during an <UNK> exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size
<START> to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that who wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyond beautiful movie that's your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a <UNK> guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own <UNK> in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a <UNK> but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made <UNK> of money in every <UNK> country on the planet and is the top <UNK> film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay <UNK> time to crawl back under your rock i am done
<START> this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie admittedly i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie for being low budget the special effects weren't bad either the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish br br now on to the cons there is very little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development it's hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters when there was a little talking the f bomb was <UNK> popping up in random places yes i understand people swear but it seems like a <UNK> boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language the storyline what i could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left <UNK> and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening br br in the end cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn't work too well rent it though if you're a morbid person looking to <UNK> your blood and flesh <UNK>
<START> me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs s i c k is one of the better horror but funny movie we've rented the plot is over done the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old the <UNK> part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little <UNK> and with blood on the play <UNK> looking meat and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life it's pathetic the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry i don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos i don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's <UNK> i would recommend it br br if your renting buying it to laugh at it i'd give it an 8 5
<START> this movie has no plot no character development and no budget it really sucks to put it in short terms since there is no development for the movie it really can't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak well it falls short here too the girl's reactions just seem dumb it's extremely easy to tell that it's fake honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie they throw <UNK> on her but she's asleep for most of it so it's just kinda dumb the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the <UNK> goes into her eye but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture go watch hostel and hostel 2 not only do they both contain realistic violence but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people plus the <UNK> movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of <UNK> issues of morality testing how far a person can go human instincts vs civilization and many other things plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence these are much better choices over this piece of crap
<START> impressed this is the worst <UNK> movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw i didn't like the novel but this movie made it worse very bad music even worse actors apart from <UNK> of course though even he doesn't manage to save the movie and not much sense the director makes it all look very confusing god knows why maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very <UNK> and yet credible well he manages neither br br even if you've got a few hours to loose don't watch this movie please saying this for your own <UNK> keep searching you will find something else to watch
<START> well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid 10 parking two times because the newspaper <UNK> were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time i've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas <UNK> t have to be saved and that santa didn't need a <UNK> but nope the only cool part was the <UNK> rides and the little <UNK> kid was the best character i'm sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through
<START> this is one <UNK> film it has no real plot we never are made <UNK> to motivations other than wealth the characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film the threat seems to be supernatural but then it's being controlled by these three older people why are they doing what they are doing in order to strike fear into other members of the group i don't know there is some <UNK> from a fog machine that rolls around in the <UNK> and everyone seems to be scared of it does it do something i don't know there's some nudity for its own sake i'm always surprised to see this in films this old things have actually settled down in this regard these days anyway the people run around like <UNK> ready for the <UNK> they have no plan no resources no nothing there are about five silly <UNK> in the film who are these people and is there a ghost or demon what happened to the other people i challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence what a mess
<START> corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns <UNK> or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian <UNK> is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 <UNK> this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to <UNK> its <UNK> system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 2 10 but that's only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in <UNK> i think i'm gonna dislike him
<START> this the finest achievement from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> social realism period is based upon a tragedy in early <UNK> that claimed the lives of nearly <UNK> french <UNK> as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at <UNK> in northern france took place after a fire had <UNK> for three weeks eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the <UNK> <UNK> designer <UNK> <UNK> creates stark sets that <UNK> the tragedy providing a perception of reality <UNK> by <UNK> sound editing with the only music being produced by integral <UNK> during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which <UNK> effects possess equal importance with the <UNK> director's fascinating visual compositions <UNK> manner of invisible editing that <UNK> action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography <UNK> cameras <UNK> upon vehicles <UNK> the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting although the <UNK> <UNK> theme relates to <UNK> dogma the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details born of <UNK> <UNK> skill at <UNK> numerous plot lines into a cinema <UNK> that <UNK> one to admiration for german rescue <UNK> of whom their <UNK> is greatly proud while no less <UNK> of disastrous <UNK> to the families of french victims certainly a <UNK> triumph fully as stimulating today to a <UNK> as it was at the time of its first release
<START> this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old <UNK> of british television denis <UNK> james <UNK> and <UNK> armstrong as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the <UNK> of younger career focused amanda <UNK> the three quirky <UNK> old cops make a brilliant team <UNK> twenty year old <UNK> methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers the three are portrayed <UNK> <UNK> and all there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their <UNK> br br at the end of the first six part series we are promised a further series next year each of the characters had developed widower james <UNK> cannot come to terms with his wife's <UNK> death <UNK> denis <UNK> is learning to accept his role as grandfather and even obsessive <UNK> armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past and keep taking the <UNK> while amanda <UNK> has to face the all too familiar conflict between having a life and a career the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily <UNK> on the wonders of <UNK> testing but it is the interplay of four of <UNK> finest actors which has made the series <UNK>
<START> rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in <UNK> <UNK> women find that their jewish husbands have been locked up <UNK> <UNK> one an aristocrat <UNK> by her family lena <UNK> finds herself among the mob as does general <UNK> sister but rank and <UNK> merit no special consideration br br nor does service to the <UNK> as a female <UNK> whose husband is on the <UNK> will learn in one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband br br <UNK> you think this is typical german <UNK> we in america today have lady bush <UNK> <UNK> the arrest of gold star mothers mothers of us service members killed in action because their very presence is <UNK> little <UNK> has changed in the 60 years from der <UNK> to der <UNK> br br fortunately the eight year old daughter ruth escapes capture br br waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena <UNK> is at first reluctant to take in ruth <UNK> in a way that we take as typically german even lena <UNK> brother colonel arthur von <UNK> who is aware of and opposed to the <UNK> <UNK> lena against it but lena chooses to embrace the idea with an american <UNK> even <UNK> ruth the more <UNK> sounding name <UNK> <UNK> br br the siege ends <UNK> on rosenstrasse but lena <UNK> what happened to ruth after the war years later <UNK> daughter hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old lena under the <UNK> of writing a personal history of the war br br i did <UNK> it interesting that hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the <UNK>
<START> those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as <UNK> <UNK> or a professional <UNK> would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire ustinov stars as a convicted <UNK> we first see him during his last day in <UNK> where he is preparing the prison <UNK> tax return who <UNK> that the future is in computers poses by means of a <UNK> piece of identity <UNK> as a computer expert and sets out to <UNK> an american <UNK> br br ustinov who co wrote the script is on top form as is the delightful maggie smith here unusually cast as an accident prone cockney <UNK> <UNK> bird bob <UNK> also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith in addition karl malden is <UNK> sleazy as ustinov and <UNK> <UNK> boss br br what do i particularly like about this film not only is it a well thought out <UNK> <UNK> but it's also a touching little love story ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two <UNK> stumbling into love the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective br br so what is there not to like well the script is no more computer <UNK> than most films that is hardly at all even though it captures the feel of late '60s <UNK> <UNK> business <UNK> quite well also there are a couple of small plot <UNK> that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing but i consider these to be minor <UNK> br br as i said this is a film which is well worth seeking out and after you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular <UNK> br br
<START> this is not a film you can really <UNK> <UNK> from it's production the audience became the film makers to an extent <UNK> in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend how is it possible to be objective this is our movie isn't it or is it there may be nothing more <UNK> than a film maker who <UNK> himself as the audience's friend giving them all the naughty treats that the <UNK> critics would deny them just look at that prime self <UNK> eli roth promising gore <UNK> all the <UNK> missing from literally <UNK> mainstream horror films only to <UNK> out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like <UNK> br br david r <UNK> may not have <UNK> the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it he took the carnival <UNK> school of film making to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy so many have <UNK> over this <UNK> <UNK> approach to film making that they seem to have missed the point that this is the most cynical form of film as marketing nothing is included that the film makers know the fans won't buy and any old suggestion that will get <UNK> on seats is <UNK> the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know br br isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane <UNK> of the masses it's a critical <UNK> that focus groups and test <UNK> don't make for good movies why should the <UNK> <UNK> of internet <UNK> be any different because we happen to be film fans well thank god for us because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her <UNK> bitten by a snake br br so yes i had fun at the movie a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice cream but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere like christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what there was laughter but i don't know if it was with the film or at the film with a film as <UNK> as this one is that even a meaningful distinction there are some genuinely good aspects to the film samuel l jackson gives a well judged performance pure self parody but with a real sense of pleasure rachel <UNK> and lin <UNK> are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to <UNK> br br the stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isn't what's the point of a film that combines two great <UNK> if there's no <UNK> menace there are several snake jumps out moments but they're incredibly badly staged only the annoying british man gets a decent <UNK> death scene the other killings are oddly flat the demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is <UNK> <UNK> most of the actors fail to make an impression it's a shame that a charismatic actress like <UNK> <UNK> should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the <UNK> flight is a roller coaster she could be talking to the audience the film falls far short br br there are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with <UNK> <UNK> and it's as apt a contrast as any i can think of that film worked so <UNK> because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasn't <UNK> by <UNK> that the characters had a little depth and <UNK> was an unexpected bonus i don't need a post pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film br br this film will in time fade to become a mere <UNK> in film history if it sets a <UNK> however i'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time in all <UNK> nothing much will come of it <UNK> popcorn favourites <UNK> of the lost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and of course <UNK> <UNK> just aren't produced by group think br br in the mean time i'll tell you what i haven't half got a <UNK> for some <UNK> bergman
<START> the potential was there i saw creep and thought <UNK> this is getting <UNK> several times yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored like they never happened the lead character was irritating throughout the movie and at one point my <UNK> and i both <UNK> that we wanted her to die there are some genuinely spooky scary moments but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me it's another one of those horror movies that <UNK> up and <UNK> you for a while but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve br br the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser
<START> that's my bush is a live action project made by south park creators <UNK> parker and matt stone the show was cancelled after one season not because of bad reviews it actually got good reviews but because it was very expensive that's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom it is also a political satire now this is nowhere near as good as south park but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire the guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him if you can find the show check it out there are plenty of laughs to be had br br 9 10
<START> <UNK> by mr <UNK> is an awesome movie its definitely the <UNK> and finest of 2003 there are very good performances in it <UNK> knows what he can <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> she is like u have never seen before one true great performance along with her is a fine actor <UNK> <UNK> who has shown bollywood what he is with <UNK> <UNK> the movie is about a girl <UNK> living in pre <UNK> <UNK> she is from a <UNK> family <UNK> in a small town she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going on for years kinda fight with the <UNK> family and then follows a series of twists and turns as <UNK> arranged marriage is due in few days this movie is truly a very good movie the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay all the performances like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> u wont <UNK> but she can act as well besides <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and many more those sets with pre <UNK> <UNK> costumes cinematography sound background score add to the positive points from the start till the end u r stuck to <UNK> seat with the question whats next this movie is not <UNK> worth <UNK> but deserved to be a part of your movie collection the ultimate scene is the end of the movie i would suggest all those no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and no <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> crowd to watch this amazing flick my rating 10 10
<START> i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released prince doesn't <UNK> us with his phenomenal acting style or anything he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here he's just the best one to tell this story through influence most of this movie is straightforward and <UNK> but that is the directors writers fault still it is a great movie with even better music the principals and moral <UNK> in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the <UNK> we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art
<START> william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but it's also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branagh's hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hours br br we all know the story of the prince of <UNK> and his plot to avenge his father's death so i won't go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors' interpretations of each character i doubt you'll find a better <UNK> than richard <UNK> delicious portrayal plus you can't go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek <UNK> a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet br br of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he <UNK> audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he <UNK> himself with hamlet sure <UNK> presence was captivating but i think branagh's performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen it's almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasn't nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the <UNK> best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you don't really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once but you'll soon find out that <UNK> this movie will make you want to see it even more
<START> having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasn't that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy <UNK> legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> boss <UNK> was too <UNK> to be evil and <UNK> was just hyper throughout every screen moment it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series br br back to the movie if you watch this film in it's own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then it's not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d o h is all about johnny <UNK> is his usual eccentric self and along with <UNK> william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb and dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a <UNK> as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss <UNK> and m c <UNK> makes a <UNK> nasty <UNK> p <UNK> the way he always should have been br br if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs that's not too <UNK> on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind
<START> forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes they only look 12 year <UNK> to please the wide audience of <UNK> that want to be their heroes since they cannot be rambo or <UNK> or even indiana jones hollywood allowed a bunch of <UNK> that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick br br however their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their <UNK> without question this explains the <UNK> of <UNK> on our silver screens over the past few years for better rocky rambo or worse die hard 4 where john <UNK> <UNK> yourselves had no beard br br i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end this <UNK> <UNK> movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times but at least <UNK> <UNK> delivered a very promising performance as an action hero and the only one time where he was <UNK> is when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his beard i rest my case br br i didn't know it when i entered the theater room but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade for the first time in france since <UNK> can a movie be both well crafted and <UNK> in b genre without <UNK> over its performance in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too <UNK> to reach a wider audience in other words it was le <UNK> des <UNK> or <UNK> i like <UNK> mind you i believe <UNK> <UNK> has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making br br i <UNK> the theater room very pleased and hungry for more
<START> offbeat slow paced entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and <UNK> scenes that will undoubtedly <UNK> some viewers however it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains or to ignore <UNK> first rate performance verhoeven maintains an intriguing <UNK> throughout the film playing with the meaning of the hero's visions <UNK> unfortunately in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a <UNK> and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie
<START> i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is wonderfully thought up and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show br br it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as <UNK> and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity br br with a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode pushing daisies is by far one of the most remarkable shows on your television
<START> yes commitment let's say fever pitch might trick you into believing it's a baseball movie br br but no you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the <UNK> brothers but of course if you are one you will enjoy it even more with all the references pretty accurate ones i'd say to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history from the curse of the <UNK> and everything attributed to it including those two words you cannot <UNK> in front of a boston fan bill <UNK> br br drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship the successful <UNK> who is also <UNK> meeting a school teacher thing is <UNK> character wins <UNK> heart by being funny caring sweet and downright perfect but her friends ask her a logical question if he's such a keeper why is he still on the market enter the boston red sox he's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him he has never missed a red sox home game at <UNK> park in a long while br br and that delicate balance how much is the <UNK> willing to give up for his guy's obsession and how much is that baseball crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life is what this movie is all about br br at first you might think that the sports obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief well i'm sad to admit they are not myself as a die hard <UNK> <UNK> fan can say they are all true i would try at every way available to see every <UNK> game listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet i read the <UNK> sports section every day and yes my room looks like the shed minute maid <UNK> gift shop with a closet full of <UNK> gear including 5 <UNK> 20 t shirts and you know the rest <UNK> character even has the red sox <UNK> <UNK> br br fallon was credible enough as the <UNK> red sox faithful even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon thank god adam sandler wasn't in it and the plot <UNK> around how this couple tried to manage with each other's passions br br i'd say it'll be a classical romantic comedy not enough to be among the best movies in history but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike
<START> if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best it is good enough as most of them are but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point the situation is unusually intriguing the <UNK> in the <UNK> have two <UNK> a <UNK> boss for once and a <UNK> samurai who starts a sort of <UNK> both run <UNK> of the usual local gangsters who want the <UNK> to fail because it <UNK> their gambling <UNK> and their chances to snap up some land their chief or powerful ally is a seeming <UNK> who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly <UNK> his own perverse <UNK> he also resembles dracula as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally but by now he has lost many of his nuances and the changes in some of the characters such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed need more time then the movie has to give so that the story seems choppy as if some scenes were missing other than that the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series good acting sometimes lyrical photography the creation of a vivid believable and uniquely recognizable landscape the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it and a technical quality that of its nature <UNK> itself the <UNK> varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist and of course there is the <UNK> actor whose presence as much as his performance makes it all work this must be one of the best <UNK> series in movie history
<START> this stirring western <UNK> the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was <UNK> by one and all james stewart is the cowboy who wins the <UNK> winchester in a shootout only to lose it in a robbery the story details stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film the rifle changes hands time after time as though the owner is <UNK> to lose it through violence the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart <UNK> in on his <UNK> a great cast supports stewart here namely stephen <UNK> dan duryea <UNK> mitchell john mcintire and jay c <UNK> shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure tony curtis and rock hudson teen <UNK> in later years have brief but good roles
<START> this movie shows how savage the troubles really are people who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered this movie shows how the people of northern ireland both catholic and <UNK> are held captive at any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not
<START> 1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in hollywood history with more classic films released than in any other and john ford directed three of the best <UNK> drums along the <UNK> and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the union young mr lincoln br br with the world <UNK> into a war that america <UNK> but knew it would be drawn into abraham lincoln was much on people's minds in 1939 as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life and had <UNK> on broadway robert e <UNK> award winning <UNK> lincoln in <UNK> with raymond <UNK> physically dead on portrayal was playing to packed houses it would be filmed in 1940 carl <UNK> <UNK> of his epic biography abraham lincoln the war years was published and quickly became a best <UNK> president <UNK> frequently referred to lincoln in speeches and the lincoln <UNK> in washington d c became the most popular landmark in town a fact that frank <UNK> made good use of in mr smith goes to washington br br all this was not lost on <UNK> f <UNK> at 20th century fox as soon as he read <UNK> <UNK> screenplay of <UNK> early days as a lawyer he <UNK> it a <UNK> production and assigned john ford to direct and henry fonda to star br br fonda did not want to play lincoln he felt he couldn't do justice to the <UNK> <UNK> and feared a bad performance would damage his career even a filmed make up test in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble lincoln wouldn't change his mind according to fonda john ford whom he'd never worked with <UNK> him out <UNK> at their first meeting and explained he wasn't portraying the lincoln of legend but a young <UNK> country lawyer facing his first murder trial <UNK> fonda took the role john ford offered a different scenario of the events but the outcome was the same obviously they found a chemistry together that worked as nearly all of their <UNK> would produce <UNK> br br unlike the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lincoln of <UNK> lincoln in <UNK> ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney who made friends easily and misses the mother he lost too young resulting in a bond with a <UNK> mother that becomes a vital part of the story injustice <UNK> him and he speaks <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> violence <UNK> with doses of humor both productions play on <UNK> <UNK> relationship with ann <UNK> in ford's version the pair are truly in love and committed to each other after her death lincoln would frequently visit her grave to share his life with her <UNK> a theme ford would continue in she wore a yellow <UNK> br br a murder trial is the <UNK> of the film and shows the <UNK> talents of the star and director fonda <UNK> portrays <UNK> <UNK> yet earnest belief in justice <UNK> with mercy and ford <UNK> the <UNK> between the big city <UNK> represented by pompous d a donald meek and his slick <UNK> stephen douglas played by a young <UNK> stone and the <UNK> rule <UNK> country sense of lincoln with ford <UNK> ward bond as a key witness the trial is both unconventional and riveting br br with the film closing as lincoln <UNK> away into the <UNK> distance and his destiny <UNK> into a view of the statue at the lincoln <UNK> audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just good would ultimately triumph br br young mr lincoln is a truly remarkable film from an amazing year
<START> the fallen ones starts with <UNK> matt <UNK> casper van <UNK> in the desert discovering the <UNK> remains of a <UNK> foot tall giant now there's something you don't see everyday matt is working for property <UNK> <UNK> robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land he calls in fellow <UNK> angela <UNK> miller for reasons i'm unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing <UNK> calls in security guy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to handle the situation meanwhile ancient text <UNK> the <UNK> eli <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> some ancient text as he would is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up take over the world for the fallen one or something like that it's up to matt to save the day the whole planet br br written directed by kevin <UNK> who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film it's as simple straight forward as that there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical <UNK> level the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live the character's are awful as clich√©d as you like the dialogue is bad as in very very bad the entire film is predictable i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van <UNK> is going to save the day is it it's not a huge surprise that the <UNK> giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of <UNK> state this is bad very bad you have been warned br br director <UNK> doesn't impress the fight scenes are absolutely awful why dress your bad guys up in a horrible <UNK> of purple they look <UNK> to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour there are also some normal sized <UNK> that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy 1999 unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect in fact are wasted as some comic relief the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is forget about any scares tension or atmosphere don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any br br technically the fallen ones isn't anything special apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about the ghost cgi water effects are terrible it was made for tv it's shows the acting was poor wagner looks embarrassed this is probably the only thing the likes of <UNK> <UNK> can get these days br br the fallen ones is a bad film there's no two ways about it as far as i'm concerned not recommended on any level or in any way one to avoid
<START> shame shame shame on <UNK> <UNK> for what you do br br i was appalled br br do not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed certainly we all have read <UNK> wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations but this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his thumbs up at such a <UNK> attempt to capitalize on a classic br br what a pity br br spend your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and <UNK> it to a toys for <UNK> program this movie is not worth a free ticket viewing br br stick with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money seriously save your money it will be on cable by saint <UNK> day br br shame shame shame on what they do
<START> this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely family type entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid western town of big bean <UNK> where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement pre invasion of the decade is the new and only exit <UNK> from the <UNK> the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being well <UNK> with an <UNK> of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on <UNK> the martians too the martians dead pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween <UNK> duck has just great lines watch this movie for <UNK> and entertainment thought provoking it isn't but subtle and enjoyable it is
<START> red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy <UNK> wes craven wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa after attending the funeral of her grandmother she decides to take the red eye flight during waiting she meets this man named jack <UNK> how <UNK> is that and they sort of become friends ironically both sit right next to each other on this plane then this is when the horror starts this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling horror films well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production wes craven did well with this film he chose the right actors like rachel mcadams an intelligent sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is <UNK> of everything when she's acting in a film cillian murphy the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film and his face can really <UNK> your eyes wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one
<START> if you like animal movies this movie will please my wife likes animals and animal movies she especially like the parrot in this film it is <UNK> towards kids but i laughed at most of the humor the french fashion character made me laugh and adds balance to the script it is a disney film with its sappy happily family <UNK> but i like leaving the theater with a positive <UNK>
<START> really a terrible movie it's to be expected though clearly a low budget nothing all that innovative an actress if you can call what she does acting who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene a man in a <UNK> suit almost <UNK> after predator a cabin in the woods etc but there are some redeeming points although the story is not new for the most part there's a few parts that aren't so <UNK> for one the black guy doesn't die when he's attacked the first time and he isn't even one of the first couple to die but that's minor more importantly there's a very interesting twist regarding <UNK> experiments and wes steve that i didn't see coming when steve told <UNK> he knew what she did i believed what he said and what <UNK> <UNK> with but when the creature revealed who he really was i was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation it could be because of my lack of experience with the genre or that it's a genuinely clever twist br br either way the movie's pretty bad and don't watch it if there's anything better on unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick
<START> your attitude going into prom night ii will determine how much joy you take away from the film if you're expecting a horror masterpiece look elsewhere if you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold you'll like this lisa <UNK> has the time of her life playing an over the top mary lou and wendy <UNK> channels <UNK> rage perfectly during her time possessed br br not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending br br
<START> white fire has so much going for it with larry bird look alike robert <UNK> leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache the movie <UNK> above other low budget <UNK> the charisma he has in this makes tom <UNK> look like a <UNK> with <UNK> beating up everyone the movie only rises in <UNK> when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play then add in fred <UNK> some frontal bush chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes this flick ends up delivering on all <UNK> if you're looking for some awesome b action this is where it's at now if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack
<START> the sword fighting was out of this world the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques until the end that are way too common today the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were clich√© but the movie is comfortable with it an <UNK> of humour from woo br br the plot with it's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on br br a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises the depth of the story is quite intense for a <UNK> film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung fu flicks don't
<START> the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it <UNK> back and forth between vignettes of <UNK> story and re creations of the <UNK> short films while the <UNK> re creations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stage y but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
<START> dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film the way it is shot lit acted etc just doesn't make sense it's all so bad it is difficult to watch loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom there seems to be no <UNK> person in the entire film and the existence of the <UNK> <UNK> is well it just doesn't exist and why does that bald guy become <UNK> all of a sudden this film is beyond stupidity zero
<START> alien love as this movie is known in britain is a very strange movie i don t mean that it s an <UNK> art house movie in the style of peter <UNK> or derek <UNK> i mean it s a <UNK> with swearing sex some really good t a a bad script and a very retro feel you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier though of course he would have cut out the t a br br going back to the bad script one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda why does she pick up connie at the bar just so she could meet an alien do you see what i mean about retro et short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here the storyline continues to follow an ill defined unconvincing and illogical path br br that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the t a on display as a a sci fi sex comedy it s much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
<START> i had the <UNK> of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie there's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king 1 1 2 except its different stories all told by the mice the reason i'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
<START> last of the johnny <UNK> tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years no <UNK> are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the <UNK> of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride she finds tarzan and jane who try to protect her george <UNK> is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn't used to his full advantage also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often even the great robert <UNK> can't aid this one br br 1 2 of four
<START> this is easily the worst <UNK> vehicle ever which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made it is <UNK> worse than even the revolting happy ending song at the end of it happened at the world's fair and here i thought that moment when elvis buys all of the <UNK> <UNK> for his girl and then the balloon <UNK> gets <UNK> to the <UNK> band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped i usually enjoy the random elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it this one however ought to be called live a little wish you were dead a little and makes stay away joe look like olivier playing othello br br here elvis plays greg who is essentially a hippie free lance photographer except for the establishment <UNK> after a fun morning of reckless driving he ends up at the beach where he is <UNK> by a woman who's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her clearly <UNK> carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to <UNK> elizabeth taylor if i watched this without my glasses i would have thought it was late 1960's liz playing the female lead she <UNK> her dog on elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie <UNK> then she keeps him <UNK> up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he <UNK> without even telling him the audience does not know about it either until elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house br br rather than having her arrested for kidnapping <UNK> and assault he goes out and gets two jobs to <UNK> the back rent miss crazy pants had to spring for when stealing all of his <UNK> job one is working for don porter at a playboy type magazine job two is upstairs working for <UNK> <UNK> at a <UNK> fashion magazine i think the two job <UNK> is supposed to be the comedy too bad it isn't the least bit funny unless you'd laugh the <UNK> time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast motion to silly music the <UNK> <UNK> that keeps greg from falling for his <UNK> is her other love interest the dreadfully miscast dick <UNK> let's face it either porter or <UNK> even given their advanced ages in 1968 would have made far more believable <UNK> for miss <UNK> affections br br there are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns i kept waiting for something anything to happen that would make all of this make sense it never did entertainment <UNK> approximately three minutes and is comprised of <UNK> rendition of a little less talk which i can listen to on cd without this painful movie inflicted upon me and a funny five second bit where elvis <UNK> on the couch and crazy pants has apparently <UNK> it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it that's it folks <UNK> furniture the only laugh in this entire film no amount of <UNK> sixties clothing music or <UNK> can salvage this high heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self <UNK> of grave <UNK> harm
<START> far from providing the <UNK> kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy <UNK> of warm <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about and never really rises above being just a <UNK> revenge tale indeed if the movie was a cup of coffee it'd be rather weak and <UNK> <UNK> with a few <UNK> <UNK> and lacking in a lingering <UNK> <UNK> it hits the spot but otherwise it isn't the hot action drama it hopes to be br br plot wise <UNK> is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug pushing lady <UNK> mob <UNK> that hooked her younger sister into a <UNK> sick state <UNK> political commentary on the plight of urban black <UNK> in america is prominent in <UNK> and it makes for some thought provoking stuff as <UNK> <UNK> against the political corruption and white establishment racism that <UNK> and acts as a <UNK> off the targeted <UNK> american <UNK> sadly the <UNK> messages are <UNK> by the film's poor quality and lack of focus <UNK> ideas are important it's just that they are not well aimed br br one of the plus points of <UNK> is the presence of <UNK> icon pam <UNK> <UNK> goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she <UNK> down the <UNK> in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence how do you deal with a house full of <UNK> drive the car right through the front door it's just a shame that the storyline <UNK> on occasions wasting time <UNK> as much sexual exploitation as possible the low budget can't have helped but neither does the fact that for a <UNK> flick <UNK> lacks groove just as the issues are <UNK> by the lack of quality consequently the entertainment and excitement are also <UNK> by moments of <UNK> and <UNK> br br the total result is <UNK> and wooden we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie it's a shame as <UNK> has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the <UNK> <UNK> it just never <UNK> above being an average <UNK> number
<START> it was a good story but not very well told i liked the themes and the main story line which wasn't as clear as it could have been maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in the acting was okay to cheesy some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad i only just finished watching it and i'm glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end again a good story but the delivery was sub par would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy and i do mean a little
<START> what can one say about a film that has one of the <UNK> most <UNK> and occasionally most <UNK> i wont say <UNK> i will say <UNK> villains in the history of the cinema and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their <UNK> this is an epic about a stubborn sometimes foolish incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against <UNK> i loved it john hurt and tim roth were great villains jessica lange was very moving tender and sensual
<START> absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on this was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their <UNK> on boring boring boring each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way no acting talent shown just reading a part alec can play realistic characters normally <UNK> made herself look ugly for an <UNK> part <UNK> needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be <UNK> in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment running with <UNK> leads the public to <UNK> great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion there was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen maybe it was the director's fault whatever
<START> that 70s show is the best tv show ever period it's up there with the andy <UNK> show saturday night live and the simpsons in my book that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons all of which focus around a group of teenagers young adults dealing with relationships <UNK> from their parents and their overall <UNK> br br the two main characters eric and donna are two teenagers living next door to each other they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working br br two other characters red and kitty are <UNK> parents red was in the service so he really pushes eric around kitty is just the opposite even though she drinks heavily she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care bob their neighbor is obviously <UNK> dad bob <UNK> around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story bob also <UNK> red to his full extent br br the remaining character hyde <UNK> <UNK> and jackie are <UNK> friends they also play a major role in the show's story br br well the first season is great this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other the first season is original funny and enjoyable br br the second season is good although it isn't as good as the first it is a basic <UNK> of the first eric and donna are together and everything is working out great br br the third season is my favorite it went back and captured the first season feel and humor i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch making the show all that more fun to watch br br the fourth season isn't near as good eric and donna <UNK> together in this one making the show slightly less <UNK> it is still funny although i didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons br br the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through it is the <UNK> senior year so that really helps with the story the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons br br the sixth season is good for the most part it is extremely funny although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did the gang is out of high school so i believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did i also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them br br the seventh season captures the same feel that the <UNK> season had in a way although it didn't do it all the way i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others and the ending is great br br the last season flat out sucked eric wasn't in it which ruined it <UNK> wasn't in it for the most part either which didn't help i hated the <UNK> season up until the last episode i thought that the last episode was really good and a fitting ending to the series br br so overall if you enjoy comedy give that 70s show a try they stopped making new episodes but it is still on tv a bunch i also recommend buying seasons 1 7 it is up to you if you want to buy season 8
<START> this is the first time i'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb but i had to write it for this one its 3 <UNK> of <UNK> torture from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad the acting is pathetic i'm a big fan of ajay <UNK> loved him in <UNK> <UNK> but he is at his worst in this movie amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one but somehow the fear is missing <UNK> raj is a non actor and the most irritating part of the movie is <UNK> <UNK> i have no clue why the director took her in this movie the background score is repetitive somehow i felt that <UNK> tried to repeat a <UNK> the color theme the background score the camera angles but it didn't work please don't watch it
<START> initially i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion and here being christianity and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the <UNK> of blind faith or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly <UNK> than <UNK> surprisingly it was none of the sort and was largely non <UNK> putting in place events as a matter of fact and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion br br and i can't help but to chuckle at the role of song <UNK> ho a man who's taken a liking for widower shin <UNK> <UNK> do <UNK> and starts going to church when she does the reasons for church going are many i suppose either to find inner peace to seek help being afraid of eternal <UNK> in the fires of hell to <UNK> faith or even things like wanting to get married in a church or to <UNK> chase i kid you not but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and <UNK> in <UNK> groups for <UNK> what is indeed dangerous is when the underlying <UNK> motives do not get satisfied and that's when frustration sets in or when you discover how <UNK> man can be portraying one face inside the house of god and displaying yet another outside br br shin <UNK> and her son <UNK> moves to the town of <UNK> which is the <UNK> of her deceased husband wanting to start life <UNK> she opens up a piano shop to give lessons though in discovering her new found freedom and in a <UNK> lack of good judgement has another tragedy <UNK> her and that takes one hour to get to secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shin <UNK> now taking to <UNK> religion to deal with and accept her current state <UNK> in the comfort that religion and fellow <UNK> can offer br br what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the <UNK> of all mankind and sometimes you wonder if it's because of your personal <UNK> view of what the almighty is doing for you that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that <UNK> good going your way and in shin <UNK> case her <UNK> attitude in wanting to forgive others who had <UNK> against her forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too br br the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty where most of us can identify with why me and why not someone else as we rage against our faith and start questioning unfortunately with no hard and fast answers available it is then either we fall by the <UNK> or continue with destructive deeds so <UNK> but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend and what could have been an ugly character <UNK> got muted br br if you bite into the hype this movie is <UNK> then perhaps you'll realize only <UNK> do <UNK> excellent portrayal is worth mentioning as she totally owns her role as the widow shin <UNK> who is probably the most <UNK> person on earth in having to deal with that many <UNK> over a short period of time and if you look at it carefully most of which are of her own doing watching her transformation is worth the ticket price and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song <UNK> ho in the movie this is something he just <UNK> right through

<START> oh what a condescending movie set in los angeles the center of the universe from the <UNK> of hollywood filmmakers this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst br br stereotyped smarmy characters of widely varying <UNK> economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday <UNK> lives the plot is disjointed and <UNK> numerous unimaginative plot <UNK> keep the film going like a drive by shooting an abandoned baby left in the <UNK> a gang of thugs <UNK> a lawyer a guy flying through the night sky over the city a kid at summer camp br br and through all these events the one constant is the generous helping of <UNK> insights <UNK> through the dialogue as characters compare notes on their life experiences one character tells another when you sit on the edge of that thing the grand canyon you realize what a joke we people are those rocks are laughing at me i could tell me and my <UNK> it's real humorous to that grand canyon br br and another character <UNK> about the meaning of it all there's a <UNK> in this country an ever <UNK> <UNK> between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground as big as the grand canyon and what's come <UNK> out is an <UNK> of rage and the rage creates violence br br aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue aside from the shallow smarmy characters aside from the dumb plot the story's pace is <UNK> slow acting is uninspired and <UNK> the film's tone is smug and self satisfied in the <UNK> contempt for viewers br br this was a film project <UNK> by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as <UNK> <UNK> looking down from on high they think their film will be a startling revelation to us <UNK> <UNK> movie goers eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change
<START> the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex <UNK> who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other br br the comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the <UNK> little trivial things the material is fast paced and witty appealing to all ages br br mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal <UNK> with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere <UNK> that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each other br br if anyone loves the odd couple you'll adore this movie an excellent film
<START> this movie was horrible i swear they didn't even write a script they just kinda <UNK> it through out the whole movie ice t was annoying as hell spoilers <UNK> more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he <UNK> been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when ice t is on that hill and uses that <UNK> 15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight <UNK> it would take <UNK> of <UNK> to cut down a tree that size <UNK> and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at <UNK> and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didn't see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of <UNK> to death right there <UNK> ending where he <UNK> a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldn't blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
<START> saw this on tv i'm glad i didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental the movie is totally predictable from the corrupt owner and <UNK> to the <UNK> electric <UNK> the plot is really weak and unbelievable the <UNK> expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking <UNK> using actual footage and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down the <UNK> <UNK> down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road br br some of the actual <UNK> material is impressive and shows its devastating power but the contract between the real <UNK> and the staged stuff makes this film look even <UNK> br br do yourself a favour don't bother with this one not even on t v
<START> a <UNK> remembered melodrama ¬ñ thanks <UNK> to ronald <UNK> fine oscar winning central performance ¬ñ about an <UNK> treated theme the nature of acting and how it can <UNK> one's perception of reality in this case we have a well known <UNK> <UNK> shakespeare's othello so that the film's last third <UNK> effectively into the thriller genre ¬ñ with press agent <UNK> o'brien who happens to really be <UNK> with <UNK> co star and ex wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the actor's possible involvement in the <UNK> like <UNK> of a celebrity seeking waitress a very slim shelley winters the theatrical new york atmosphere of the immediate post war era is vividly captured by the husband and wife screen writing team of <UNK> <UNK> and ruth gordon and legendary actor's director george <UNK> all of whom were recognized by the academy with nominations incidentally the film <UNK> a second oscar for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score colman forever the suave leading man blessed besides with a <UNK> voice does well enough by shakespeare ¬ñ gaining conviction the <UNK> his character slips into obsessive jealousy a murderous rage and eventually paranoia however he is not let down by a supporting cast which also includes director ray collins reporter <UNK> mitchell detective joe <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> though the mid section is a bit strained the film makes up for any <UNK> with a remarkably handled <UNK> denouement
<START> i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was <UNK> at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br i don't remember much of the plot and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to it's <UNK> potential the <UNK> are fantastic and the hotel is <UNK> on a <UNK> at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i'm using that term <UNK> scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
<START> the <UNK> trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a q a session with director <UNK> harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of <UNK> website this movie has to be seen to be believed i sincerely recommend searching for <UNK> name on the web and then buying the film from his site he's an incredibly nice guy to boot don't get confused the cameraman in the fictional sections of the <UNK> trilogy is not <UNK> br br after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version it's like a try out version for the <UNK> glover <UNK> kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the <UNK> of a big star in this gritty b w video br br this is probably also one of <UNK> <UNK> best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original <UNK> gary once you see this film you'll never get <UNK> nervous laughter out of your head ever again
<START> i love <UNK> dunst especially in <UNK> i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in <UNK> in this movie however she did try to add in more artificial performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a sober editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way therefore her performance is not enduring in this film br br the film on the whole is <UNK> and inspiring the character of young is full and reasonable anyway the film tells a big and sophisticated story br br the only big <UNK> is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and <UNK> love story i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because that is rather unclear for the two persons
<START> in this sequel to the 1989 action comedy classic k 9 detective <UNK> james belushi and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime but this time they are teamed up with another detective christine <UNK> and her partner a mean <UNK> named <UNK> who does not get along with jerry lee very well <UNK> does not get along with his new partner much either that all changes as the movie goes along the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill <UNK> for the way he treated him in the past there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of <UNK> wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences dog <UNK> jokes fart jokes and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area i know that that seems like very low humor but some of it is actually very funny i didn't see this movie for the jokes i saw it for two reasons the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences james belushi is funnier than he was in k 9 and the action sequences at are better too it would have been nice to see more characters from k 9 to return but it's still a fun movie if you are a james belushi fan you'll love this movie
<START> this review is based on the dubbed shock o <UNK> video released on an <UNK> world in 2002 how bad is it it's awful which is what a <UNK> represents on the imdb scale but it's much worse than that it's nice to imagine that an original german language print might improve matters the comedic english language dubbing isn't funny at all but <UNK> this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal however they're also intelligent enough to operate <UNK> and <UNK> enough to know that western <UNK> about <UNK> will no doubt <UNK> their dinner table conversation george romero's land of the dead <UNK> a zombie nation that <UNK> a shred of social <UNK> here zombies are nothing more than an empty <UNK> for the perverse <UNK> of director <UNK> <UNK> utterly without redeeming social value and even worse entirely lacking as entertainment zombie <UNK> is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it
<START> this movie was a confusing piece of garbage you never knew what was going on the characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for gus played masterfully by george <UNK> i hate this movie but compared to others dark <UNK> <UNK> curse it should have won an academy award it was particularly sad to see a talented actor like george <UNK> in such a <UNK> and tacky film lifetime you have <UNK> to whole new low someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary for shame lifetime for shame
<START> spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie <UNK> lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act and his future real life ex kathleen <UNK> is ass kicking hot chick <UNK> <UNK> simpson is a detective <UNK> by on his since <UNK> <UNK> public persona translation cable tv filler there isn't enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure br br the script has some <UNK> holes best worst moment in one jarring scene <UNK> partner expresses his <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague <UNK> reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so <UNK> that i laughed until <UNK> came out of my nose now that's a guilty pleasure <UNK>
<START> this is indeed quite the strange movie first we have an ex u s <UNK> trying to turn actor or something and this seems to be the only role he ever got that i know of anyway and for good reason while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest it is a rather bland and flat performance second we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie i'm not kidding this alone makes the movie extremely comical but in that annoying way <UNK> and third while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast including the required hot chick an actually not so bad story and some cool visuals the dialogue fight scenes involving <UNK> hilarious and overall execution of the plot are weak this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie too bad fox wasn't around in 1985 it's one of those movies that's simply bad yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable
<START> in the lost son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring this film <UNK> all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst case scenario that exists only in the minds of hollywood the press and <UNK> john <UNK> if you get a chance to see this you'd be better off getting lost yourself
<START> what an awful show science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality it shocks me that something exceptional like <UNK> lasts one season while garbage like the battlestar galactica remake <UNK> a spin off this spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show the acting is juvenile and uninspired the characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in a bad sci fi series the story is bad the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera the direction is shoddy and the sets are awful caprica is a waste of film a waste of time and a waste of effort this is one spin off that should have never been made
<START> this movie is now my <UNK> against which all other movies will be compared as in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely <UNK> by 2 hours of sheer nonsense jason <UNK> would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first 10 minutes he's given a <UNK> by andre 3000 and big <UNK> of <UNK> fame which makes no sense at all then there's some shooting and then there's ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini <UNK> then there's some animation ray <UNK> naked butt lots of shooting teeth <UNK> art house wanna be <UNK> and more of <UNK> embarrassing body that <UNK> laughs at every showing which i'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for not 5 times anyway everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he's <UNK> bear <UNK> the story lines might have went nowhere but the <UNK> was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it
<START> panic in the streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director <UNK> kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of <UNK> as a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable an important <UNK> which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which <UNK> the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high level br br following a <UNK> between the participants in a card game a man called <UNK> lewis charles is shot and his body is dumped in the <UNK> area when the body is found and the <UNK> <UNK> the presence of a virus u s public health official dr <UNK> reed richard widmark is called in and his examination <UNK> the presence of <UNK> plague reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be <UNK> without <UNK> because the very <UNK> nature of the disease means that without such action anyone infected could be expected to die within days br br as the identity of the dead man is unknown the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police <UNK> are not fully convinced by <UNK> <UNK> they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken <UNK> the investigation that follows is <UNK> by a lack of <UNK> from the immigrant community a group of <UNK> the <UNK> of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found br br <UNK> an illegal immigrant had been in a gang with <UNK> jack palance raymond <UNK> zero mostel and vince <UNK> tommy cook and when gang leader <UNK> becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation he <UNK> that <UNK> must've <UNK> something very valuable into the country as <UNK> and <UNK> were related <UNK> assumes that <UNK> must know something about this and goes to find out more <UNK> however is very ill and unable to provide any information <UNK> brings in his own doctor and together with <UNK> starts to move <UNK> out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase follows br br richard widmark gives a strong performance as an <UNK> public official who <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic <UNK> as a family man in an unusual type of role for him he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly jack <UNK> film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who <UNK> <UNK> reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation his distinctive looks also help to make his on screen presence even more compelling br br in typical <UNK> noir style <UNK> cinematography and neo <UNK> influences are <UNK> in <UNK> to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place <UNK> kazan directs with <UNK> throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the <UNK>

<START> years ago i was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a gypsy film festival in santa monica you know the ending is not going to be <UNK> and tragedy will strike but it's really about the journey and characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into what was <UNK> while i am not <UNK> and tend to shy away from the current crop of <UNK> films give me <UNK> <UNK> over late 90s <UNK> i'd be happy to have the chance to stumble on this film again as it shines in my celluloid memories ever since seeing who's singing over there 15 years ago i still hear the theme tune sung by the <UNK> <UNK> through my <UNK> i am miserable i was born that <UNK> with the accompanying <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> making the tune both funny and sad the late great actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from when father was away on business was memorable as the bus driver of the ill <UNK> trip in his typical gruff yet <UNK> manner hi
<START> every now and then a movie <UNK> itself as scary or frightening though they usually aren't most modern horror movies fit into this category br br then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and <UNK> to <UNK> through your <UNK> harder than usual they actually <UNK> you to a level that you've never experienced br br halloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe but nearly all of them work halloween is awe inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole br br the story is simple laurie <UNK> jamie lee curtis is <UNK> some kids on halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago of course the madman later known as michael myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after laurie br br sounds familiar right just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and <UNK> of gore not a chance br br i think james <UNK> puts it perfectly in his review of halloween because of its title halloween has frequently been <UNK> together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s however while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member br br he has a point and for a number of reasons first and foremost it's downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore <UNK> one could argue that many recent ones are tongue in cheek but most of those fail as well second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low in fact one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be <UNK> into a single movie each <UNK> and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares and also skill third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they don't do them because they're dumb the characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots we're frightened because they're making a mistake br br one of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real nothing is hard to swallow in this film there's no supernatural there's no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or <UNK> instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us br br horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice it's a hit or miss game which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has which i'm not they'd seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years br br acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be this is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters the actors act like real people not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but it's hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why but the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifying br br this is carpenter's movie through and through he directed it co wrote it co produced it and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance and his later movie the thing supports this statement though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically <UNK> as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is it's not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie it's not that it's bad it's just that there's no good reason to fear the shape luckily carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while there's no <UNK> in this relationship it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters but not so much that it's <UNK> when they die but once the film gets to halloween night that's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end br br while halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you
<START> this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is <UNK> horrible alas while the logic that humans can't stay underwater forever is <UNK> other basic physical logic are ignored it's <UNK> if you don't have cold weather <UNK> if you're in the <UNK> i don't know why most comments here return of <UNK> rates worse i thought this one is more horrible
<START> contains spoilers br br the british director j lee thompson made some excellent films notably <UNK> cold in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> is one of his more curious offerings the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland and details the strange <UNK> relationship between sir charles <UNK> an eccentric <UNK> <UNK> his sister <UNK> and <UNK> estranged husband douglas who is hoping for a <UNK> with her we learn that during his career as an army officer charles was regarded as having <UNK> moral <UNK> this appears to have been an accurate <UNK> of his condition throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy <UNK> with the world and his main sources of emotional support seem to be <UNK> and his <UNK> bottle the film ends with his <UNK> to an upper class lunatic asylum br br peter o'toole was when he was at his best as in <UNK> of <UNK> one of <UNK> leading actors but the quality of his work was very uneven and <UNK> <UNK> is not one of his better films he overacts <UNK> making charles into a caricature of the useless <UNK> aristocrat as though he were <UNK> for a part in the monty python <UNK> class <UNK> of the <UNK> sketch <UNK> york as <UNK> and michael craig as douglas are rather better but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film there is also little in the way of coherent plot beyond the tale of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slide br br the main problem with the film however is neither the acting nor the plot but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name there are half hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and <UNK> or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy unfortunately even in the swinging sixties and early seventies the date of the film is <UNK> given as either 1969 or 1970 there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow and a film with an <UNK> incestuous theme was definitely off limits the american title for the film was <UNK> <UNK> but this was not used in britain was it too suggestive for the liking of the <UNK> these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what <UNK> charles or what has caused his moral collapse resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre 4 10
<START> to be honest this film is another in a series of huge <UNK> most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron <UNK> everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the <UNK> sounded like someone was playing <UNK> it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe <UNK> i don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand
<START> in an otherwise good review <UNK> says the truth is that the americans use a secret <UNK> anti radiation <UNK> it is not that well known and the exact <UNK> are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command <UNK> has long been <UNK> available it uses a lightweight <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these <UNK> are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged <UNK> than lead which is better suited to stopping <UNK> <UNK> like x <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big <UNK> <UNK> but it simply wasn't a serious threat to the apollo <UNK> the command <UNK> gave them pretty good protection during their brief 1 2 hour or so passage through the van allen <UNK> they all carried <UNK> so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1 5 <UNK> and usually much less of the 24 men who flew to the moon 12 of whom landed 18 are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard <UNK> and jack <UNK> bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks <UNK> <UNK> and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good <UNK> for a group of men now in their late 70s shepard would be <UNK>
<START> an <UNK> woman named stella bette midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offers to marry her out of a sense of <UNK> but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own things go ok until the child named jenny <UNK> <UNK> becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worse br br i've seen both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affected me much and i cry easily but they were well made if dated trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of <UNK> to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by today's standards even though midler and <UNK> give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen collins and <UNK> mason both good actors don't help in supporting roles flimsy and dull really who thought this would work see the <UNK> stanwyck version instead i give this a 1
<START> this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to <UNK> the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what it's worth and not as <UNK> alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a <UNK> drunk irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to <UNK> a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur <UNK> but then <UNK> falls for linda a waitress and petty thief br br dudley moore is perfect as arthur the world's most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed <UNK> minnelli <UNK> as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill <UNK> plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur br br however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays <UNK> sarcastic but moral butler <UNK> it's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during <UNK> longtime <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> best friend and <UNK> of <UNK> commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not <UNK> romance at all but his unusual <UNK> with this witty and of course <UNK> <UNK> servant it's the butler you'll remember best long after the closing credits roll
<START> jean <UNK> had not one <UNK> of acting talent like all her films <UNK> <UNK> suffers not at all from her looks though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom tom <UNK> <UNK> accurately describes as boys with breasts <UNK> of course use the word <UNK> but suffers <UNK> from <UNK> dull monotonous killing voice in all her films when had to play anger <UNK> played it with grossly <UNK> distracting <UNK> <UNK> between her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> juvenile fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography but then that's difficult to <UNK> on the <UNK> french <UNK> and perhaps for his apt but certainly not groundbreaking <UNK> of black white for the present day scenes from which <UNK> <UNK> narration delivers us to the <UNK> back to color past br br juliette <UNK> has a brief moment as a nightclub <UNK> in the black white spotlight delivering in <UNK> <UNK> voice the bleak <UNK> <UNK> of the title song this moment is nowadays in retrospect more than a wee bit <UNK> except of course if you're french particularly if you're a french <UNK> er longing for the glorious days of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and your kids riot to retain the <UNK> <UNK> which have <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> economy then you still believe in <UNK> and <UNK> and all such <UNK> irrelevant <UNK> br br david niven has the hardest role having to play with sufficient gusto an aging <UNK> who's yet to grasp that life isn't all about <UNK> <UNK> notions of a hip cool <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deborah kerr delivers her usual <UNK> professional presence convincingly playing the woman who suffers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nose jealousy fulfilling <UNK> shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of there can be only one queen <UNK> in the <UNK> in fact to kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on screen moment br br the dialogue is unnatural i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from french combine the unnatural scripting with <UNK> <UNK> dull <UNK> <UNK> and you can save that <UNK> for another night <UNK> all that the <UNK> <UNK> post production voice dubbing is almost throughout obvious and thus much more than <UNK> this is especially true of the dubbing for <UNK> <UNK> because it <UNK> her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance br br hunky geoffrey <UNK> gets the short end of the stick here a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less than lovely <UNK> voice which when paired with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> unconvincing scenes of puppy love <UNK> was shall we say merely adequate in <UNK> on the river <UNK> ' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros william <UNK> and jack <UNK> instead of being <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br in sum <UNK> <UNK> is pretty to look at but it's shallow immature soap thin <UNK> with <UNK>
<START> sometimes making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting the execution of these ideas into one <UNK> story just didn't work this film was so <UNK> slow and pointless not even robin williams could save this garbage it's obvious barry <UNK> dream fell flat on its face but he should have warned the rest of the world about this <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and <UNK> through the making and <UNK> of <UNK> i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to <UNK> but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eye opening film is humorous in depth serious non <UNK> and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to <UNK> it's simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the <UNK> during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides in depth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between <UNK> china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of <UNK> <UNK> and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on <UNK> that i've seen
<START> good exciting movie although it looks to me that it's not been recorded on location in thailand it still looks realistic nice story about some girls having <UNK> in one of the most beautiful countries on the world in real the <UNK> people are very kind
<START> kalifornia is one of my all time favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90 s the film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal <UNK> and the <UNK> violence they <UNK> upon others one of the film s strongest aspects is it s performances brad pitt is <UNK> great as a trailer trash psycho named early pitt <UNK> his frightening character almost <UNK> juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heart breaking kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes <UNK> and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly <UNK> into a harrowing spree of murder as pitt <UNK> his psychotic personality there are alot of shocking scenes and it all <UNK> to a power house climax that will haunt you for days <UNK> is a film that should really be watched for it s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for it s violence and gore
<START> i couldn't believe it i had to rub my eyes a few times was it true br br yes there were billy dee williams jeff <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tracy <UNK> all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a <UNK> style skin flick set on board a spaceship br br sad as it is alien intruder tries to be unique with a computer virus alien demon <UNK> whatever else you want to call her named ariel <UNK> <UNK> this sort of high tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over seen by their captain williams br br interesting maybe but here everything just plays out like a well padded episode of red shoe <UNK> williams out classes everything right and left and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else anywhere else ah the things people do for money br br the fx are pretty static maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight to video <UNK> like this unfortunately even the female nudity is less than you'd expect sexual innuendo is the real star here and of course it gets all the best scenes br br if you like a movie that's all <UNK> and no brains check out alien intruder of course you'll probably have to look no further than <UNK> at 2 or 3 in the morning br br no stars not even for what star power this flick can <UNK> br br leave this one lost in space
<START> an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv special but find out they still hate each other <UNK> nephew agent richard benjamin tries to get them to work together br br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its non stop one liners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and <UNK> <UNK> was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just <UNK> me the wrong way also his character here is so <UNK> you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great <UNK> off one liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as <UNK> nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me it's worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just good not great <UNK> character really makes this hard to love i give it a 7
<START> the wicker man starring nicolas cage is by no means a good movie but i can't really say it's one i regret watching i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl has a <UNK> followed by another <UNK> followed by a dream sequence with a <UNK> etc but it's just not worth <UNK> on when it comes to a movie like this instead here's five reasons why you should watch the wicker man even though it's bad br br 5 it's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution if nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based br br 4 for a cheesy horror thriller it is really <UNK> pleasing it's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery there are also many nicely composed shots it is a very good looking movie br br 3 nicolas cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature whether you're a fan of his or not it seems as if it's impossible for cage to play a normal guy there is always some kind of <UNK> or <UNK> he brings to the characters he plays and personally i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does whether nicolas cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch he is terrible in the wicker man but in the most wonderful kind of way br br 2 a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti feminist movie ever made see you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society also the similarities between this <UNK> society and a <UNK> colony are pretty interesting and worth noting br br 1 if you're reading this there's probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular a collection of highlights from the movie including cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous <UNK> the <UNK> my eyes line these scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety br br i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollars when you work that out it's about a dollar per reason it's a pretty good deal br br note the <UNK> version of the movie is the best to watch and it's better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on <UNK> which features a cameo from james franco
<START> i saw this film a couple of weeks ago and it's been stuck in my head ever since it stars two <UNK> characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary to get the true story of the <UNK> i had to <UNK> through all of the dvd's bonus material and <UNK> and search the web br br although the <UNK> and their fans not to mention edith and edie themselves <UNK> at the suggestion that this film is exploitative this is exploitation in the <UNK> sense of the word very little effort is every made to explain the <UNK> or how they came to the condition they were in the <UNK> approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous the sound even on the <UNK> re release is poor and difficult to follow although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film it's ironic to compare it to <UNK> <UNK> far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at <UNK> state school in <UNK> island from 1972 four years before grey gardens was shot br br to <UNK> a review in the new <UNK> there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives and a documentary wasn't one of them br br as for edith and edie the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was where the hell is their family they were living in dangerous <UNK> <UNK> conditions how is it that jackie o married to one of the <UNK> men on earth or the wealthy <UNK> family themselves couldn't afford to get edith and edie a decent home or at the very least hire a part time <UNK> or <UNK> to come in and keep an eye on them both it's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire <UNK> family br br although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary bringing in the rich <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> and the whole <UNK> of <UNK> society in the 1970's
<START> weaker entry in the <UNK> <UNK> series with john howard in the role usual funny banter and antics but not much plot barrymore gets something to do as the inspector <UNK> <UNK> to follow <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on a wild <UNK> chase mostly in circles perhaps the budget was <UNK> than usual to rescue poor <UNK> who is being held captive by people who want to lure <UNK> to his doom for those keeping score in this one <UNK> is planning to ask <UNK> to marry him and <UNK> is worried about missing the <UNK> <UNK> it's fun to see <UNK> and <UNK> dressed up as <UNK> to blend in at the <UNK> rest but little of it rises above silly
<START> this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity an <UNK> profound vision his art that springs <UNK> from its natural source brings us an inspiring <UNK> <UNK> his creations with trees white water dashing against rocks fields and rain andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature credit also goes of course to the filmmaker thomas <UNK> who directed photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing br br if you have any feeling for beauty nature and art do not miss this fantastic film
<START> i loved this film i'm a true tom hanks fan and i have always been impressed with all of his work from his most dramatic roles like cast away the green mile saving private ryan forrest <UNK> apollo 13 philadelphia to his hilarious roles like a league of their own turner and <UNK> catch me if you can the lady killers big of course toy story but in this film hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen tyler <UNK> an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career i believe he will do great things paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen he is truly a legend we can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film but still helped make it great the beautiful very talented jennifer jason leigh who's performance in bastard out of <UNK> single white female i will never forget brings her grace to the screen as <UNK> wife in the film and does a superb job liam <UNK> is another found treasure in film he does such a great job with such a small role and like his roles in <UNK> <UNK> and sweet november and i <UNK> of africa he gives a great performance
<START> masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple <UNK> julia anderson <UNK> <UNK> martin <UNK> are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road <UNK> <UNK> works ok he walks away with minor <UNK> unfortunately for <UNK> hers didn't she ended up as <UNK> when she was thrown from the car <UNK> in <UNK> which set <UNK> burning her entire body <UNK> life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured horribly <UNK> from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin <UNK> thinks they should let <UNK> die sue the car <UNK> get rich while <UNK> mum pam linda <UNK> wants to blame cliff get rich save <UNK> however <UNK> has other plans of her own br br this american canadian co production was directed by rob <UNK> whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series while i didn't think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i've seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same still doesn't come close to being as bad as the <UNK> solution 2006 the script by john <UNK> has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i'd say it's a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a <UNK> for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal <UNK> over <UNK> life the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the character's are a bit clich√©d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum the young <UNK> who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here there where it loses it's focus a bit i wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending br br director <UNK> does a good job there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere out and out blood gore there are some fantastic special make up effects as usual there's shots of <UNK> where she has had all of the skin burned off her body the image of her <UNK> head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images make up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in <UNK> 1987 it's sequels then there's the main course at the end where cliff literally <UNK> someone complete with close ups of <UNK> <UNK> skin open him <UNK> it off the muscle putting it into a <UNK> box very messy there are also various <UNK> body parts there's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked br br technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant as most masters of horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made for tv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but there's no big <UNK> in this one br br right to die is another enjoyable somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific <UNK> scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach
<START> i know that originally this film was not a box office hit but in light of recent hollywood releases most of which have been decidedly formula ridden plot less pointless save the blonde chick no matter what drivel feast of all saints certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion the film like the book loses <UNK> in some of the historical background but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human <UNK> and some of its tragic and funny and touching consequences br br and worthy of <UNK> out is the youthful robert <UNK> cast as the leading figure marcel whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his <UNK> of age ' only to be <UNK> disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of <UNK> at the <UNK> of the <UNK> period when i saw the previews featuring the <UNK> blond haired <UNK> i expected a <UNK> a <UNK> a caricature i was pleasantly surprised br br <UNK> davis ruby dee the late ben <UNK> pam <UNK> victoria <UNK> and even <UNK> guy lend vivid imagery and <UNK> skill as actors in the backdrop <UNK> of <UNK> voodoo <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> revolt woven into this tale of human passion hate love family and racial <UNK> in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us
<START> even 20 years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through <UNK> ninjas <UNK> enter a scene fire their <UNK> <UNK> sub machine guns with wild abandon and then <UNK> leave wow how will we find those silent invisible <UNK> just follow the shell <UNK> and smoke painfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a <UNK> total of 3 <UNK> among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non existent then again ninja can't act save yourselves avoid watching at all costs
<START> <UNK> has yet to prove itself every single movie from <UNK> has been abysmal i've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep <UNK> me over and over again and cabin fever is definitely no exception br br i couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad br br here's the plot guy cuts up dead dog for some reason gets infected by random virus <UNK> it to kids at a camp kids start to get infected and die town finds out about it and rather than help them kills them then the water is infected and everyone dies the end br br seriously that's the whole movie br br all the characters are completely retarded you don't care for any of them and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one <UNK> was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie we did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming <UNK> t because this film will make you do that br br and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and <UNK> and again why did this dog attack the girl why did the kid the <UNK> were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him that was part of the two of <UNK> plan wow best plan ever i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release i could barely stomach the dvd let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half it wasn't scary or funny or cool or anything it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to i don't know plant a tree or something it's more <UNK> than this piece of garbage the acting special effects and script are a joke don't ever pick this up br br cabin fever gets one nasty leg <UNK> scene out of 10
<START> i was told it was one of those either you love it or you hate it movies well i loved it obvious hippie era dated and easy symbolism and all so i probably have no taste at all when it comes to antonioni but this and la <UNK> made exactly a decade earlier are my favourites among his movies so far made two years before i was born zabriskie point was supposed to have been <UNK> great american epic but apparently it turned out to be a flop i really can't see why before watching it i'd read that it was rather boring so i <UNK> myself for a very slow movie though i love me a slow movie for my taste zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it while watching it i made a mental note of how european it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of <UNK> <UNK> in almost every urban scene enormous <UNK> <UNK> any human form in sight this <UNK> visual element is obviously there to <UNK> the way that <UNK> <UNK> the individual in american society but then i watched <UNK> straight afterwards which is set in rome in the early 60s and noticed that antonioni often included <UNK> in it as well after all the masterful use of landscapes architecture and <UNK> objects in each frame with or without human beings is an antonioni trademark ¬ñ this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states with more or less understated power and great visual impact he is virtually <UNK> in this skill br br zabriskie point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s but never did mark <UNK> whom i'd already seen in <UNK> <UNK> fine wwi set movie <UNK> <UNK> had a very tragic life and died aged just 27 according to his biography page he <UNK> his 60 000 <UNK> from zabriskie to a <UNK> <UNK> co star daria <UNK> apparently also dennis <UNK> wife later on has the stunning natural beauty and appeal of a young <UNK> <UNK> ¬ñ one of those <UNK> <UNK> that don't need a shred of make up to turn heads like <UNK> she has only <UNK> a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star but at least she didn't die <UNK> most notably zabriskie point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed one that brings home a sense of youthful <UNK> like few i've seen as well as a <UNK> <UNK> ending it may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes but i can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release never has an explosion looked so good and so poetic it seems to be an explosion that <UNK> order rather than bringing chaos
<START> when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of the book i assumed she'd be playing tony <UNK> or <UNK> but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn't read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the 3 different <UNK> that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime br br the biggest error and confusing issue is why would <UNK> a network that <UNK> as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask <UNK> tony and <UNK> about how they knew <UNK> and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book in doing this though they <UNK> the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with in the film these women aren't people they are characters br br in the book <UNK> does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes 30 45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or <UNK> br br it turns out that mary louise parker played <UNK> which was so wrong <UNK> is a catherine zeta jones angelina jolie or maybe even a scarlett <UNK> type she is a woman men can't not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way and once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment she's the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she's always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don't know her game br br in the film <UNK> didn't take <UNK> man the blonde american draft <UNK> who was using <UNK> in the first place but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies and <UNK> did kill the <UNK> before leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed it's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was <UNK> at <UNK> to satisfy those of us who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movie confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all br br and <UNK> husband was dead before <UNK> came in to the picture which was weird since <UNK> took <UNK> business and home life in the book which is why <UNK> hated her so much and she and <UNK> had <UNK> to kill <UNK> husband years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even at the party where <UNK> and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it tony's character was so wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever <UNK> was going down as opposed to the kind of <UNK> mildly <UNK> teacher that she was in the book the film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach <UNK> are off their <UNK> br br they basically tried to make it so <UNK> wasn't necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of <UNK> this meets <UNK> and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to <UNK> or something ridiculous which of course <UNK> <UNK> on to hide <UNK> body which they found <UNK> at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they <UNK> together to do it and then <UNK> also managed to take all of <UNK> money in the process by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had <UNK> so far out in space from what it could and should have been br br if you aren't confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused it was terrible i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by <UNK> what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland br br are there really no <UNK> books that <UNK> could be making at least half decent tv movies of
<START> this is a comedy of morals so occasionally a gentle touch of <UNK> occurs but a <UNK> <UNK> all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything br br this film <UNK> written and directed is a gem that shines perfectly with beautiful acting by all jean louis <UNK> is exquisite as usual and <UNK> schneider is a pearl perfect and glowing that is not to be missed a truly wonderful film
<START> the perfect murder is <UNK> when a wife played by mary ellen <UNK> once the wife to director robert <UNK> who <UNK> this episode who murders her husband with a poker has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit played by a <UNK> hideous larry drake she <UNK> for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse she decides to use an <UNK> once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head to frame the killer for her husband's murder santa killer locks her in a closet and <UNK> the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child br br this episode of tales from the crypt just <UNK> tired material involving the old santa kills theme while also adding the <UNK> used add <UNK> woman murders her husband for a man she's been cheating with routine it's essentially <UNK> trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac there's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions not one of the show's highlights
<START> this film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene <UNK> with the new york art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the <UNK> miss bunny this is torch song trilogy for the <UNK> post teen girls that girl for our <UNK> affected millennium times br br the dialogue is fast and funny and parker <UNK> <UNK> deserves if not an academy award at least a stadium wave of kudos br br of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey and she is perfectly cast like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often self <UNK> and well posey but it all works she is a talented <UNK> an incredible entertainer and this film entertains she carries it on her shoulders like a faux <UNK> wrap and never lets it drop to the floor br br mary is a superficial party <UNK> who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend on a deeper level this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care less in every sense of the word including about other people and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life br br the script is beautifully crafted witty and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt in a role that was much too one dimensional and heavy handed a more nuanced performance from her would have <UNK> the relationship between the two but hey this is comedy a surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and world vision is the <UNK> selling boyfriend we should all be so lucky is he the one for mary or the one that gets away br br i rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history it is not a classic and it is not great art all of which get deeper and <UNK> on re viewing like desperately seeking susan it represents something very true about it's time period but may become irrelevant with time still it has everything an entertaining film needs and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone
<START> although the recent re telling of part of <UNK> epic <UNK> with brad pitt was entertaining once <UNK> with the <UNK> irene <UNK> is breathtaking unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity a chance encounter with this film on one of <UNK> many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems there is no <UNK> or <UNK> in this movie just a <UNK> rich story <UNK> told by actors so real one feels they are <UNK> on a real family in turmoil i think even homer if he really existed would be proud of this telling br br <UNK>
<START> this movie was a real disappointment to me i have been a fan of <UNK> parsons for a long time and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very <UNK> i got the movie on vhs when it came out and was <UNK> by what i saw this film wasn't about his life it was about the aftermath of his death i thought it would be a descent film about <UNK> life and music but they had to make a film about his death i am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies i wanted a film about his life not his infamous death i was very disappointed i wish people would look at his life more then his death the only thing good about this film was its soundtrack this film is a disappointment to any <UNK> parsons fan
<START> arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi millionaire and is attracted to people <UNK> <UNK> in social standing he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a <UNK> br br he drinks quite a lot too and sometimes he is driving while drinking too which of course is not funny ever br br the movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality too john gielgud <UNK> the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages talk about deserving an oscar moore and minnelli have their moments but its gielgud as <UNK> you'll remember the most
<START> following the release of cube 2 <UNK> 2003 and playing off the alleged success of the original cube 1998 director ernie <UNK> takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy the prequel cube zero br br deep in the <UNK> of a giant and <UNK> institution time and place unknown two low <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bennett and <UNK> david <UNK> sit and observe on <UNK> the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of <UNK> <UNK> some of which are <UNK> with death traps told that the people they are <UNK> are convicted <UNK> who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal <UNK> these <UNK> have had no problem with their jobs until <UNK> a <UNK> genius discovers that one of the prisoners a woman named <UNK> stephanie moore never agreed to be put inside the cube suddenly it's realized that perhaps their jobs are not what they seem and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted br br for people that have seen and enjoyed the original cube this prequel will probably not be to your liking it's not that the story does not have potential it's simply that the first cube film never needed to be expanded on standing alone it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a <UNK> about its own message it was also nicely self contained the problem with cube zero is that it destroys some of the <UNK> of the original attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed <UNK> br br what this new film has to offer which is questions about the psychological nature of <UNK> and the <UNK> of evil certainly are good questions to be raised but probably should have been done so on their own merits rather than as a <UNK> of a film that had no such aspirations br br having said this the other traits of the film such as acting and direction and writing are not awful there is a bleak dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and they have certainly managed to <UNK> the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube unfortunately for <UNK> these are not enough positive qualities to save it
<START> a question for all you girls out there if a man you <UNK> never met before accidentally <UNK> you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most <UNK> moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you d phone the police yeah that s what i thought so i <UNK> t swallow the idea of <UNK> <UNK> putting up with the <UNK> attention of connor hill br br mild spoilers br br this is a really dumb story connor hill s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor <UNK> <UNK> so he can have an <UNK> but there s a massive gap in logic here <UNK> t connor have employed a hit man something the <UNK> seem to have ignored and <UNK> t there any <UNK> at the murder scene so why does the whole trial rest on connor <UNK> <UNK> at the time of the murder dumb dumb dumb and it s as predictable as it is brainless br br my <UNK> memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a really crap downhill <UNK>
<START> soylent green is a really good movie actually br br i never would've thought it i don't really like heston in his sci fi efforts he's one of those actors who like superman manages to come across all <UNK> and <UNK> most of the time i prefer more vulnerable heroes and indeed he <UNK> his way through much of soylent green too but as he's supposed to be playing an <UNK> bully i don't really mind br br i can understand why some people would turn their <UNK> up at this movie soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals what do you know it looks just like 1973 and it's lacking in action but i admired the film's vision of a complex corrupt and highly <UNK> society and i was so pleased to see that edward g robinson had such a moving funny final role nice little character moments like when he shares some precious food with heston really make the movie br br the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or <UNK> are up to funny isn't it to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie
<START> daniel day lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real br br i remember many years ago we had a party in our house the friends came over we were sitting around the table eating drinking the wine talking laughing having a good time the tv was on there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing the glasses did not <UNK> the <UNK> did not move the food was getting cold on the <UNK> we could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of <UNK> with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor when he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three <UNK> the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character br br jim <UNK> my left foot is an riveting <UNK> bio drama about christy brown the man who was born with cerebral <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life br br i like every one of day <UNK> performances i have mixed feelings about his performance in <UNK> but i believe that his greatest role was christy brown in my left foot
<START> <UNK> de <UNK> is a very good the story isn't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in <UNK> but it gives us an idea of how it was like the fiction of the story isn't of great interest but it doesn't spoil the movie the heroic actions of captain <UNK> <UNK> aren't <UNK> and the film is also a tribute for his deeds captain <UNK> <UNK> remains one of the greatest heroes of the <UNK> of april revolution br br all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully <UNK> looks beautiful as ever don't miss it i liked this film very much
<START> i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture and was <UNK> surprised at its more <UNK> features first off the film is undeniably cheaply made with its cardboard sets limited settings and creative scientific props the acting <UNK> from very poor the two <UNK> barely professional <UNK> <UNK> as the leading man gothic <UNK> leslie daniels as the assistant kurt to first rate with virginia <UNK> in the title role as the <UNK> victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her <UNK> <UNK> passions the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this <UNK> issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be this film is a thinking film in many ways however don't be too fooled by its real intent it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his <UNK> in medical science who wishes to <UNK> together his dead <UNK> head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul one other very bright aspect of the film is the <UNK> music which <UNK> strongly every time the doctor <UNK> town for female <UNK>
<START> first off i'd like to point out that sam <UNK> is nowhere to be seen in this film what's a movie without sam <UNK> did anyone see event horizon d wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls <UNK> with rocket <UNK> does sound cool but sadly isn't nope no sam <UNK> no good movie i recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent d wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a sam <UNK> film apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so <UNK> a list of sam <UNK> movies i recommend br br jurassic park dead calm hunt for red october event horizon not jurassic park three br br overall d wars is a pile
<START> i went to see <UNK> fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this don't miss this one
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but it was just <UNK> the acting was ultra hammy the plot was annoying and the pace was slow <UNK> <UNK> the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end twenty <UNK> into a films and i'm praying for an ending sure some of the visuals were nice but c'mon guys i mean really and for a movie about a guy <UNK> magical <UNK> there really wasn't much music to speak of the music there was was annoying and boring there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too those were also annoying mainly this film managed to bore me and creep me out at the same time br br i'm glad its over i need to go see <UNK> and wash this bad taste out of my mouth
<START> saw this movie when it came out in 1959 left a lasting impression great group of actors a little short <UNK> but a great movie all the same have only seen once since then and that was some time ago hopefully they'll put it out on dvd if they haven't already
<START> samuel fuller brings his <UNK> playful and stylish direction to this seedy <UNK> story and manages to create one of the <UNK> gems of 1950s cinema br br richard widmark plays a petty thief tough guy a role he <UNK> over the course of many movies who <UNK> a young <UNK> jean peters <UNK> on a new york subway and with it a piece of much wanted <UNK> this is 1953 so of course the <UNK> is property of <UNK> spies who will stop at nothing to get it back when the girl shows up at <UNK> <UNK> shack sent by an abusive boyfriend to <UNK> the film widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her <UNK> down for big money the plot <UNK> people start dying and widmark and peters fall in love br br fuller handles the love story clumsily but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction it's as if he included a love story under <UNK> and so made it intentionally unbelievable as love stories so frequently were and still are in hollywood films peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough new <UNK> cookie part gangster <UNK> and part damsel in distress when violence occurs against her we genuinely care about her well being and it's typical of <UNK> <UNK> ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a <UNK> conclusion br br but the ultimate success of pickup on south street rests <UNK> on the world weary shoulders of thelma ritter who plays moe a <UNK> lady who makes money any way she can whether that be selling <UNK> or acting as a police <UNK> ritter gives the performance of her career in a breathtaking monologue she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad <UNK> of her character's life and the <UNK> she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle crime and <UNK> it's as if every character ritter ever played <UNK> for one brief instant to give <UNK> to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to <UNK> in those other movies the scene is the highlight of <UNK> film and a highlight of 50s cinema period br br grade a
<START> the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures rather than characters i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies i'm talking about the tv series not the full length movies but some of them were pretty cool and i like most people found <UNK> doo to be an <UNK> but this series is pure garbage as soon as i saw the animation and heard the characters and i use that term loosely speak i <UNK> also mystery inc was a team and without the entire crew to compliment each other it just seems like opening up a box of <UNK> to find someone has already ate the best ones and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants what's new scooby doo was better than this if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series include the elements that made the series endure so long the entire cast of characters and quality animation they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came
<START> the horse is indeed a fine animal <UNK> depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more <UNK> in an animation flick br br the animation is simply <UNK> the fine animation forms the <UNK> of the beauty that the horses <UNK> across the flick more so when the <UNK> <UNK> diverse <UNK> jumps across <UNK> and <UNK> waters br br soundtrack too is very impressive the wonderful <UNK> music <UNK> you to appreciate the movie br br they say the story of the west was written from the <UNK> of a horse huh well the story of a fine horse sure was written from the <UNK> of the west br br all in all this movie is clearly up there with the best it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched would be a very fine choice on a lonely night an easy 9 10
<START> although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters br br this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been <UNK> for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether br br this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no <UNK> from having watched a film once it's over i loved movies such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
<START> i saw this when it was in the theater it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations and other related psychological factors now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining it builds to an excellent climax then it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it besides being a very poetic description in my experience it was just not strong enough my wife and i were well how can i say this we were upset i mean we paid money invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly in fact my wife said it best it did not end it just stopped
<START> this film essentially deals with inspector <UNK> arch nemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the now peaceful city of metropolis <UNK> plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer <UNK> <UNK> to help destroy <UNK> popularity sadly the film fails miserably the series was great but it was <UNK> nearly 20 years later with tragic results without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just doesn't cut it anymore dr claw is not only visually less frightening but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original <UNK> self granted this is a children's movie but the plot is so painfully weak heaven <UNK> i mention the animation that it <UNK> in comparison to the original series someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed she now has some quasi punk rebellious clothing style and doesn't play half the role that she did in the tv series the <UNK> talks as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars maybe i'm just a kid who loved the show who's grown up jaded but i thought that the live action version was more pain than i could bear but now they go and spring this complete <UNK> down of the quality tv series on us it's more than i can take
<START> the sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch it's smart it's quirky it's funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the <UNK> world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really don't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch br br further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you don't love them too i've laughed at their <UNK> been torn when they've made <UNK> in judgement and felt scared at the sheer <UNK> of a serious criminal br br the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext people aren't always as they seem and the stark contrast between <UNK> and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals <UNK> up to even the odds br br if you haven't already you most definitely should
<START> i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton zelah clarke adaptation of jane eyre because i'd just written an article about the 2006 bbc jane eyre for <UNK> br br so i approached watching this the way i'd approach doing <UNK> br br i was irritated at first the lighting in this version is bad everyone everything is washed out in a bright white <UNK> light that in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the characters br br and the sound is poorly recorded i felt like i was listening to a high school play br br and the <UNK> make up is way too heavy br br and the sets don't fully convey the gothic mood of the novel they are too <UNK> too martha stewart i just can't see <UNK> rochester <UNK> such martha stewart domestic <UNK> orson welles' rochester lived in cave like <UNK> very appropriate to the <UNK> gothic mood br br and yet with all those <UNK> not only is this the best jane eyre i've seen it may be the best adaptation of any novel i've ever seen br br this jane eyre in spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first time br br the critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who <UNK> the book and didn't need it to be any less <UNK> or any less christian or any more <UNK> up this <UNK> <UNK> to the novel <UNK> actually wrote is its finest asset br br <UNK> wrote a darn good book there's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus while other <UNK> <UNK> and easier <UNK> have disappeared br br as a long time jane eyre fan i was <UNK> against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is <UNK> not handsome jane and rochester are <UNK> famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome br br but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away i've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and <UNK> love for jane dalton brings the <UNK> rochester to <UNK> life on screen br br rochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really can't tell if he's going to hurt jane or himself in his desperation br br <UNK> <UNK> his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart it's stunning br br and here's the key thing the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly life destroying secret br br no other actor i've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby <UNK> doesn't even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a <UNK> bar i would say that guy is trouble don't even look at him he's that <UNK> with <UNK> down agony br br zelah clarke is not only overall the best jane i've seen she's one of the very few <UNK> whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the 2006 version <UNK> did not describe a <UNK> <UNK> jane with finely <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> lips rather charlotte <UNK> jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not pretty br br zelah has a small mouth close set eyes and a bit of a nose she's truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the <UNK> to the book br br some described her a cold or boring no she's true to the book <UNK> jane is not a red hot mama she's a <UNK> <UNK> teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as <UNK> do here the <UNK> jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully <UNK> <UNK> if you want to truly <UNK> her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really is br br i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very good br br in spite of its <UNK> to the text this version like every other version i've seen <UNK> away from fully <UNK> the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is central br br helen burns <UNK> jane in christianity thus giving her a <UNK> counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed <UNK> life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her <UNK> of a key marriage <UNK> that isn't made fully clear here br br in any case charlotte <UNK> wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones i've seen mines and <UNK> the novel best of any adaptation i've seen and that says a lot br br other versions that don't fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you don't care about what charlotte <UNK> has to say about child abuse or the <UNK> of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester br br this version like <UNK> novel realizes that everything <UNK> wrote about jane's experiences at <UNK> and her relationship to st john are part of what makes jane's relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is
<START> i understand there was some conflict between leigh and the great maggie smith during the filming understandable when you put one of the world's greatest actresses of all time smith of course with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film
<START> i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor actress to get people any people to come see it and give the movie exposure bobby <UNK> played by <UNK> and his partner <UNK> paul <UNK> make an excellent combination finding eccentric <UNK> bates a name actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra <UNK> <UNK> with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content
<START> although the director tried the filming was made in <UNK> and <UNK> this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies while the duration is very long but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon who doesn't seem to understand the demands of his role
<START> an adaption of the book <UNK> <UNK> this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher derek luke who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist <UNK> <UNK> denzel washington a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington br br this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn't win an oscar i think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked i strongly recommend this film to everyone you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become <UNK> with this young man that is antwone fisher br br if you like inspirational true stories then watch antwone fisher br br thank you
<START> winchester 73 is the story of a man jimmy stewart obsessed with getting back his <UNK> possession a repeating rifle made by winchester the rifle keeps changing hands and stewart <UNK> keeps after it this 1950 b w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western and the <UNK> often seem more like modern day gangsters than old fashioned <UNK> shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man charles drake she may marry she ends up falling for stewart but not before she is passed around a bit winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters watch for a young dan <UNK> as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role a woefully miscast will <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK>
<START> here's my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well br br the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all <UNK> con it's like the <UNK> but without that film's level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by <UNK> was supposed to be some sort of attack on <UNK> at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it <UNK> beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay <UNK> lines the way she reads them sound as if they're inner monologue or narration which they aren't with the arrival of <UNK> things pick up br br the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be i was expecting <UNK> ring a <UNK> <UNK> lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don't it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and <UNK> up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he's far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their <UNK> <UNK> quality what's more strange is that other than this the film doesn't look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with <UNK> <UNK> ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything <UNK> br br i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it's a weird <UNK> of theatre and film that just doesn't work that doesn't mean the movie is bad it isn't it's often extremely entertaining the best <UNK> is in the middle br br it's standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay <UNK> gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a <UNK> <UNK> she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a <UNK> game room where con men work in a back room i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting <UNK> to come in were they expecting she'd write a <UNK> was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however br br and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little <UNK> ones to be the most fun we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as <UNK> is br br we see the ending coming and then we didn't see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps <UNK> back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second <UNK> walked into the house of games she found her true calling br br i'm going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems <UNK> stick with it after the half hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch <UNK> <UNK> ross again james <UNK> did him better br br
<START> i had never read shakespeare's hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before but i got pulled into this movie's grasp shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements br br but now on to the movie br br i found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus were able to <UNK> it quite well <UNK> in romeo and juliet is nothing compared to kenneth branagh and the king the thing i liked about this was that it worked very well as a movie and not as a play you are studying you don't need to be <UNK> with shakespeare to relate to all the misery hamlet has to go through i would recommend this movie to a wide audience br br that's my two cents
<START> br br if you like rap or hip hop watch this movie although it's funny if you don't get the references as a straight comedy br br haven't seen much of the much hyped <UNK> but what i did see didn't have the heart that this little <UNK> has br br haven't heard from the people involved since which is a surprise the film is very similar to spinal tap which is no bad thing and i think a lot of the dialogue while priceless in tap is funnier here probably because i'm more into rap than rock <UNK> days so my own judgment does cloud that point br br the rap songs are funny as hell and it's basically spot the reference for most of the film not all of them are in your face which means the physical comedy and the one liners get <UNK> over the take offs br br great fun one to watch twice if there ever was a movie
<START> despite the english title this seems to have little to do with <UNK> and much more to do with a power hungry <UNK> who seeks the <UNK> stone wants gold made from lead <UNK> blood <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> de <UNK> and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they <UNK> his position or when he needs <UNK> for their blood he's basically <UNK> on by his lady love and an <UNK> that he's employed and it's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession unfortunately there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like <UNK> and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks and the film at least has a good look to it but otherwise there's little about this to recommend little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all and most unusual for a <UNK> naschy film not really any unintentional humor therefore 4 out of 10
<START> <UNK> it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution it was easy to understand the contest but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else or they shows also the period before or after this fact here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts it could also be seen as a kind of documentary the movie <UNK> to these two people showing as normal they were not like common heroes because the revolution come from people although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just <UNK> as the main characters nice colors and lights during the whole movie excellent work for the director being her first movie she doesn't fall to the banal way well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd the character of <UNK> main one is well made and there is also a good interpretation for <UNK> <UNK> able to show <UNK> limits this not being an hero
<START> while santa claus <UNK> the martians is usually <UNK> as one of the worse films ever made this mexican made film from 1959 is so bad it makes <UNK> look like it's a wonderful life you have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking perhaps they meant it as a third world allegory about <UNK> greed and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they just weren't very good the same production company made an even more disturbing version of little red riding hood in which the <UNK> obsession with our heroine has <UNK> hints of <UNK> perhaps this was the inspiration for <UNK> back to santa claus instead of the north pole jolly old saint nicholas <UNK> in a satellite in <UNK> earth <UNK> shades of mst3k instead of <UNK> his toys are made by children chosen from around the world and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice the result is like an <UNK> outer space sweat shop it's enough to turn you off christmas forever this and other low rent mexican <UNK> films were dubbed in english and widely distributed in the u s in the early 1960s no wonder the sixties became such a <UNK> period in american history the baby <UNK> who were forced to endure these family films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary
<START> i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark skinned and <UNK> didn't have fair hair like almost always the cast played very well too and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so <UNK> but i must say some scenes were acted too <UNK> for such a character as <UNK> i have always thought she is very modest and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with <UNK> although it was happening only in <UNK> imagination at first i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and <UNK> was shown so openly but as a whole i liked the film and especially <UNK> crying in the dying scene
<START> yeah cheap shot i know but this movie is a great example of how a collection of <UNK> of <UNK> political turmoil love lust can be combined <UNK> to great critical acclaim see also <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movie <UNK> along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences in one scene i counted three different <UNK> <UNK> accents affected by the actors and displays of state might run amok yet fails to tie them together into the coherent <UNK> <UNK> offered and in its over long three hours it manages almost completely to <UNK> over <UNK> the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot and in this manner sacrifices the <UNK> central <UNK> of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs it also fails to even include token screen time for <UNK> son used in the novel to <UNK> some of the political points <UNK> was making in the novel combined with the <UNK> soundtrack these flaws make this movie's three hours <UNK> <UNK> in tone yet light in content
<START> this is a <UNK> 4 hours remake of the rider <UNK> story with the usual added female and an <UNK> subplot with russian soldiers seeking a stone of power buried along with the treasure of king <UNK> it's very well shot giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa and very well acted patrick <UNK> is an excellent alan <UNK> and allison <UNK> is attractive as elizabeth <UNK> who hires <UNK> to help rescue her father <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> hood as <UNK> and the leader of the russian soldiers not named in <UNK> listing are also memorable for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it this one is well told and except that it's too long i enjoyed it 6 10
<START> a remarkable piece of documentary giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself for further evidence check out some of the comments on imdb <UNK> extremely <UNK> with oliver <UNK> <UNK> which is mainly an in depth examination of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i don't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being or yet another in the long line of <UNK> latin american <UNK> nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of <UNK> it's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions but i've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what's at stake and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup someone says in the film we're making history and that's exactly what the film feels like it's capturing outstanding stuff
<START> these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation and eventually eliminate altogether some naive person in order to take over their life fatal attraction pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle single white female and a thousand made for tv movies are some examples of this but while a few especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid suspenseful characters or a few plot twists <UNK> entry plays everything by the book and were it not for the <UNK> of its stars kurt <UNK> ray <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a <UNK> steele miniseries br br <UNK> plays michael <UNK> an <UNK> naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately he quietly <UNK> his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop ray liotta a typically <UNK> villain with no limits for his power at first <UNK> with <UNK> probably only pretending to do so the cop befriends the couple but soon enough the cops wants <UNK> out of the way so destroying the guys life nearly any way he can which is pretty easy when you're a cop and when you're the cop who has <UNK> the guy's security system in his house in order to take over and presumably get his wife it seems less ends oriented and more like the cop just wants to prove his power the wife is more like a <UNK> in other words than an end and the story plays out entirely by the book you can probably predict every <UNK> before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies from the shocking moment our main naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud <UNK> by the <UNK> villain to the turn around he's not really dead finale
<START> most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who <UNK> great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it's just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty <UNK> remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden <UNK> being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can't stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to <UNK> more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this see a good movie br br 1 10 stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie
<START> i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it i loved it a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the ex con and a pace that kept things flowing without being <UNK> br br a much much better film than the same director's de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which was boring and unbelievable br br the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid certainly and far from <UNK> beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it superb i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is i've seen a bit of <UNK> wife and a bit of the <UNK> and they both looked like rubbish and i've seen all of de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and that certainly is rubbish she seems to have a few coming up so i'll keep my fingers crossed
<START> i just want to make one thing clear i love michael <UNK> but this film really lets him down his acting is still superb he's still as charming as ever and he still looks great but the film itself is a load of rubbish natasha <UNK> i'm sorry to say it comes over bit <UNK> you're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend who's own sub storyline is a little weird myself and my family who sat down and watched the film with me were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didn't fit with what was going on in the scenes however even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film i could forgive the leading <UNK> butch <UNK> i could forgive the <UNK> characters that were thrown in to the mix and i could forgive the poor choice of musical <UNK> but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left <UNK> if you're a michael <UNK> fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead
<START> this is a fascinating film especially to old movie buffs and historians i am both during the first half of the <UNK> century sadly black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters as a result theaters <UNK> to black audiences wanted to show films <UNK> the black experience and showing black actors in many cases the films were essentially similar plot wise to standard hollywood fare but with a much much lower budget and usually horrid production values you really can't fault the film makers they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company as a result they had to make due with a lot less including an over <UNK> on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for re shooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene <UNK> film starring <UNK> <UNK> instead <UNK> was a light skinned man from mixed <UNK> and he starred in several similar cowboy films in each he sings a little fights a little though very poorly and loves a little everything you need in a cowboy believe it or not <UNK> is still alive at age <UNK> br br the general plot was <UNK> from an <UNK> picture complete with <UNK> items such as <UNK> out west the problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally <UNK> and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awful br br now this does not mean that the film isn't worth seeing only that it <UNK> with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher one reviewer oddly scored this film a 10 how this can be with all the problems is beyond me however i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems the plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and it's a very important piece of american history but a 10 br br by the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost white skinned <UNK> is paired with short <UNK> and exceptionally dark <UNK> <UNK> as his brother also spencer williams may be familiar to you he played andy on tv's <UNK> <UNK> andy
<START> first off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci fi channel has produced that isn't to say that grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better the flaws of the film come from character design character absurd <UNK> to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part the acting br br when speaking of character design i of course mean the way our heroes and villains look beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous <UNK> rather than warriors of <UNK> strength that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly grendel looks like the hulk but with strange <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> br br the characters are very limited beowulf is same from beginning to end however <UNK> a useless sidekick achieved some two <UNK> due thanks to his romantic subplot and <UNK> gets some notion as well as he becomes less <UNK> br br much like <UNK> there are useless <UNK> to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material the <UNK> that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous i'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set besides <UNK> there's <UNK> such as the underlying themes of christianity and <UNK> as well as the consequences of lying br br the special effects are mighty terrible grendel and his mother <UNK> are poorly conceived and as such they're portrayal on screen is less than believable br br the music is overbearing especially when a character dies br br all in all this is not sci <UNK> worst film to date no it is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best the only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there br br i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert <UNK> take on the ancient story of beowulf simply because this film grendel is only half the tale and not the whole thing which <UNK> this movie a three star review
<START> the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein and there's a very good reason for that but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions and the invisible ray is certainly one of them the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before even way back in 1936 but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director <UNK> <UNK> has created a very nifty little original horror film the plot focuses on the good hearted dr <UNK> rukh a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown <UNK> element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of <UNK> colleagues to find it however tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element which makes him glow in the dark and also sends him mad br br the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day boris karloff and bela lugosi and both give excellent performances karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in and it's a great performance from him also it's nice to see a bit of <UNK> from lugosi the film does get off to a rather slow start but things soon start to pick up the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine literally the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting and it does work very well the film remains interesting throughout and <UNK> down to a very decent climax that <UNK> everything up nicely overall the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties but it's a very good one and comes recommended
<START> please for the love of god don't watch it now saying that i know what you're thinking it can't be that bad can it if everyone says it as bad as they say i have to watch it don't do it it'll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a <UNK> <UNK> you'll be <UNK> for life the image will never leave you i could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick the acting is the worst i've ever seen and i've seen <UNK> if you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this movie don't say i haven't warned you the cover and storyline are a trap zombies satire shaun of the dead was great this movie must be the same right no the writing crap directing garbage acting there was no acting still not convinced then forever your soul will be tormented
<START> i saw most of my bollywood bride today at the <UNK> film festival in new york and had to leave the theater due to feelings of <UNK> <UNK> up within me i've seen bollywood movies and i've seen <UNK> of bollywood movies this movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be so it ended up being a joke on itself br br it seems to have been <UNK> copied from movies like bride and prejudice and bollywood calling and what a sloppy lazy job at that how can bollywood ever be <UNK> off of its determination to stick to <UNK> well <UNK> scripts is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real fascinating stories that surely exist and <UNK> in the land of a billion people the over smart auto driver the cow on the street gratuitous scenes of foreign locations pointless scenes of <UNK> streets they're all in there every possible clich√© about india has been <UNK> included so <UNK> predictable ugh acting performances are weak across the board except for <UNK> <UNK> who is talented and beautiful one wonders why she would pick a project like this
<START> this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking through the jungle up a rocky cliff near a river or lake to pad out the running time the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big <UNK> bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of <UNK> <UNK> fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras for a zombie cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn't see an uncut version
<START> i have not read the book that this was based upon inspired by this being some of the others are film roles the last work of john ritter rip one hopes that it is hilarious and it is almost every time he's present in this as a matter of fact most of the cast supporting as well as regular play off each other well and the material tends to be great he plays paul <UNK> the father of three teenagers <UNK> the typical guy of that age <UNK> the <UNK> middle child who fights for causes and awareness and bridget the fashion loving popular <UNK> <UNK> makes a return to being the female lead in a sit com and her character is far removed from peggy <UNK> the show changed somewhat after mr <UNK> company passed on and for a while they couldn't seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs or being poignant and making sure to be <UNK> one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that it could still be quite good some of the <UNK> were fortunate if you like david spade most of his part consists of him doing his <UNK> and had stuff to say my personal favorite episode is in the last season the humor is a nice mix of dumb person jokes mainly related to the high <UNK> silliness dark comedy and crude material this dealt with sex and other adult topics but never in a graphic manner the language is mild and on occasion moderately strong i recommend this to any fan of those who made it 8 10
<START> like freddy's revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great <UNK> to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an <UNK> to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br i've not alot to say about this it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over <UNK> and <UNK> possibly only the <UNK> direction saves it from being the worst in the series
<START> this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't care what the critics say it's bad i think the problem is with <UNK> novel it's not that it's <UNK> it's just that like 99 of his work it's pretentious and <UNK> he seems to be <UNK> with himself his characters come off as <UNK> <UNK> and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his <UNK> <UNK> poetry that was truly awful i just don't understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the self <UNK> in his novels make for <UNK> reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about <UNK> were <UNK> maybe i just missed something but i don't think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a <UNK> collection dvd no way is this movie that essential
<START> i suck at gratuitous <UNK> references so i'm just going to write a <UNK> flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a i'm going to shoot the <UNK> just to impress <UNK> foster <UNK> way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50's horror film only alot more fun look for the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> reference to know what i mean what <UNK> shines through in the movie is <UNK> or should that be <UNK> absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it <UNK> times since i <UNK> should get around to buying a copy the <UNK> version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free br br p s another great performance from edie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
<START> first off i hadn't seen the blob since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers but this simple little tale of <UNK> horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be br br sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world but the blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the <UNK> creature when then adults don't believe them in fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy colored world and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him br br to sum up if you can take off your <UNK> irony <UNK> there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye
<START> citizen x is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of <UNK> worst serial killers what makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place the soviet union in the 1980's br br mild spoilers br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by stephen rea is a newly promoted <UNK> investigator for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he discovers past and present <UNK> murders apparently by the same person the murders are <UNK> because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence he is driven to find and stop the killer his only tools are his dedication skill and honesty his obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the soviet system that <UNK> the search for truth his <UNK> would have led to failure were it not for his boss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> donald sutherland <UNK> is a politically <UNK> <UNK> who understands the game and knows how to deal with the soviet <UNK> however he also shares <UNK> desire to bring a murderer to justice even if the official party line is there are no serial killers in the soviet union br br the cast is outstanding the locations and sets are perfect <UNK> of latter day soviet life randy <UNK> score is particularly good br br more important this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and <UNK> this was a made for cable movie by hbo films and they have become a great <UNK> for films that would otherwise never be made
<START> i saw this movie at an actual movie theater probably the 2 00 one with my cousin and uncle we were around 11 and 12 i guess and really into scary movies i remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us pick the movie and we probably never got to do that again and <UNK> disappointed afterwards just boring and not scary the only redeeming thing i can remember was corky <UNK> from silver <UNK> and that wasn't all that great just someone i recognized i've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst this was from what i can recall one of the most boring non scary waste of our collective 6 and a waste of film i have read some of the reviews that say it is worth a watch and i say too each his own but i wouldn't even bother not even so bad it's good
<START> i regret that i've seen this movie can't believe that the creator of best intentions and <UNK> the <UNK> could make such a bleak and boring film what a waste
<START> this film reminds me a lot of the anti drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about tom hanks and his buddies are role playing but there are no <UNK> lots of <UNK> and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group quite funny but misguided i wonder how many poor kids had their d d stuff destroyed and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction as a film it's basically an after school special bad acting although hanks does show some of his talent and relationship talks and no one seems to be having any fun it seems these films have a psychological focus on <UNK> starting on the road to <UNK> which is more serious apparently and requires you to <UNK> down and do the things everyone else does despite my vote of 2 this is worth watching due to its unique genre scare films which i personally find quite funny
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies 1981 is absolutely the worst movie ever made <UNK> even the witless plan 9 from outer space the lampoon film <UNK> in three separate and <UNK> vignettes each featuring different performers the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities br br well maybe there is one another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice and he's right misses <UNK> and <UNK> flash their <UNK> <UNK> in part one and part two respectively but their glamorous displays are alas wasted the directors seem to have forgotten that even t a needs a credible story to surround it and there's none in sight br br the third segment starring <UNK> benson and richard widmark is the most disgusting of the three and an unfortunate choice as the <UNK> of this film benson plays an eager <UNK> young policeman <UNK> <UNK> for his first day of duty ready to rid the streets of evil he is paired with an old cynical cop played by widmark and when these oil and water partners set out on their first <UNK> together we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures maybe just maybe the cynical old <UNK> will be <UNK> by his new <UNK> <UNK> sense of duty and loyalty maybe all will end happily after all but alas this movie heads straight for the toilet with no redemption no happy ending no coherent story of any kind br br before national lampoon goes to the movies i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out unfortunately i hadn't seen the half of it br br
<START> being a music student myself i thought a movie taking place in a <UNK> might be fun to watch little did i know i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears this movie was implausible throughout it's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a <UNK> and doesn't know a thing about classical music let me give you just a few examples 1 there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical <UNK> with no classical training whatsoever just having a nice pop voice isn't enough besides that's a different thing altogether another genre different technique it's like playing the <UNK> when <UNK> for a <UNK> class 2 how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury if she wasn't a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why weren't we told so 3 being able to read music is a necessity if you're to major in music 4 how did angela get a hold of that video tape that would have been kept <UNK> for the <UNK> eyes only now either she got the tape from one of the <UNK> or the script writers just didn't have a clue i wonder which 5 the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did not yes she was able to sing the notes but carmen is a <UNK> soprano while <UNK> voice seemed to be much lighter in <UNK> not at all <UNK> with that song 6 worst of all not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesn't even try to hide it the <UNK> that angela sings is <UNK> beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the <UNK> where it is cut short in a <UNK> way <UNK> would roll over in his grave the <UNK> from carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was <UNK> at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music it's stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric <UNK> and it's almost as good as britney spears i know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research anyhow i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well <UNK> but without that i really can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one it's good for a laugh
<START> i laughed all the way through this rotten movie it's so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep they're lesbians nothing rings true in this lifetime for women with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn't take it doesn't help there's a wealthy distant mother who <UNK> of her daughter's new relationship a sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid <UNK> <UNK> must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the <UNK> teenage kids <UNK> no cliche is left <UNK>
<START> we went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of my favourite <UNK> we had our 6 year old daughter with us she wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents the parts we did see were only occasionally humorous mostly either too silly or gross i would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9 12 if that it's definitely not suited for younger children from what i've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to <UNK> the past you'll probably be disappointed
<START> i can't say i'm all that experienced in misty <UNK> flicks having seen only a handful but it's obvious that this was made on a <UNK> and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb <UNK> rip off inside a garage it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing the film only runs for forty five minutes and this is definitely a good thing as there isn't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer it has something to do with an evil nazi scientist who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could a mummy which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty this film's version of tomb <UNK> who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings this film could have been better it's got misty <UNK> for a start and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even <UNK> <UNK> caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot although that isn't really a bad thing obviously this is a rubbish film but the fact that it's short is to its credit and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex you could do worse
<START> i am usually disappointed by network movies even <UNK> that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people however this one is the worst of the worst the screenplay is weak and the acting especially that of <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> i've <UNK> off to see my <UNK> school plays and been treated to better acting <UNK> acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks when she tries to express fear anger or grief it's extremely hollow because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment scary things won't scare you sad things won't make you sad romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive first to die says a lot about this movie
<START> grey matter aka the brain machine but the video people thought better of that the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977 it's that kind of movie the government has some kind of <UNK> interest in this <UNK> <UNK> project that has <UNK> four people who turn out to be roughly a <UNK> a horny priest a <UNK> veteran and a <UNK> who got an abortion to sit in a <UNK> room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way my s has better production values than this it held my interest though just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing <UNK> in four guys in a room character drama the answer a <UNK> about how science is inferior to god thanks a lot it's like opening a <UNK> egg and getting your <UNK> <UNK> jigsaw puzzle the priest is played by james <UNK> p <UNK> best the <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> simon <UNK> also featuring very very very long establishing and transition shots in great <UNK> this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention
<START> i don't doubt that the critics <UNK> this movie especially the artsy <UNK> who need a <UNK> this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of <UNK> <UNK> or more recently don <UNK> it won't shake the world or change movies forever what it will do is entertain when all is said done that's the most important thing anyway watch this movie forget your troubles it even has a simple kind moral message at no extra charge i always loved <UNK> tv show when i lived in la she did not really steal her <UNK> from <UNK> any more than <UNK> did from the original <UNK> <UNK> this sort of <UNK> character belongs to whoever does it best <UNK> peterson does it best long live elvira we need more of these kind of movies there are never enough the villain william morgan <UNK> was also excellent he exudes a wonderful <UNK> <UNK> i could find no technical faults the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets my profound <UNK> to the director james <UNK> all his crew
<START> oh god where to begin bad acting characters you just don't care about are they american or british they seem to think they are in america because where else is this enormous forest in the <UNK> br br one big fault they are driving all night through these woods unless they are going around and around they'd have been in scotland come the morning when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over br br and they're <UNK> don't work so what do they do split up of course make it easier to be picked off so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to <UNK> for the unconscious woman so what do they do rather than make her comfortable <UNK> her head cover her up or even move her off the <UNK> road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 <UNK> away and all the time they have a <UNK> van they could put her in br br and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were <UNK> from heaven to live amongst us so what do they do <UNK> on sexual relations with any men they encounter no they bite huge <UNK> out of them and rip their heads off i think they are missing the point br br these are not gorgeous sexually <UNK> former angels they are <UNK> vampires and as for tom <UNK> saying how breath <UNK> beautiful they are well those <UNK> have good bodies but nothing special in the face <UNK> the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible <UNK> br br rubbish film waste of <UNK> 30 from my local library
<START> overall i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers br br however i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and <UNK> closer one scene especially where adrian <UNK> character is questioning rosario <UNK> about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive <UNK> character is questioning julia roberts although it is acted with less <UNK> and intensity in love also note that anna is the name of both <UNK> and <UNK> character can't be coincidence now closer is based on patrick <UNK> play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur <UNK> <UNK> so i'm not sure how this connection formed br br anyone have an idea
<START> what irving <UNK> did in making this film today would never be attempted again making a chinese story with <UNK> players even if they are of the caliber of paul muni <UNK> rainer <UNK> <UNK> and walter connolly among others br br perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a <UNK> pearl buck who got a <UNK> prize for her novel in 1932 ms buck daughter of chinese <UNK> probably brought china closer to the consciousness of america than any other person not the political struggles of china but the lives and <UNK> of the every day people we find in the good earth unfortunately later on pearl buck became an <UNK> for the <UNK> china of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in all its virtues and <UNK> the rest of her literary <UNK> never matched the good earth br br in the <UNK> there is a great description of comparing china to australia by peter ustinov when asked the difference ustinov said china was very big and very full and australia was very big and very empty that's what you see in the good earth china very big and very full of people more than she can deal with at times br br the good earth tells the story of wang lung paul muni as a young man who <UNK> a wife from a large house where she was a slave the woman o <UNK> <UNK> rainer bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have <UNK> <UNK> revolution and a climatic <UNK> plague br br <UNK> rainer won the second of two <UNK> oscars for portraying o <UNK> she may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player oscar performance with the least amount of dialog everything she does practically is done with facial expressions her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles i think only john mills in <UNK> daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man br br muni is not always <UNK> of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture rainer helps in the field bears and raises the kids does the <UNK> when muni becomes a man of property he takes a chinese second <UNK> wife who causes him a lot of grief still rainer <UNK> bears it all still muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and <UNK> writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is <UNK> br br we've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just kung fu movies i'm surprised the good earth of all films has not been remade at this point i'll bet the chinese government would even let some american company do it on an actual location br br till then we've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy
<START> it's a funny business reviewing movies these days when <UNK> emotions and emotional <UNK> are <UNK> over straightforward sentimentality it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings br br soon after <UNK> jury duties at the <UNK> <UNK> i managed to catch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br after the screening i watched folks <UNK> <UNK> out of the theatre hall <UNK> eyed men women and reviewers alike even the director of the <UNK> obviously a hardened viewer of cinema <UNK> to having been caught <UNK> and found himself crying three <UNK> way into this <UNK> sentimental experience br br but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after despite being <UNK> moved by the film many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non <UNK> in their writing apparently post <UNK> they had put on their thinking cap and consequently missed out on what i felt was the genius about <UNK> br br allow me to explain br br set in pre war japan the story of <UNK> revolves around one writer's family and their fate <UNK> after he is held in jail for what was described as thought crimes against the <UNK> will through a series of <UNK> emotional scenes <UNK> gets us familiar with the man his loyal wife and two daughters as well as three side <UNK> man's pretty young sister a bumbling ex student and a <UNK> of an uncle ¬ñ all come to help the family cope with their plight in the absence of the man of the house br br the story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace and <UNK> occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict this of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally <UNK> by any dramatic event br br in other words although you learn to love the family and their <UNK> and sympathize with their unfortunate situation you get so <UNK> by the <UNK> of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending br br however two hours into the film don't worry <UNK> provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and <UNK> to tide you along he <UNK> you with what i can only describe as the <UNK> all that you have assumed to be what the story was <UNK> innocent man <UNK> from his faithful wife and daughters ¬ñ now suddenly points to one of the family <UNK> someone you have <UNK> taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate br br at this point something curious happened in the theatre i was in everyone started <UNK> with little or no <UNK> br br my word i <UNK> under my breath it struck me then that <UNK> in the final analysis was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war it was in fact a cunning examination of one common human <UNK> how little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us br br now the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked <UNK> that's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap i guess with <UNK> i believe <UNK> <UNK> knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity a wicked old trick he so <UNK> applied in the <UNK> san series and later in <UNK> <UNK> br br after <UNK> the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema br br this to me is the most effective cinematic tool of all one which avoids <UNK> but affects you deeply and proof of its <UNK> was a thousand wet pieces of <UNK> thrown into a <UNK> bin just outside of that thousand <UNK> cinema hall br br now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about human emotions pure and simple
<START> i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie for some reason it <UNK> on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire <UNK> preston i also bought the sound track to this movie very hard to get loved it and hope it will someday come out on <UNK>
<START> this film is just a kids against evil genre thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it but are almost incidental in use the fact that the action takes place on tracy island is just a <UNK> to pull in the public it was interesting to note what the film makers view of future london will be and how the world all fits together br br the best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by lady penelope which are highly comical these provided some light relief for those expecting a <UNK> of the tv series br br having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a <UNK> way and so may just be worth watching
<START> how a director of altman's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a <UNK> a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work a monstrous piece of trash in addition to this <UNK> flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self <UNK> with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer very unusual for mr altman br br patrick watson
<START> this film is a travesty and isn't fit to keep company with the superior original the plot is an absolute mess and the film is way too long <UNK> they're struggling they desperately <UNK> a sentimental reminder from the first film br br <UNK> girl is one of the top 10 british films of all time this one is awful
<START> this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of <UNK> and <UNK> is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that it's your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a <UNK> with special effects <UNK> minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words don't waste your time watching this get the <UNK> tape with john <UNK> as the invisible man instead also starring leonard <UNK> now that was good and <UNK> wells is well served unlike with this mess
<START> i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained i guess it could be called so bad it's good br br as i said the acting is awful i feel like i could have done a better job showing at least any emotion the story is nothing new and has been done better i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival esquire type film i would say rent this or <UNK> it but definitely don't buy it it is not worth more than one watch
<START> <UNK> russell <UNK> a power house performance as <UNK> lord a very wealthy woman with greedy <UNK> with an <UNK> <UNK> type character this actress can never go wrong her very real terror at being in an insane <UNK> is a wonderful piece of acting everyone should watch this
<START> preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical <UNK> stanley <UNK> returns this time <UNK> the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden <UNK> assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered br br film <UNK> <UNK> fun at hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at <UNK> directors who sleep with their actresses looking for a way up the ladder and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian <UNK> who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud <UNK> director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alison played by <UNK> <UNK> seem to be taking over the production andrew <UNK> is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth nelson again <UNK> <UNK> back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to <UNK> a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his way that is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject what motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate quite a hard <UNK> to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slow motion in a <UNK> color and several instances which are captured on video and rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasn't on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious
<START> br br once i ignored some of the <UNK> this was actually a fairly decent horror monster flick so i'll give some of the good points first the dragon was quite convincing especially as she <UNK> through the <UNK> looking for lunch hint she likes humans the action was fairly non stop and after a weak beginning i got quite absorbed in the storyline sorry to say i was kind of rooting for the dragon she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie br br now for the implausible stuff maybe some spoilers if you were hunting a fire breathing dragon in <UNK> ad would you charge into its cave with a barrel of <UNK> under your arm duh a female character with an all american name blonde hair and obvious <UNK> accent trying to pretend she's spanish huh a lead scientist whose <UNK> accent you can cut with a knife and he's supposedly born in chicago educated in usa a military helicopter pilot who does his own <UNK> flies a huge transport <UNK> with no other crew and is an expert <UNK> and combat soldier to boot ok uh huh i won't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while <UNK> with his base br br it's still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the 60's but not by much if we're lucky we won't see dragon fighter 2 though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open or maybe they'll hire a real director next time br br in spite of everything i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes grin
<START> jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before the bad guy plays a <UNK> character from in the line of fire the cops will do anything to find the bad guy and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him all the while he is just trying to turn over a new <UNK>
<START> from the first scene i was really excited i can tell this is going to be awesome i thought the acting was so good i felt as though i was <UNK> dropping on these <UNK> lives the music too was <UNK> unsettling the plot started with a sudden event and then <UNK> forward one could sense toward some <UNK> fate the build was slow but i personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get <UNK> before it's ready to pay off br br so <UNK> going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all i and my movie night companion could say if you understand the director's intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry <UNK> at <UNK> com but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right br br this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case it's too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who don't write or make films you should know that <UNK> a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of <UNK> br br wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but <UNK> i'd take a <UNK> masterpiece any day over an over produced piece of dog poo over <UNK> with too many digital effects like most horror movies these days br br one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing i don't know how to explain it but there was a <UNK> monty python feel about this monster in his more <UNK> monster forms although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie i don't know it still worked for me in some crooked way i will never look at deer <UNK> in the same way again
<START> this short is a <UNK> words fail me here as this is almost <UNK> technically exceptional after more than 90 years the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or <UNK> because it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like <UNK> and <UNK> make your head hurt you may want to skip this recommended
<START> the bourne ultimatum jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the <UNK> spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the <UNK> latest program <UNK> to make super <UNK> like himself br br i was so <UNK> for this one that i watched it's predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspense br br <UNK> boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept it's still brilliant watching him do it it's mind <UNK> to think that two guys with <UNK> and <UNK> can create <UNK> more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in transformers br br <UNK> it up to paul <UNK> who has this <UNK> style of shooting <UNK> a la documentary even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia <UNK> where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe inspiring with various <UNK> used as weapons being a <UNK> a <UNK> book i'll never look at those the same way again and an electric fan don't ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail bite over br br the acting is good and the evolution of julia <UNK> character <UNK> put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with <UNK> but <UNK> which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could <UNK> the cia and <UNK> is something but noticeable moments of <UNK> as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script br br i am reminded of a scene in <UNK> the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean <UNK> character asks james if the <UNK> ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know <UNK> <UNK> and can make weapons out of anything br br <UNK> it's always bothered me that despite being a <UNK> and hunted by the cia <UNK> and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or <UNK> some new <UNK> <UNK> maybe br br if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell it's probably the best action film to come out this year of course you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first it kind of drags a touch near the end but i almost feel tempted to overlook that this is the first 3 movie this summer to at least match if not <UNK> the original and that is saying something br br a
<START> peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to <UNK> in drunken <UNK> the lovely <UNK> york provides a good foil for <UNK> dramatic presence br br the film <UNK> to incest without a single explicit scene but it is able to entertain the viewer in its <UNK> social commentary though this is not major film by any <UNK> it will be remembered for its entertaining performances br br even york <UNK> the papers at the end is a treat to watch <UNK> tragedy <UNK> the possible weakness here is <UNK> laid back direction but the film <UNK> because of the actors and the script br br i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years on both occasions with the name <UNK> love country dance is a rather <UNK> and inappropriate title for this movie wherever it was released as such
<START> this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor human contact with this <UNK> ball burns through flesh like acid it also <UNK> human bodies making it grow bigger nobody believes the teens <UNK> mcqueen and his girlfriend and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci fi and monster movies if you can dig the <UNK> gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from <UNK> as well
<START> this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the <UNK> by <UNK> and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie but for me it failed i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line but if you are looking for a detailed explanation the comment by user <UNK> gives a good description of it br br but it didn't work for me i found it slow which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie in some films one can argue that the filmmakers intended to <UNK> thought and left things ambiguous for that reason i don't think that this is the case here br br as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users i see that they do have a point they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the action and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several <UNK> on board to get through this one
<START> castle of <UNK> aka castle of <UNK> is a well crafted surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson exquisite black and white cinematography flawless dubbing superb casting fairly logical scripting deliberate pacing and a surprise though totally appropriate ending set this one apart only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt love at first <UNK> between elizabeth barbara steele and alan georges <UNK> <UNK> an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie br br while visiting england edgar allan poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to count <UNK> <UNK> the great writer alan a young news reporter <UNK> an interview with poe during the course of the conversation poe reveals that all of his stories are true <UNK> alan expresses his <UNK> about life after death count <UNK> offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in <UNK> castle a night following halloween when the dead walk alan cannot afford the bet so he <UNK> his life for a 10 pound <UNK> br br unlike mario <UNK> <UNK> black sunday ' aka the mask of <UNK> castle of <UNK> is fairly restrained making the few moments of violence even more dreadful especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s br br it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly <UNK> and recorded pan and <UNK> version even so it is well worth seeing and cries out for a modern remake perhaps with christina <UNK> or jennifer love <UNK> in the role of elizabeth watch it and enjoy a film that <UNK> well with robert <UNK> the <UNK>
<START> i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun br br wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlie's angels really that boring i don't seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the <UNK> it wasn't unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasn't that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to <UNK> one is the good girl one is to into her husband all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was dialog that's pretty much it br br not awful not the worst of tv movies but <UNK>
<START> the events of the <UNK> of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in <UNK> montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy <UNK> that we d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing entertainment was more or less <UNK> to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we <UNK> seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad <UNK> unlike the very <UNK> david <UNK> from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9 11 was haunting and <UNK> br br as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed <UNK> of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind <UNK> picked up most of the major <UNK> except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new <UNK> but went to an an all american nice guy instead the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to <UNK> were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor both correct calls
<START> blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasn't that good first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s also blank check won't be remembered in the <UNK> either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by <UNK> films i wouldn't call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6 blank check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original everything just makes you go what haven't i seen this before blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from <UNK> rich to home alone which strangely enough both have <UNK> culkin in it blank check isn't a bad movie but it deserves to fade into obscurity

<START> cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael <UNK> at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his <UNK> best a <UNK> to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out
<START> this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie say it is why first is the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront as one of the plot elements the issue of domestic violence so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points second without the plot element of <UNK> movie relationship with his abusive father the musical climax wouldn't work as well as it does so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have once again missed one of the points specifically why it is so good because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective third give this movie a break for first time movie producers and director this is just not that bad there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people and last the reviewers who say that the music is good have also missed the point check out the range of <UNK> musical <UNK> the variety the <UNK> and the stage performance of prince truly one of a kind going <UNK> where no one else was going during the 1980's and with a style seen in the work of other artists clothes and movement which <UNK> elements came first michael jackson's or <UNK> also see if you can spot the <UNK> fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie long before quentin <UNK> pulp fiction as the sum of its parts not a bad movie at all
<START> i'm not sure how i missed this one when it first came out but i am glad to have finally seen it br br this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of <UNK> japan it tells the tale of prostitution <UNK> systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan br br it is uniquely <UNK> kurosawa even though he died before he could direct this movie his adaptation of the screenplay shows his view of the japanese world and <UNK> system is renowned and <UNK> light upon how these systems interact with each other the characters may <UNK> around each other but the <UNK> system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in the samurai warrior who <UNK> into the good hearted and loving <UNK> world goes back to his life while she <UNK> on a another road with a man who is part of her <UNK> system lowest of the low many prize the world of the samurai above all others but yet it is the lower <UNK> inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one while the <UNK> lovers prove to be the honorable ones br br the movie deserves a higher rating it is a tale of survival of women in <UNK> japan during this time frame men were thought to be the survivors the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival and how their strength <UNK> the japanese culture to continue on as it has br br i recommend the sea is watching to anyone who is a fan of <UNK> kurosawa and even if they're not a fan it is a lovely quiet and soul <UNK> movie and one to be <UNK> for any movie collection

<START> welcome to <UNK> offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory watching this comedy directed by the brothers anthony and joe russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past but since we missed the opening credits we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of was the 1958 italian film big deal on madonna street directed by mario <UNK> br br the russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film anything with william h macy luis <UNK> sam <UNK> patricia <UNK> the late michael <UNK> in it can't be bad since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine br br the film presents us a group of inane would be safe <UNK> from hell no one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they <UNK> whatever could go wrong and more is what they succeed in doing george clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen <UNK> a <UNK> only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of <UNK> funeral br br the best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax and let all these small time crooks do their thing let their funny lines make you laugh as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end
<START> this movie was on british tv last night and is wonderful strong women great music most of the time and just makes you think we do have stereotypes of what older people ought to do and there are fantastic cameos of the sensible but worried children getting near to my best movie ever
<START> having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the <UNK> village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland <UNK> last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe <UNK> in this flick i was most <UNK> by william h macy as crook <UNK> and michael <UNK> as <UNK> they keep you in <UNK> i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
<START> this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see terrible terrible terrible any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker the filmmakers family or a friend of the filmmaker how does this film suck let us count the ways br br the plot incoherent dialogue atrocious i will not slam the effects gore as i understand that this is low budget but was there even one zombie that was not <UNK> c'mon and for a film set in <UNK> island why did that truck sport a <UNK> plate continuity find some br br the girl dancing while the soldier stands at attention please don't put your ex girlfriend or <UNK> sister in your movie naked this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover next time you decide to make a movie don't
<START> a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the 90's which developed the fascinating title character played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however this one off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a <UNK> show returns after a long <UNK> <UNK> isn't really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems <UNK> almost bored the ex <UNK> story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on <UNK> family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two hour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90's which is far far superior
<START> not your typical <UNK> story not <UNK> <UNK> or anne rice here a truly original <UNK> story these <UNK> are genetic mutants who the <UNK> don't bother they are pure evil to br br the film is not perfect many of the actors are clearly amateurs the two leads who play van <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> chick are pretty good though the film is intensely violent which may <UNK> some people also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution
<START> george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't but this show is a work of art it's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it and jokes that re memorable at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an <UNK> teenager i don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job if they had just continued the show i'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good traditional comedy then george lopez is the show for you the one bad thing is the title george lopez really imagine the fresh prince of <UNK> air being will smith c'mon man but otherwise this show is genius 10 10
<START> an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's audiences must've been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle quite a contrast from his public enemy 2 years earlier cagney does add spark interest to a rather routine tired out <UNK> storyline plot but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back first with the conservative honeymoon hotel number then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling by a <UNK> sequence followed by the closing shanghai <UNK> sequence cagney only <UNK> in the last number <UNK> it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler the shanghai <UNK> number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a <UNK> anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind <UNK> by a <UNK> choreography if i was the director i would've inserted the shanghai <UNK> number in the middle close with by a <UNK> which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak in my view the best of the 3 numbers the 3 production numbers are the <UNK> on the cake james <UNK> performance is added decoration to the cake an outstanding musical achievement a 4 star movie the ultimate musical well worth watching you won't be disappointed
<START> the reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist robert james <UNK> also author of bridges of madison county the writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible a failing <UNK> <UNK> american writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is <UNK> swept up by a strong self directed criminal and after a few adventures mostly <UNK> violent <UNK> with scenes that show the <UNK> side of the assassin she leaves the <UNK> partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before nothing can help this movie succeed not even the <UNK> face of scott glenn as the killer not the appealing <UNK> of giovanna <UNK> as <UNK> and not even the <UNK> performance of harvey keitel as the cia <UNK> assigned to track the killer down a serious waste of time
<START> for the most part on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen and already have an opinion on it was either this or <UNK> i like mark <UNK> movies which i haven't seen and i was actually in a movie watching mood which doesn't happen often anymore because i've already watched all the movies i own a million times and that's a lot of movies and i don't have much interest in new movies and boy this movie made me regret it i'm not going to put in any spoilers i'm just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half way decent i think the main girl the dead one who kills everyone is very annoying looking but convincing i'd take her for psycho bitch <UNK> so she fits her roll well though it is lame the blood isn't that great only a few of the kills or may i say <UNK> are alright but you don't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the <UNK> look more convincing towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off and being a band member the <UNK> parts weren't very interesting either though what happened would truly happen when going about recording i'm done if you want to watch this suit yourself
<START> just came out of a sneak preview for this film it had me laughing every 30 <UNK> the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke there are definitely some <UNK> but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron <UNK> in their movies paul rudd is hilarious as always i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like p s i think that seth <UNK> should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac however if you're easily offended don't see this movie if you're a <UNK> feminist don't see this movie and please not matter what even if you think you're one of those hip parents don't take your kids to this movie sure you should let your teens go see this movie just don't watch it with them it would make for some incredibly awkward moments
<START> the subject this latest <UNK> turned <UNK> tries to tackle in his debut ad venture is quite an age old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard timeless romance pun intended br br however the exploration and exploitation for <UNK> <UNK> falls woefully short as the usual <UNK> to <UNK> spice and <UNK> up the usual <UNK> mix of b g score dialog dance drama etc creates a nice looking package with not much inside br br in the first 40 minutes of the movie the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8 9 times further repeats follow thru out the movie after all the lead character's a cook but <UNK> lies les <UNK> no story <UNK> no wonder someone forgot to write a script br br amitabh puts in a <UNK> <UNK> more amount of over acting really when is this guy ever gonna stop how many 60 somethings <UNK> around like that even when <UNK> by a <UNK> 30 something timeless mind yes but surely what about the not so <UNK> <UNK> and sole sorry soul reasonably good acting by <UNK> <UNK> who has the only sensible role in the film the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new <UNK> discovery of a hot new idea nowhere are we presented with any real life problems or issues such a pair might face other than actually getting married which is only the initial <UNK> the sub plot of a little kid with cancer the bachelor boy's first love goes nowhere and whatever little bit of <UNK> this otherwise insipid presentation would have <UNK> is quickly killed off along with the girl's character br br anyway nice try but not quite there yet

<START> contrary to what those who hate christianity the 700 club provides real answers as well as inspiration it also provides reliable news logical commentary and a different view than what abc cbs nbc and <UNK> thinks is best unlike other programs which provide social and faith related commentary those who are behind the 700 club provide help for those in need such as feeding the hungry with operation <UNK> providing medical help to those living in poverty stricken <UNK> and giving hope to those who need hope it's not at all hateful if the 700 club <UNK> you i suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel on your tv set i do the same thing when i find <UNK> <UNK> news or for that matter programs which i find biased or offensive what i find offensive is the way that the abc family <UNK> the <UNK> that the views of the 700 club do not reflect those of abc family
<START> the plot was predictable and fighting with guns gets old but this is a <UNK> movie to look at if you have a low iq and don't really care about real movies i would <UNK> in true art movies like <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal it has this <UNK> <UNK> that is rarely captured on film it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future very natural acting for such young ones i don't know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good but no the less excellent bill scored as far as i'm concerned and for the comment by <UNK> about mr <UNK> bad acting what can one do in that role he played the part rather well in my opinion this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good the ethan hawke version wow do not listen to his comments great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable if that's what you want cinematography gets an above the average rating also
<START> this is a very strange hk film in many ways first many of the action sequences really aren't that much fun the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly that's not to say there aren't some great action scenes but most simply don't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen the opposite side is that this film actually has characters not just people all of the main characters are interesting except for the head bad guy who is flat as a <UNK> table and most are fairly well acted all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch the dialogue is quite witty and doesn't seem to lose much in translation this film is worth seeing but i hope that <UNK> american audiences don't think this is the best hk has to offer
<START> i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix <UNK> and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a rip off of the big chill but with the all star cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a rip off almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old place cabin camp <UNK> williams meg <UNK> jerk <UNK> matt craven jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why i'm even watching these people there was <UNK> character development for me to find any interest in them how did <UNK> lou even find these characters after 20 years plus it wasn't even funny except when <UNK> fell <UNK> <UNK> out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film are you sleeping over there she <UNK> no i'm still thinking no none i can think of
<START> i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning while waiting for my <UNK> how ironic mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin <UNK> title music again i ended up sitting through about the first half hour <UNK> by how wonderfully assured the direction writing and performances are the movie is like a who's who of 50s british character stars cecil parker michael <UNK> miles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and particularly ernest <UNK> great as the <UNK> old giant of the <UNK> mills not to mention alec guinness and joan <UNK> not character players as such but charming charismatic leads this is science fiction in its <UNK> form and <UNK> comedy as well an all time classic and i hope no one ever tries to remake it
<START> i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a 5 i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer <UNK> on tv for several months made me <UNK> want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on <UNK> on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film br br the storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is <UNK> unsuspecting people on the subway there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going what's happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around <UNK> <UNK> the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable oh no it's dark look out behind you i say quite bored with the cheap thrills br br the plot even though predictable was intriguing that is until the end this was good until the end then it just got silly says jack <UNK> <UNK> on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilers br br see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with <UNK> no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how unrealistic how dull br br 3 10 come on <UNK> you've had amazing films but this one sunk
<START> take this movie for what it is not a remake but a completely different approach to the same concept it's not an epic like the original it's more of a popcorn thriller visually it's incredible everything else was just ok br br for what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b c of this movie it wasn't supposed to be a remake and it's not br br the ending was cool i took it as a parallel universe
<START> night of the <UNK> starts as the world <UNK> for a once in a lifetime event the passing of a <UNK> million plus year old <UNK> instead of watching the light show <UNK> <UNK> catherine mary stewart decides to spend the night with cinema <UNK> larry <UNK> michael <UNK> in his booth they awake the next morning as larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked killed by a zombie the same zombie attacks <UNK> but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister samantha <UNK> <UNK> they desperately search for more survivors meet up with a long distance <UNK> named hector <UNK> robert <UNK> meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust they're on the look out for unwilling <UNK> br br written directed by <UNK> <UNK> i found night of the <UNK> a pretty rubbish viewing experience i'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on imdb about it because i just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential the script starts off 100 miles an hour with the <UNK> of the entire population of earth a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course there are plot holes too if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments killing them just seemed a totally bizarre an almost <UNK> thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure it just doesn't make sense i mean if your going to die you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six <UNK> providing blood or just two i'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived <UNK> of each other i mean what are the odds on that when hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took <UNK> before she committed suicide so how did hector know these things i also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a <UNK> pace became incredibly boring dull to watch after hearing so many good things about it night of the <UNK> comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap br br director <UNK> does a really good job i liked the look of the film with it's red <UNK> sky he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets there are constant <UNK> of empty streets deserted roads abandoned buildings it gets extremely repetitive dull ok we get it there's no one else about so there's no need to keep <UNK> it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them the zombies are totally wasted there are two zombie attacks in the entire film that's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes night of the <UNK> pays homage or rips off <UNK> you prefer several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from dawn of the dead 1978 forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any br br technically night of the <UNK> is pretty good the special effects are decent enough the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off the acting was alright expect for <UNK> as samantha the air head blonde who became highly irritating br br night of the <UNK> was a big disappointment for me i had hoped for so much more <UNK> i found this film dull boring <UNK> the <UNK> inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of <UNK> just wanna have <UNK> is probably the worst moment in the film really bad i just don't get why so many people like this i'm sure i'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin i can take it
<START> <UNK> another lifetime movie but once again isn't exactly the worst movie in the world but far from the best i think the main problem is that it's pretty obvious who is responsible for what and it's generally fairly predictable worse yet some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing and the viewer is left wondering okay how much am i supposed to care one thing i did like is that the movie goes to show you that it's never that simple as the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad and sometimes it is evil vs evil rather than good vs evil hadley didn't do what she did out of a sense of justice she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family and to eliminate the competition as for alicia it simply proves that a victim isn't always a good person some of them really do have it coming even if it was a painful horrible death the burning bed is a great example of this but the difference is that the vile man in the burning bed got exactly what he deserved but did alicia have it coming some will say that she did but others don't agree and the law generally doesn't either br br as for acting it's a mixed bag some do a good job like <UNK> but others just came across as indifferent to their roles they were mostly wooden or simply not convincing the music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy especially if you like girl girl action the movie isn't badly shot at all but given its glaring weaknesses the strengths are in background unfortunately br br i've heard rumors of a sequel but given the years i doubt it'll happen but i wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared if alicia is as evil conniving and horrible as people say then i don't think she'll be thinking <UNK> i woke up from a coma oh hadley was responsible oh that's okay i totally forgive her and want the charges dropped no way hadley would be in jail for long anyway if she even does any time since no murder actually happened br br anyway worth checking out at least once
<START> i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing this film wasn't worth the <UNK> dvd r it was burned on i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle <UNK> stealing their parents' camcorder this is by far the worst movie ever made i truly from the bottom of my heart want to sue aaron <UNK> for the two hours he stole from my life br br so apparently it's supposed to be bad on purpose however if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90 minute <UNK> of doo doo you'll see that <UNK> is really trying hard to make an awesome flick the actors attempt dramatic kick ass performances comparable to <UNK> tide but come closer to the marine br br the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg the camera angles are awful the story is c movie at best the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b movie caliber the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else <UNK> has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually <UNK> flies plus the <UNK> score is annoying not because it's <UNK> but because it's non stop that's right the music plays in the background the whole time acting as a <UNK> reminder of how bad this thing is i don't care what the <UNK> claims i don't buy it <UNK> was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself way too serious for what it was a joke br br this film was very low budget but that is no excuse for its record setting suck factor great films are born of substance not budget <UNK> had neither br br allow me to further <UNK> the overwhelming power of this 90 minute waste of time if i were having a three way with jessica alba and jessica <UNK> in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on i'd be out of there <UNK> than steven seagal in executive decision br br undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie two maybe three they'll say it's <UNK> chop <UNK> or cheesy in a good way or it's so bad it's good those people are idiots a movie is either good or it's bad there's no such thing as a good bad movie but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies don't get me wrong there are lots of <UNK> not to be taken seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining <UNK> is one <UNK> is not br br this <UNK> runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long the best thing about this film is the dvd cover so next time you're near the wal mart dvd bargain bin take a look at it don't touch it just look and quietly walk away
<START> i found this movie in the <UNK> section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romero's <UNK> trilogy to <UNK> days later ' however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really is br br it is actually a music video that goes <UNK> faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some half way <UNK> staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe you're dvd player accidentally <UNK> back 3 minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie it's a pity i think anyone could find a better use for 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> though some of the <UNK> effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different character br br also what is <UNK> annoying is the <UNK> on of footage from the <UNK> game i've played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh that's right this isn't a movie but a music video and it's a poor one at that 3 10 br br rated r a lot of violence gore and profanity
<START> the first 30 minutes of <UNK> had my finger <UNK> on the remote <UNK> to flick around to watch something else the premise of two writers down on their luck living in a self <UNK> space bin was mildly amusing but painfully bland br br the introduction of the character played by joe <UNK> the big deal movie guy that lives in the park and sleeps in a <UNK> offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes and then a few more until <UNK> <UNK> introduction as a budding film director borderline <UNK> added a bit of spice her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye candy inclusion br br ultimately the obvious low budget <UNK> on the film with poorly shot scenes <UNK> pace and slapstick handling of certain moments some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget <UNK> i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream but down on their luck br br however for my money the actors save <UNK> from the terrible movie <UNK> and just about <UNK> it into the could have been a cult movie <UNK> i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe <UNK> character in particular the <UNK> scenes in the terribly clich√©d but still funny rich but screwed up characters house where the story <UNK> towards it's final moments br br i can see how <UNK> was a great stage play and while the film makers did their best to translate this to celluloid it simply didn't work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners i think the first 30 minutes <UNK> my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything br br unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket
<START> i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family br br i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a <UNK> of <UNK> br br the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the <UNK> imagination of a child who is facing unknown <UNK> might create br br i found the film to be delightful
<START> the characters at depth less rip offs you've seen all the characters in other movies i promise the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably it throws in some <UNK> meets <UNK> comedy but the jokes are way out of left field completely forced and are <UNK> almost completely after they are <UNK> the hot chick is old and has no personality <UNK> just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between molly the hot chick and kirk the <UNK> love interest is barely <UNK> the attraction in no where to be found its a completely <UNK> relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt <UNK> kiss occurs <UNK> this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super bad esquire movie with a semi appealing plot i could compare this to the <UNK> in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just don't pay to see this movie
<START> if any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills this is probably the one i've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like <UNK> is getting beat up and the same time <UNK> is fighting <UNK> with the police officers the <UNK> <UNK> song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can <UNK> about br br i have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact <UNK> kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after <UNK> and <UNK> she looks pretty in the first half and i've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date <UNK> <UNK> was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him <UNK> naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn't have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances <UNK> kapoor was all right but he didn't have much to do <UNK> khan was wasted in his bad <UNK> type role br br one thing that brought the audience to the theater was <UNK> <UNK> the song <UNK> and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy <UNK> is mad hot however the song <UNK> to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for <UNK> but they won't <UNK> too much about it after <UNK> hum <UNK> <UNK> was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie <UNK> <UNK> was boring and nothing to rave about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see
<START> lawrence olivier and <UNK> <UNK> did two movies together within two years one is considered one of the great romantic films of all time and the movie that made olivier a great movie star and gave <UNK> her best performance role <UNK> heights the other is this film made in england a year earlier the divorce of lady x is a romantic comedy as <UNK> heights is a romantic tragedy olivier is a lawyer <UNK> logan who is a dynamic <UNK> but is also a total <UNK> one night he <UNK> into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people it is a very <UNK> night the type of <UNK> soup fog that london was known for up until a notorious killer fog in the 1950s and the crowd who'd been attending a party in the hotel need <UNK> the management tries to get logan to allow one or two <UNK> ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms but he refuses but he has not <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> as leslie steele the <UNK> of a high court judge she manages to get into <UNK> rooms and <UNK> him to not only agree to her sleeping there but <UNK> his bed he goes onto the couch much to his <UNK> br br the next day they share a breakfast and in the <UNK> it is evident that despite his <UNK> of women logan finds leslie very attractive but she <UNK> refuses to tell him her name she is determined to learn more about him and she finds his attitude toward women <UNK> in the meantime logan is approached by a wealthy <UNK> ralph richardson as lord mere as a potential client mere suspects his wife lady mere <UNK> barnes of having an affair in fact he tells logan her <UNK> was with her lover in the hotel that logan knows he was in on the night of the fog logan naturally jumps to the conclusion that lady mere was his mysterious roommate that night i will not go into the plot any further except to say that leslie eventually realizes what a mistake logan has made and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women br br the script has the feel of a <UNK> novel but is <UNK> still the performances of olivier <UNK> richardson barnes and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> grandfather are all splendid it shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of <UNK> take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what i mean <UNK> first scene complaining about his weak coffee to his butler <UNK> who tells him off properly they've been used to each other's personalities for years or olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office who is certain there were two lady <UNK> in the office two minutes before there were but <UNK> and barnes left together and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a <UNK> or the <UNK> in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in <UNK> room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man as i said a slight charming comedy but it is very charming
<START> after eight <UNK> films the series had run its course as this last entry demonstrates peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to <UNK> some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the <UNK> character of <UNK> and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a funny british sidekick utterly <UNK> all his efforts here
<START> this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot it's a pity that they left it to a pack of <UNK> monkeys <UNK> <UNK> was surely a good <UNK> but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he can't play he can't talk he can't even move very good on <UNK> without his <UNK> michelle <UNK> is a pretty blonde girl and that's all she obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding <UNK> in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the <UNK> acting teacher because he's even a worse actor than her and that's funny especially considering that she isn't italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud
<START> this first rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen the far country is the only one out of all five stewart mann westerns that is often overlooked stewart yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he had in the five stewart mann westerns jeff <UNK> stewart is <UNK> always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him ironically he does wear a bell on his <UNK> that he will not ride without this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben <UNK> played by walter brennan since <UNK> is the one that gave it to him mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart mann westerns he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners <UNK> and <UNK> and no good but beautiful roman and her hired men they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon mcintire and his <UNK> will hang them since the only way out is through <UNK> which is <UNK> town but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart and or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government what is mcintire there for he is there to cheat <UNK> out of their claims and money people are killed a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and <UNK> <UNK> stewart because he is good with a gun stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed so <UNK> is elected instead a <UNK> is killed because he tries to stand up to one of <UNK> men a purely evil <UNK> fancy <UNK> named <UNK> who carries two guns played by <UNK> <UNK> attempts to arrest <UNK> and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk a man named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stewart and <UNK> start to pull out but are <UNK> by <UNK> men <UNK> is killed and stewart is wounded stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like <UNK> the audience also realizes what stewart must do another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the <UNK> and gannon if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the <UNK> will be killed one by one mercilessly and <UNK> this is where a great scene occurs stewart walks into his cabin he has a <UNK> on his arm for a few seconds his gun in the <UNK> is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door he stares at it for a few seconds he <UNK> the <UNK> away the <UNK> lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help what ends the film is a guns blazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feel good feeling that everything will be alright
<START> watching the first 30 minutes of <UNK> of oblivion gave me high hopes it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy the setup was promising in the <UNK> cecil b demille makes his <UNK> of the ten <UNK> it seems in using real egyptian <UNK> for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don't they always aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of <UNK> it down hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to <UNK> the site the movie's first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci fi channel movie the first <UNK> we get of the <UNK> monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect then the body counts starts this is were the movie went south for me the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do they make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone after getting that vital information do they share it with the <UNK> at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little <UNK> in my step to solve the problem after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the <UNK> monster in the usual way by racing around in <UNK> <UNK> and shooting it with a rocket <UNK> while it's standing by a pile of <UNK> <UNK> for a sci fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn't saying much at all what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it
<START> this movie is witty watchable and utterly touching and now often do you get to see jean harlow or any actress of this era for that matter give another woman a swift punch in the jaw twice br br after <UNK> ruby is sent to a <UNK> after getting mixed up with <UNK> edward hall he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile her <UNK> becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and she's convinced that this <UNK> has abandoned her but in fact her love has <UNK> him and he comes to see her despite the fact that he will be arrested and from the help of a minister are married br br the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable who was her most frequent leading man her cynical character is a perfect match for <UNK> smooth talking crook what's not to like br br you know you wouldn't be a bad looking dame if it wasn't for your face ruby <UNK> remarks to gypsy her rival if you're going to get that close to me i'll have to open the other window br br priceless
<START> it's a testament to <UNK> incredible film making <UNK> that he was able to complete both <UNK> and his stunning masterpiece <UNK> in the same year 1969 and it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public compared to media <UNK> like the great <UNK> kurosawa that both <UNK> and <UNK> have received less than 500 votes between the two of them br br <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> mad dog killer loyal to the <UNK> clan and their boss <UNK> played by another genre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the <UNK> <UNK> the historical backdrop is fairly accurate with <UNK> increasing political turmoil between <UNK> and the <UNK> and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political <UNK> it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> but it's not essential by any means the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the <UNK> as well br br as one would expect from a <UNK> <UNK> film in his golden years the late 60's the visual palette is breathtaking the use of <UNK> and internal symbolism hiding behind <UNK> beauty style however is never <UNK> for <UNK> it is always employed in the service of story br br and speaking of story <UNK> is dominated both literally and <UNK> by the tortured main character <UNK> <UNK> as most <UNK> protagonists <UNK> finds himself in a moral double <UNK> torn between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> natural <UNK> although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his <UNK> is in the first half of the movie <UNK> is trying for social self <UNK> <UNK> aspirations of social rank and marriage with an <UNK> daughter a great progression for someone coming from a <UNK> background in the rigid social <UNK> system of 19th century japan br br the turning point for <UNK> is when he realizes at what cost self <UNK> comes the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self it is at that point that he <UNK> a very symbolic transformation from a famous <UNK> of the <UNK> clan to a <UNK> drifter without past or future <UNK> the <UNK> although not technically <UNK> and not a genre drifter in <UNK> mold it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego ambition and self <UNK> that allows <UNK> to see things as they really are and redeem himself br br <UNK> ends which i won't reveal here in the best way any story can end both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives <UNK> the last laugh a last <UNK> remark in the face of death
<START> i'm a fan of columbo especially on a rainy saturday and it was fun to see <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> but this episode was very lacking the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today but it was amusing to see the crazy couch <UNK> and modern <UNK> equipment and of course the mandatory <UNK> humor <UNK> fun at modern art for sale the high tech home is a <UNK> or disney version of <UNK> and fun to think of writers <UNK> those way out <UNK> br br if its sunny outside go play as there are much better columbo episodes still we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast
<START> despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly <UNK> apart from a clich√©s only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension br br whilst having the overall look of a big budget for <UNK> the feel is decidedly small town <UNK> br br has anyone not seen the brothers http imdb com title <UNK> those who have will pick the similarities <UNK> i've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clich√©d boys talking crap but it comes across as forced br br i believe oscar <UNK> sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious br br those who have any doubts left at all that <UNK> living in <UNK> culture has been deeply hopefully not <UNK> affected by american speech culture and everything <UNK> will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> always looks good on screen but is let down by the script br br it always <UNK> me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good <UNK> at the clich√©d punchline see the wanna be white boy br br i know someone who found this movie hilarious however that person has the brains of a <UNK> and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars br br that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick ok but not great fun but not funny wake up <UNK> this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt reviews br br my advice if you watch it get drunk first
<START> the trailers for this film were better than the movie what waste of talent and money wish i would've waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldn't be out 9 the movie totally misses the mark what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a b movie at best movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didn't in this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and <UNK> in film and this film offered neither the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it lot of hype for nothing i was very disappointed in this film and i'm telling everyone not to see it the cheesy <UNK> music throughout made the film worse as well and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film what a disappointment
<START> lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show <UNK> a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is <UNK> br br the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about <UNK> diving from someone who appeared to be a <UNK> pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era the <UNK> of american television
<START> possible spoilers re late appearing cameos br br seldom does one see so many fine memorable character actors almost entirely actresses to be precise in one film even though a few only appear for cameos each one is a gem the british do this mix of comedy and real life pathos better than anyone imo so it is no surprise that most of the actors are brits br br the music is great no doubt much had to be dubbed does leslie caron really play the bass so well maybe who knew but <UNK> lane was <UNK> herself her warm visceral sound still turns my <UNK> like few other jazz singers br br as an aging musician myself not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course it was a <UNK> film as well a great film for anyone whose wondering if they're past it in their profession or <UNK> whatever it may be and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage br br i missed a little of the opening but a <UNK> 9 10 and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing
<START> is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays br br no and here's why br br in <UNK> <UNK> the sale that bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager nelson is <UNK> him to a new department <UNK> naturally bugs objects and the fun begins br br using nearly every department in the store children's wear sports shoes costumes women's <UNK> don't ask bugs comes out on top at every turn even referring to the manager as the great <UNK> even when trapped in the confines of an elevator bugs makes the best of the situation br br director jones is on top of his <UNK> game as always as are <UNK> as bugs <UNK> and nelson the manager who does sound like radio <UNK> <UNK> go ask your grand parents br br and a <UNK> word of advice when confronted by a fuzzy looking woman wanting to try on bathroom <UNK> always check her ears br br ten stars for <UNK> <UNK> the best argument yet for animal labor laws
<START> this movie really rocks jeff <UNK> is terrific in the film his fighting incredible he is such a fast martial artist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was very good mission of justice is an action packed movie that is never boring if you like fighting movies with incredible non stop action then check out mission of justice today
<START> i agree with the other comments i saw this movie years ago christopher plummer is hilarious as a dandy the <UNK> is <UNK> if this comes out on video i will definitely buy it
<START> i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking <UNK> i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud <UNK> and a hot chick in shiny black leather <UNK> a big <UNK> bike <UNK> dig loud <UNK> and hot chicks in shiny black leather <UNK> big <UNK> <UNK> right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic <UNK> tedious dull dumb <UNK> <UNK> barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe <UNK> likes it in fact
<START> could anyone please stop john carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation how low can you go it seems this man has lost any self respect br br this episode looks like it has been done by a film student it isn't even worth beginning to talk about what was bad because it was just a <UNK> directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation br br come on mr carpenter please <UNK> immediately with a rest of self <UNK> and stop <UNK> out trash like this in a bad tradition from escape from l a to ghosts of mars br br get drunk instead
<START> i happened on shower in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy i then <UNK> into a copy to purchase at <UNK> price and am happy for my luck shower is the story of three 3 men a father and two 2 adult sons each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern china as with many foreign films the chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting <UNK> of this movie br br beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local chinese color giving the setting to this story is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story all set against the backdrop of a village <UNK> br br the family's story moves from <UNK> to understanding and made me glad i came to know these people added to the main story are the numerous small characters <UNK> customers and their individual conflicts and friendships shower is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity
<START> oliver <UNK> is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen <UNK> in what he called a pretty good sci fi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves <UNK> through the <UNK> drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences <UNK> loves to kick and kick and kick and kick haha br br <UNK> character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps <UNK> his family instead of joining up <UNK> tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy <UNK> plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or <UNK> them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these <UNK> br br the plot was very cheesy and easy to think of <UNK> is probably not very well known because of his script choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the <UNK> crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against <UNK> character the music was typical action music <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which actually wasn't as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment br br ultimately i gave it a 4 10 because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver <UNK> to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
<START> <UNK> of the bliss theme is merely the latest in a <UNK> <UNK> of bad to average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema going set for the record this list all of the films on which appear to be attempting a castle <UNK> miracle includes strange <UNK> <UNK> bad eggs the <UNK> <UNK> norman <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> the only one to have worked has been <UNK> br br here the performances never <UNK> as john howard doesn't even look like he's in the right film ¬ñ though perhaps that was the intention as franklin plays sleepy conservative <UNK> against its more interesting inhabitants 20 year old <UNK> who live with their parents are becoming <UNK> on screen but this is hardly a reason to watch the film in fact the only reasons may well be 1 <UNK> bizarre ¬ñ but quite fun ¬ñ performance and 2 the <UNK> <UNK> theme which has run through <UNK> strange <UNK> tom white <UNK> project danny <UNK> the rage in <UNK> lake traveling light <UNK> <UNK> swimming <UNK> and <UNK> many of which are very good excellent enter at own risk may be one for people who <UNK> at the word <UNK> 4 10
<START> somehow they summed up the 60's ten years that <UNK> changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they <UNK> the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy go lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country and the second family was such a non factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other <UNK> leave that to <UNK> and the history channel
<START> i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine <UNK> role compared to sharon stone madonna is too coarse and <UNK> she's not even close br br evil <UNK> sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth the <UNK> effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding however she <UNK> treats us to a frightening <UNK> of evil beyond redemption in the obligatory sex scene she projects pure <UNK> lust especially her <UNK> <UNK> eyes and a face flat with pleasure thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques the harsh lines of age are only occasionally <UNK> rather she seems to have a slight golden glow yes <UNK> br br the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual <UNK> the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed i wouldn't have had a chance br br the original basic instinct attempts at censorship i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film set in san francisco a beautiful city worthy of this film it is outstanding from the music to the locations to the sets and so on paul <UNK> pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew br br that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the <UNK> of bay area gay and lesbian <UNK> groups attempts at censorship were <UNK> denied <UNK> these philosophical <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> control over the script <UNK> on re writes that would promote their political and <UNK> driven <UNK> example <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they <UNK> that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy br br on locations in san francisco the gentle <UNK> <UNK> did their best to <UNK> filming of the scenes with noise flashing lights and other tactics the executive producers mario <UNK> and andrew <UNK> <UNK> to fight any efforts to <UNK> the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and <UNK> <UNK> orders against the <UNK> tactics br br <UNK> thanks to the <UNK> <UNK> the film got huge national press coverage millions of dollars worth of free advertising their calls for viewers to <UNK> the film resulted in a <UNK> that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched it also received <UNK> critical acclaim it was in the words of the <UNK> <UNK> in network a big <UNK> hit sorry gentle reader i just couldn't resist that one yes it's a <UNK> br br in conclusion i believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2 with their brilliant musical scores <UNK> and acting are works of art br br that deserve protection under our <UNK>
<START> after reading the other reviews for this film i am of the opinion that the high <UNK> are probably paid studio <UNK> as the film i saw was absolutely dire with wooden acting <UNK> scripting and plodding predictable directing one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping <UNK> and dramatic <UNK> and wide open <UNK> sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be <UNK> on dvd is best to avoid
<START> ok first of all i am a huge zombie movie fan i loved all of romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re make of dawn of the dead so when i had heard every single critic <UNK> this movie i was still optimistic i mean critics hated resident evil and while it may not be a particularly great film i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot em up with a half decent plot this however is pure crap terrible dialogue half <UNK> plot and video game scenes inserted into the film who in their right mind thought that was a good idea the only thing about this movie i use the term loosely that i enjoyed was <UNK> <UNK> as captain kirk ugh while his name throws originality out the window you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it everyone else acts as if they're doing shakespeare and very badly i might add basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b like to play mst3k the home game see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs br br
<START> i stopped short of giving mr blandings builds his dream house 10 10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> but other than that the movie's a hoot portraying middle class new york couple jim cary grant and muriel blandings myrna loy trying to build a house in <UNK> this flick has something for everyone br br grant is his usual <UNK> self while loy does quite well as merely a wife but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as <UNK> and <UNK> lawyer bill cole who seems to have more plans than he's making clear as for the house itself throughout most of the movie you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there the <UNK> <UNK> and others also provide their fair share of laughs br br all in all a comedy classic also starring louise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> connie marshall and jason <UNK> sr
<START> only seen season 1 so far but this is just great a wide variety of people stuck on a island nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of <UNK> in their <UNK> it sounds like <UNK> place meets the <UNK> family and why is that so great it probably is not but then ad a <UNK> full of x files a dose of what and a big hey and a island that is everything you ever <UNK> of in your <UNK> nightmares and you'll be lost to the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable great set up solid acting with a <UNK> acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human well almost everybody i think with good and bad sides but weird oh so weird
<START> as big as a texas <UNK> and equally as boring even liz taylor james dean chill <UNK> and dennis hopper can't <UNK> this <UNK> boat taylor actually looks bad wrong wardrobe wrong hair and wrong makeup a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career hopper gives the only believable performance and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don't remember him for a comic actor rock hudson is his usual prototype of <UNK> doll ken and makes one wonder what a say redford could have done with the male lead there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes just a <UNK> of <UNK> that have little relationship to each other except for hopper there is no character development only a collection of cardboard <UNK> that pop up <UNK> for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery to its credit the film does tackle racism and <UNK> at a time when they were taboo subjects and it does have size making it an excellent choice for <UNK> yourself of <UNK> house guests those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second <UNK> you won't be missing anything of interest
<START> stumbling upon this hbo special late one night i was absolutely taken by this attractive british executive <UNK> i have never laughed so hard over european history or any of the other completely worthwhile point eddie izzard made i laughed so much that i woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house
<START> this is a complete <UNK> br br the movie clearly has been shot in north western indian state of <UNK> look at the chase scene the vehicles are indian the writing all over is hindi language used in india the drive through is on typical <UNK> streets also the palace is in <UNK> about 10 miles from <UNK> <UNK> the film makers in their about the film in dvd bonus seem to make it sound that they <UNK> their lives shooting in <UNK> and around almost all of their action scenes are shot in india the scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to <UNK> folk song they just recorded the <UNK> folk song how do i know it because i have traveled that area <UNK> they are just on the band <UNK> to make big on the issue i do challenge the film makers to deny it
<START> david and <UNK> is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by <UNK> f <UNK> directed by henry king and starring gregory peck king david susan <UNK> <UNK> raymond massey nathan <UNK> moore <UNK> and <UNK> meadows <UNK> br br the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible it follows king david who as a child had <UNK> the giant <UNK> and now we find him in <UNK> as the second king of israel a tough and assured king david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems for once he spies <UNK> taking a shower re bath it 's the start of a journey <UNK> adultery and betrayal a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon br br typically for the genre david <UNK> is a large <UNK> production from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography leon <UNK> it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values <UNK> tho the film is <UNK> paced and relies on 99 of its worth being driven purely by dialogue this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some <UNK> to go with their <UNK> this is a very <UNK> picture in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here it's a biblical love story <UNK> with sins of the heart but that is no bad thing at all because breaking it down we find it's very well acted peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well <UNK> is pushing it to the max and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing the character flow is never interrupted as phillip <UNK> the ghost and mrs <UNK> oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout br br sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical swords <UNK> genres most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres 7 10
<START> jim <UNK> has made one of the best films you will see all year the quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go there is not one false note in the entire film not one everything works the hand held camera is never distracting and always where it should be the three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real there isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role these are just real girls trying to find themselves there is no political agenda hidden or otherwise this is cinema at its most basic and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie goers it deserves a much wider release a special hats off to hugh <UNK> for providing the film makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made i can't wait to see what mr <UNK> does next
<START> if there is one film which is the worst of this year it's tashan the first <UNK> gave an indication that the film will be a boring <UNK> 2 style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a <UNK> film or maybe seeing the cheesy <UNK> but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then <UNK> 2 and what i expected first <UNK> introduction which is boring then saif kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film what kinda role it is what acting is he doing his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance <UNK> of childish <UNK> style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have got 3 films more to direct if this film had worked thats the <UNK> of <UNK> only money nothing else so <UNK> is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music <UNK> <UNK> is ordinary br br performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a <UNK> of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor <UNK> outrageously and <UNK> the show even more rest are okay
<START> for me this is ealing <UNK> most perfect film as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released br br as a satire on economic notions of <UNK> and the commercial need for in built <UNK> it could <UNK> be more up to the minute and of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot br br oddly there are parallels with jurassic park in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you but spielberg <UNK> away from the <UNK> brilliant central <UNK> to <UNK> on some nonsense about <UNK> hmmm br br in the man in the white suit alec <UNK> plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out suddenly workers and capital at the northern english mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their <UNK> br br of course being ealing it's a comedy but it <UNK> have been the complex interplay of <UNK> should that be suited interests plays out beautifully as one by one all parties realize that <UNK> is a threat and that <UNK> and waste are what keep the <UNK> turning br br but yes this is a comedy albeit a pointed one and amid the political <UNK> are delicious performances and some good old fashioned knock about laughs br br nonetheless it's the biting satire that <UNK> dazzling and white
<START> i have seen just about all of miyazaki's films and they are all beautiful and captivating but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed me br br i fell in love with <UNK> and <UNK> and their sweet caring friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the shining point in this movie they are so well developed and full of personality br br now let me <UNK> i'm really talking about the japanese version of the movie with english <UNK> while the english dub is good mostly it simply <UNK> in comparison to the original language version the voices are better the dialogue everything so i suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was
<START> the only thing that kept me from <UNK> after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the tv show this is also the main reason that fans of the tv show won't like the movie but not the only reason this movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root <UNK> it approaches the <UNK> depths of bad movie making and then gets even worse i won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail suffice it to say that i pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c p the first time
<START> if you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation oh well but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic you will love it jim carey was incredible as usual the story line was great a few parts added like the history of the grinch made it even better ron howard never misses a beat but although there were a few adult comments and <UNK> added this is <UNK> to be a kids or family show try not to lose sight of that if you do you really wont enjoy the movie and as for the comments about ron howard try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do its not easy as it looks
<START> this low budget b <UNK> plot comes with all the <UNK> mad scientist complete with sidekick <UNK> corporate greed of <UNK> industry eccentric and extreme genetic <UNK> and information technology can't leave that out br br start with strange sequence of hot looking <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> decide to take a <UNK> in the waters near an <UNK> island and end up <UNK> for <UNK> hammerhead sharks br br cut to weak back story <UNK> the stock decline of a generic <UNK> corporation which <UNK> its wicked shakespeare <UNK> <UNK> to entertain an un <UNK> offer made by a former employee scientist that was <UNK> out of his job as head of research and who also happens to be a nut of course total herbert west wannabe he is offering up a new <UNK> cell technology that could make tons <UNK> cash or so it seems this <UNK> in several employees to his <UNK> ish island must have been quite an impressive exit package from the company when he was let go for him to afford an island to <UNK> his scientific <UNK> including the <UNK> and co incidentally the ex fianc√© of the mad <UNK> son now <UNK> <UNK> how convenient br br the plan sort of is to <UNK> lost love between the former <UNK> while <UNK> revenge on the former colleagues for his <UNK> <UNK> how can this guy be bitter he has his own <UNK> island after all br br soon everyone is on the run from endless supply of security guards <UNK> heavy <UNK> from mutant plants ¬ñ can there be an <UNK> island without man eating plants from <UNK> son's <UNK> for carnage from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plans and from lack of a cell phone <UNK> and they all must learn to work together to get off the island alive br br will anyone escape will a new species be created watch it and find out br br there is some entertainment value in this movie but don't expect much for the true combs fan this is not to be missed br br don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the stranger jack matthew <UNK> arrives in the studio of the crook collector of <UNK> max vincent <UNK> and tells his ambitious companion and <UNK> in <UNK> jamie <UNK> <UNK> that he is jack's brother jamie does not buy his story <UNK> jack and ties him up to a chair when max arrives jack <UNK> us 100 000 00 for each one to protect him in a <UNK> of the <UNK> spanish judges with a wealthy and dangerous collector max invites his stupid <UNK> piece mark <UNK> junior who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars to <UNK> the <UNK> team however jack double crosses the collector and then he <UNK> jack jamie and piece br br the low budget spanish judges is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast <UNK> <UNK> is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent <UNK> they are not able to save the stupid story further the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work and actually they are silly and not funny my vote is three br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all for money
<START> this is one of those films that's more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective i do my ratings based on how much i enjoyed or was entertained by the movie so i'm giving it a 4 if i were to rate it as an academic film though it would get a 10 br br it is shot in a very interesting manner like a pseudo silent film with elements of sound effect and reality it's meant to convey disjointed memory and <UNK> of the mind and it is interesting in these respects br br however the film has a lot of disgusting elements to it that i didn't find all that entertaining they're mainly just disturbing it has some very interesting imagery too and some interesting concepts but some of the character relationships especially between the mother and son are pretty disturbing br br in all this film will either appeal to you or it won't for me it was interesting from an academic perspective but it wasn't a good watch and i'll probably not go back to it a second time br br 4 10 if you're looking for entertainment 10 10 from an academic standpoint
<START> this really is one of the worst movies ever made i consider myself a huge zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting lame special effects a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies as long as the film has a good atmosphere story suspension or whatever to offer this one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate maybe worse some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a <UNK> holiday and definitely did a better job no zombie film though br br this flick is not even funny not speaking of anything else really bad and redundant special effects zombies that look like normal people except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces way to much fake blood i like realism a lot the combination of realism and zombie films being <UNK> but the presented gore is just plain silly the camera stays quite long with <UNK> scenes it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder why the zombies use weapons to kill their prey i will not go into the details of the dubbing others have done so although i am from germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version i will not waste more of my time with this movie br br keep away from it as far as you can
<START> this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and <UNK> classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his <UNK> head alive in a <UNK> pan in his basement while he <UNK> town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real <UNK> body with a <UNK> faced <UNK> head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the <UNK> comes out of the closet and rips off the <UNK> remaining good arm his other is not right from a <UNK> earlier failure and the whole place burns down br br the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we <UNK> the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the haunting br br i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i'd rather go to the dentist than watch chicago again br br seven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster
<START> tremendous black and white <UNK> cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedly true life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men br br the story was written by truman capote so you get the very liberal anti death penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case robert blake and scott wilson play the two <UNK> losers who have twisted <UNK> on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family br br despite the annoying <UNK> at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this it makes me wish more modern day films were made in black and white see it on dvd br br blake wilson john forsythe jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 shortly after blake in real life was <UNK> innocent in the murder trial of his wife one can't help but look at blake and this film differently after that
<START> i can't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite <UNK> sexual assault scenes it's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to <UNK> these <UNK> as in the woman who is repeatedly <UNK> and <UNK> never holds the men <UNK> for their actions and neither does anyone else one man is stopped from <UNK> the assault when someone throws a <UNK> at him but he is <UNK> only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually you jerk from a woman's point of view the movie is a let down it sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders but the movie is much more defined by the romance which is <UNK> by the notion that human sexuality must involve an <UNK> of power with men <UNK> the woman they love this amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to <UNK> off her <UNK> she never even makes them apologize rather she seems <UNK> overall a depressing and <UNK> movie with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes but not as good as hero by a long shot
<START> my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain s can t tell who is under that cloth then they are <UNK> br br but in reed hadley s zorro s fighting legion serial 1939 the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really is br br but anyway zorro is one of the best character s in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in the mask of zorro 1998 is a delight br br my interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the serial s of the 30s 40s br br <UNK>
<START> anne <UNK> epic novel the tenant of <UNK> hall should be studied and read throughout schools and <UNK> and peoples living rooms its a fantastic story and tells the real truth on alcoholism and ruined <UNK> and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the <UNK> br br do watch this film its a great version of the book and very moving indeed i'm sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced br br excellent acting and great locations
<START> exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be <UNK> again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was <UNK> in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a <UNK> trash sexy horror flick ' i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg 13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new <UNK> of the <UNK> movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff you'll need it
<START> the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies what with the rise in budgets during the economic <UNK> the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became <UNK> and the general <UNK> optimism of the times while most of these were rip roaring <UNK> about the wild <UNK> and often frankly misogynistic exploits of <UNK> like errol flynn and <UNK> power gunga din is very different in its focus scope and tone br br part of gunga <UNK> secret is the division of <UNK> in its writing team the original story is by ben <UNK> and charles macarthur two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood's golden age however the actual screenplay was the work of joel <UNK> and fred <UNK> both of whom <UNK> especially had a background in comedy what we get from these four is a plot that is well balanced and engaging yet also cleverly <UNK> up with comical touches most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies usually featuring one or two comic relief supporting players but they didn't use laughs in the way gunga din does here all the main characters are capable of being objects or <UNK> of jokes we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly <UNK> as the scene <UNK> into a light hearted <UNK> the first main battle scene is an even handed blend of action and gags in the style of the silent <UNK> of douglas fairbanks sr something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to <UNK> towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot however the <UNK> <UNK> into comedy ¬ñ such as the <UNK> punch routine ¬ñ make this slow portion bearable br br producer director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point this was his first full on action feature and he does a <UNK> good job in particular his use of moving point of view shots make the battle scenes extra <UNK> he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era ¬ñ a sense of real dread and fear he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains <UNK> many of the shots and <UNK> the characters the portrayal of the abandoned village and the <UNK> <UNK> cry of <UNK> is genuinely haunting this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here causing us to worry for these likable characters and making the comedy a greater relief of tension br br a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience we are made aware of din visually as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or <UNK> refer to him because of this we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the <UNK> but he quickly becomes a notable character to us and <UNK> a sympathetic one as we see him <UNK> his life and giving water to dying men br br but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for <UNK> without a capable cast fear not for gunga din has a top notch one victor <UNK> and cary grant were <UNK> suited to the material since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy grant in particular is at his best largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over the top <UNK> and <UNK> that was his trademark douglas fairbanks jr is not quite up to the standard of his <UNK> companions but he is by no means bad and of course there is sam <UNK> cursed by his looks to forever play these <UNK> little <UNK> but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity i have not set out to bash the <UNK> adventures of errol flynn and <UNK> power and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely but gunga din does things that even the best of those <UNK> could never achieve not only does it <UNK> with the dashing male lead or the clich√©d <UNK> damsel it successfully <UNK> the action genre with comedy and <UNK> in a way that few pictures have done before or since and that's fabulous
<START> as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea presented as a series of video <UNK> made by the two troubled men i cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens the months of <UNK> leading to zero day the <UNK> for the day on which they will attack the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer yet focuses on the literal <UNK> the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending as expected but leading up to this point it's never really clear as to why they are planning this out we are told the obligatory story that they were <UNK> but the film also seems to <UNK> this without ruining the film it's easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions but falls short because of sloppy film making all directing is amateur to further the <UNK> video concept but the story and continuity is weak the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot but also fails to provide the information for such an event the ending is abrupt and doesn't feel like it finishes everything that the film began
<START> this true story of <UNK> <UNK> is more of a army training film than anything else obviously thrown together quickly on a <UNK> budget about the only thing it has to recommend it is an early performance by robert mitchum who's the only decent actor in the cast and actual footage of the <UNK> at pearl harbor which gets your blood <UNK> as it was obviously intended to do
<START> the costumes the dialog historical accuracy are terrible for instance <UNK> dash and the hanging scene the <UNK> was accurate as for as i could tell but that type of <UNK> broke the person's neck ms dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot this type of not did not <UNK> the person it killed them at the end of the drop br br and right before they go in to rob a bank in a flashback they pause on the street for a group hug with their <UNK> hiding their faces that would have been obvious to people on the street br br the poor editing that is a <UNK> pack under that shirt and it is obvious the clip of the long ride shows them riding along then <UNK> the film br br i did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap it seemed symbolic the entire movie was crap
<START> so there's this bride you see and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding then get this a year later her former fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful <UNK> and then that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her <UNK> <UNK> be hilarious polite <UNK> br br this i like to <UNK> is how jeff <UNK> the man who <UNK> up over her dead body presented his concept to the studio <UNK> over there at new line cinema the big mystery is how those very same corporate <UNK> could then turn right around and green light the project allowing <UNK> to direct the film as well as write the screenplay br br for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds then clearly you have another think coming the only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no holds <UNK> satirical farce instead wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy <UNK> and <UNK> romantic comedy <UNK> <UNK> in boring half <UNK> every step of the way <UNK> down the absurdity in favor of drab <UNK> indeed over her dead body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly <UNK> thought he was going with it virtually every set up joke and sight gag in the film is flat <UNK> and poorly executed with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their <UNK> how else to explain the <UNK> lifeless performances of paul rudd eva <UNK> parker lake bell and jason <UNK> in their various roles br br i choose not to blame the actors some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past that is particularly the case with rudd but <UNK> and those studio <UNK> sure have some <UNK> to do
<START> i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for last comic standing if they don't have a good agent then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80 of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent if they do make it to an audition i was told that it's pre determined if they get a second chance so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us br br if the comics do make it to the show then most of them don't get imdb credits i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of last comic standing and i don't get paid for doing the <UNK> job it's really a disgrace a month ago i asked last comic standing 7 on <UNK> why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their <UNK> page i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this i just want people to know the truth i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians comedians get exploited on hbo bet <UNK> and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen br br please watch this video of a comedian who was <UNK> http www youtube com watch v <UNK> <UNK> y
<START> this has to be the worst piece of garbage i've seen in a while br br heath ledger is a <UNK> he looked <UNK> i wish i'd known that he and <UNK> <UNK> are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him br br orlando bloom is a <UNK> with the <UNK> beard and deer in the <UNK> look about him i can't say i agree br br rachel <UNK> was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set br br i'm supposed to feel sorry for <UNK> and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite cliche ridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didn't br br the last 10 15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are <UNK> up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that's not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i'll bite <UNK> leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other <UNK> members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was br br i may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasn't free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back
<START> this is surely one of the worst films ever made each scene is painful you will <UNK> at the flimsy attempts at humor the awkward camera work the <UNK> and racism the ridiculous story line the wooden acting poor joan bennett she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment in all dreadful
<START> want a great recipe for failure take a s y plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a horror movie has known let <UNK> for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash the result is corpse <UNK> a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and <UNK> low places br br the movie utterly blew my words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not plan 9 from outer space this is a long boring sad waste of time corpse <UNK> ii is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen i <UNK> me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this <UNK> if you can call it acting but than again when you have poor direction poor <UNK> poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize br br this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you <UNK> to quickly <UNK> out of existence <UNK> that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really with i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not <UNK> the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you ted v <UNK> for giving me new found respect for every movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy or boring
<START> <UNK> al <UNK> best role he plays tony montana a small time hood from cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in miami and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn't <UNK> for nobody starts as doing jobs for a big time cuban dealer frank lopez robert <UNK> and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend <UNK> steven bauer soon he has an eye for the <UNK> sexy wife elvira michelle pfeiffer after frank sees a threat from tony to his position he attempts to assassin tony but with no luck tony is upset and nothing can stop him now the film has a great supporting cast among them is f murray abraham as a <UNK> gangster another familiar face is harris <UNK> as a crooked cop trying to shake down tony marry elizabeth <UNK> as tony's young sister credits to the <UNK> screenplay by oliver stone this film is one of brian <UNK> <UNK> points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented the movie has a magnificent look to it also pay attention for two memorable scenes the one at the fancy restaurant say <UNK> to the bad guy the other is the final shootout where tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 <UNK> that <UNK> to his house this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie i have ever seen for fans of al pacino and crime movies it's a must see for the rest of you it's highly recommended 10 10
<START> this tender beautifully crafted production <UNK> deep down bitter sweet into my being the <UNK> <UNK> the life <UNK> bus driver and the teachers personalities present a <UNK> debate as the story <UNK> the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of <UNK> all the time the <UNK> of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the <UNK> of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting <UNK> the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
<START> this show was great it wasn't just for kids which i thought at first it is for the whole family br br the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son he sadly passed away in season 2 i could believe it when i heard it br br i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made it must of be so hard for them to film this you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy br br season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday secrets br br i still think the show was strong enough to go on i was disappointed that it ended it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends br br it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday
<START> when i first saw the trailer for prom night i have to admit the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a <UNK> film not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people there was no tension the characters how was i supposed to care about them they had no development what so ever the killer oh my god this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed i know it's a film but why would a man who never or at least we know of killed any one before kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over i mean was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her i have no idea because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror br br <UNK> family was just brutally murdered by her teacher who has become very obsessed over her he was captured and put in jail it's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life she's even going to her senior prom but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends and the hotel maid and the bell boy because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these <UNK> are donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so <UNK> just wow br br i'm sorry i really did want to love this movie we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious i know that this was a pg 13 movie but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes not to mention no stab holes i wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen this movie was made for the teenagers not adults and not for those who know a real horror movie no offense to those who did enjoy this film but i don't understand how anyone could br br 2 10
<START> i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world justin timberlake did a good job i wasn't expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job considering it is his first movie he did a good job this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night it should go pretty well the cast was great so i highly recommend that everyone <UNK> this movie out
<START> pickup on south street 1953 directed by movie maverick samuel fuller contains a stunning opening that <UNK> a double <UNK> subway rider candy susan peters <UNK> with <UNK> skip mccoy richard widmark <UNK> in shades of sinatra cool she's unaware that she carries valuable <UNK> mccoy is unaware of <UNK> it both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents thus the <UNK> sets in motion a degree of <UNK> candy is <UNK> watched skip and the police and therefore <UNK> naive skip the <UNK> petty thief is <UNK> unaware <UNK> by federal agents the <UNK> all knowing are ultimately helpless they can't stop the passing of government secrets or the spread of communism
<START> this was a wonderful film how these women tried to save their husbands i thought that the performances of the actors were great i had to think about the film for a very long time i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be i wish i could be so strong as a woman i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie i think you can compare the film with der <UNK> the <UNK> if you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war we should remember something like the war forever
<START> spike lee has been in a decline since his early <UNK> and this mess does nothing to help i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point lee's first movie with an all white cast is a major disappointment br br what's the point that italians swear and like funky sex but not with their wives if i wanted to see scorsese i'd go to a scorsese movie the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype br br i've admired several of lee's films especially do the right thing this movie is a waste of time
<START> a high school principal <UNK> <UNK> with a losing basketball team <UNK> hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman cathy lee crosby but a <UNK> for their new winning ways are you really surprised along the way a romance grows between the coach and the <UNK> star player jack michael <UNK> the police are never <UNK> br br <UNK> along with other crown international pictures as a <UNK> movie really does this film no service this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy <UNK> especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere <UNK> from an r rated film a side plot involving a <UNK> center who is <UNK> by his <UNK> into thinking he is former <UNK> player sydney <UNK> is the actual reason for the <UNK> new success rather than cathy lee's <UNK> too much <UNK> and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment
<START> awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar <UNK> is the same guy who directed this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br <UNK> br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an <UNK> <UNK> quality 1 star power less <UNK> makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z
<START> i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jackson's trilogy came out but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison the pace of this movie is rushed many important scenes from the book are left out and there is little character development the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over which i found distracting and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished there are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy but if you haven't read the book you'll probably be confused because there is a lot missing from this version 4 out of 10
<START> can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever answer yes and this is one of them after <UNK> the appalling <UNK> of the <UNK> director uwe boll has now cast his less than talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation don't these guys get it to anyone who can't understand here it is in block <UNK> for you video games do not make for good movies the acting here is at best sub standard the set design and special effects are poor unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom no sense of danger or menace pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is <UNK> on would have been better used as toilet paper the main <UNK> is the director uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a <UNK> hackneyed <UNK> <UNK> and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience <UNK> and bored why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets avoid at all costs
<START> seeing moonstruck after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and <UNK> funny this film was when it first appeared who knew that cher could act who had ever heard of olympia dukakis nicholas cage was the beginning of his career and vincent <UNK> and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents nor was norman <UNK> the director br br the only really flat note in this splendid work is when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's <UNK> a song that is sung too many times in the movie once is already too many and that went on to have a long <UNK> in popular music br br cher is forgive me sensational as loretta <UNK> a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> offering her his <UNK> ring as a substitute for an engagement ring then rushes off to <UNK> to be with his dying mother he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother <UNK> <UNK> the wedding loretta confronts <UNK> and quickly falls in love with him meanwhile her father vincent <UNK> is cheating on her mother olympia dukakis which loretta accidentally discovers when <UNK> invites her to the <UNK> opera br br everything works out in the end as it inevitably does in films of this genre in the meantime all the actors <UNK> themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself in its way moonstruck is how hollywood used to be at its best <UNK> entertainment with no social significance whatsoever if they'd only lost that's <UNK> along the way it would have been perfect
<START> the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b w photography of the american <UNK> is stunning we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face in the end we follow them up the <UNK> to their final moment br br the two criminals performed by robert blake and scott wilson as perry smith and dick <UNK> could be seen on any street in any town <UNK> is a smiling boy next door and smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile is part of the human condition these two <UNK> men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isn't there once on the run they start writing bad <UNK> <UNK> out a trail for the authorities br br there are many fine supporting actors i like john <UNK> as the detective on the case alvin <UNK> also will <UNK> shines in a brief but excellent scene as the <UNK> attorney br br i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short <UNK> i did finally get to it after buying the dvd the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen br br don't miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great film making is all about
<START> this is one of the best fred astaire ginger rogers films or at least one of my favorites most of the a r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories this still has the <UNK> <UNK> but not as <UNK> as the other films br br this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs the music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure she dances also with fred of course and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor br br growing up in the 1950s watching <UNK> harriet on television it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet <UNK> no surprise than <UNK> fell for this beauty although she had that short early <UNK> <UNK> i recognized her voice right away also in this movie are quick appearances by betty <UNK> and lucille ball but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball i can't find her but i know she's in here br br astaire except for some obnoxious <UNK> chewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and randolph scott although better in westerns is likable too br br this is simply a nice feel good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers
<START> this is my fourth joe <UNK> short that i've seen and so far the funniest one in this one joe takes voice lessons from a record <UNK> charles boyer and ronald colman when he goes to warner bros studio the company behind this series incidentally he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused then he encounters actor george <UNK> who's also <UNK> who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later <UNK> <UNK> and gets to the set where he automatically <UNK> the director i'll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in <UNK>
<START> the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies the battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron the story of titanic involves two fictional characters <UNK> <UNK> and kate <UNK> from different backgrounds one is a <UNK> artist the other is an aristocrat and how their love <UNK> over societal <UNK> and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on br br first of all although using a historical name this movie had little regard to history the plot was built around two fictional lovers french diamond and treasure hunters the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background many historical facts were simply forgotten where was the radio <UNK> that ignored the iceberg <UNK> why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress <UNK> <UNK> these facts is an insult to the tragedy and what was the point of <UNK> this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is br br the overall plot was rather shallow rich equals greed and corruption poverty equals compassion and <UNK> it is very ironic to spend 200 million to make a movie about how money <UNK> there was absolutely no human side shown in anti heroes it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil casting was also very poor if <UNK> was 2 <UNK> shorter than <UNK> you could swear she was his baby <UNK> the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse hearing corny pick up lines such as i see you and this is my side of the ship generated more pain than the screams of drowning people also jokes were too <UNK> and rather lame br br titanic did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original the best thing about this film were its special effects and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award br br although this film lacked <UNK> value in overall sense the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo <UNK> and so the movie became a success now it is safe to say that the industry will be less <UNK> to <UNK> large amounts of money in a single motion picture so it seems that titanic did achieve something after all
<START> i'm not a john <UNK> <UNK> although i thought <UNK> towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences i've ever had the writing is typical english <UNK> show <UNK> in fact as an audio skit this wouldn't be out of place on a <UNK> theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this <UNK> strange case into the kind of jaw dropping performance that can create <UNK> british comedy fanatics br br the brits have a gift for combining <UNK> satirical <UNK> with closely observed <UNK> of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here <UNK> portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the <UNK> and <UNK> inspector <UNK> however <UNK> has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film i'd never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he <UNK> his entire career with this performance as far as i'm concerned br br some people might not care for strange case especially if british <UNK> isn't their <UNK> tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it <UNK> from sight
<START> seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd <UNK> was one in which i did give up half way through i turned it off in bored disgust br br this movie is disjointed boring confusing and lackluster the acting was dry and without credible portrayals the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award
<START> my take a funny take on the lion king posing as a sequel surprisingly amusing br br surprisingly lion king 1 1 2 is actually another funny straight to video that's worth a theatrical treatment i don't see why disney released this straight to video and release crappy movies like chicken little and return to <UNK> <UNK> those movies are better off seen in the video stores in the new releases area rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters br br this one is merely a spoof of the first film although the events in <UNK> pride hasn't taken place yet on timon voiced by nathan lane and <UNK> voiced by ernie <UNK> point of view we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film original voices from the first film like matthew <UNK> <UNK> goldberg <UNK> martin and robert <UNK> return to their <UNK> roles from the first film while julie <UNK> and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as <UNK> mom and grumpy uncle br br so doesn't this sound fun maybe not now but go watch it for yourself the fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable it's kinda like <UNK> with timon and pumbaa br br video movie rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because i'd heard that it did not get great reviews however i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky is br br there was no bad acting at all in the whole film every single character is believable the romantic moments between <UNK> character david <UNK> and <UNK> character sophia are tear <UNK> realistic and intimate probably due to the fact that they were a soon to be real life couple br br the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending however ends are tied up towards the end leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings <UNK> of sadness shock and empathy for david <UNK> br br the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout this isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second br br i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple shallow films
<START> the impossible planet and the satan pit together <UNK> the two best episodes of the <UNK> doctor who's second season having said that it should be obvious that much of the story basically <UNK> the plot of <UNK> and the pit 1967 to an outer space setting with the history of the universe <UNK> with that of the beast <UNK> these episodes <UNK> the emotional ties between rose and the doctor whilst also <UNK> <UNK> increasing self confidence establishing her as a not quite equal yet but getting there partner with our beloved time lord also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay which <UNK> the occasional over <UNK> on one liners for the doctor and the performances of the entire cast most notably the excellent shaun <UNK> as acting captain <UNK> cross <UNK>
<START> i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldn't watch it was because of the <UNK> firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and i'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but that's a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isn't really their fault it's whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in 2003 i thought that casting people in their late <UNK> to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is i'm 17 how can anyone take that seriously don't fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you'll get far more than this movie could ever give
<START> the movie opens up with a long single shot of <UNK> in factory <UNK> with workers my what we've done to the planet you might think i hope we get to see other things like this br br that's very rare when you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations it'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't so then you'll hear some more narration watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead it really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk br br i could read <UNK> on how someone set up their camera fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time
<START> i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker <UNK> but this one sucks the director seems to be a <UNK> who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i can't believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful br br i am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the <UNK> with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort
<START> one of boris <UNK> real <UNK> essentially the dying karloff looking about <UNK> years older than he was is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies moving from <UNK> where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s <UNK> while trying to <UNK> enough money to prove his theories desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a <UNK> baron who is dying she will <UNK> him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a <UNK> who i think is married if you think i got that from watching the movie you're wrong i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened why because this movie had me lost from two minutes in i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple <UNK> plot lines little is spelled out and much isn't said until towards the end by which time i really didn't care its a dull mess of interest purely for <UNK> performance which is rather odd at times to be honest this is the only time i've ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out
<START> this movie goes beyond just being bad it is <UNK> the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you yourself have a problem with <UNK> than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film if you can call it that
<START> as usual i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven't watched yet in anticipation of the oscars i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has there is no story a group of guys <UNK> around iraq one day they are here <UNK> a bomb tomorrow they are <UNK> around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire no wait here they are back in bagdad there is no cohesive story at all the three main characters are so overly <UNK> that they are mere caricatures by that i mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe and then we have the <UNK> cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the <UNK> little <UNK> boy trying to sell soldiers dvds what do you think is going to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his <UNK> ways why yes do you think the <UNK> kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy why yes there is no story here the script is juvenile and predictable the camera is <UNK> around a lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent full metal jacket <UNK> or platoon don't waste time or money on this boring movie
<START> this serial is interesting to watch as an mst3k feature but for todays audience that's all it is i was really surprised to see the year it was made as <UNK> considering that fact alone makes this a solid <UNK> 2 in my book the cars used don't even look contemporary they look like stuff from the 30's it's basically cody the lone world's salvation <UNK> talk about an insult to everyone else like the military anyway it's cody in his <UNK> ring flying suit against <UNK> and <UNK> two dumb ss henchman who sport <UNK> and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right enjoy if you want to watch a really good serial see flash <UNK> it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women this has none of that and flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack something made in <UNK> this bad deserves a 2 <UNK> said give it a 6 if your watching it as a mst3k episode those guys have some good fun with it a <UNK> of the <UNK> here a <UNK> there and i'm flying and now as an added bonus i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character <UNK> tom <UNK> and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet br br singing at the very beginning credits br br tom <UNK> singing your watching commander cody he is the new character from republic br br he gets in trouble every week but he's saved by editing br br just a <UNK> of his <UNK> sends him on his way br br a <UNK> head and a rocket pack will save the day br br joel singing his <UNK> is a boxing ring when bad guys come to mix it up br br somebody always gets kidnapped and cody has to fix it up br br he drinks his tea at <UNK> <UNK> and flies along on <UNK> br br he beats the crooks and flies with <UNK> and puts out forest fires br br crow singing br br bad guys beware cody is there br br you'll like his hair it's under his <UNK> and because we can't think of a good rhyme br br that's the end of the commander cody theme song so sit right back with a will of <UNK> br br and watch chapter eight cause that's the enemy planet
<START> i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and <UNK> you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for 1 or 2 very short scenes i wander if <UNK> wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore but about some <UNK> witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking <UNK> <UNK> and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society <UNK> like the judges of the <UNK> but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and <UNK> bad direction <UNK> i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to <UNK> 1
<START> this is one of those films the british <UNK> <UNK> wastes its money on the main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere the characters are not interesting the story is conventional and insipid the only thing of interest is the location the city of <UNK> <UNK> in italian having only a superficial <UNK> with <UNK> i had no idea of the intricate <UNK> of its old town and that the city was so interesting i had thought <UNK> was dull i am delighted to say that i have been proved wrong so from the <UNK> point of view this film has interest the film contains one splendid performance by a little girl named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she has already made seven films despite being only 12 so she seems determined upon a career as an actress and judging by her performance in this film she should go far as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent colin <UNK> a reliable and professional actor was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest he was earnest and when asked to be <UNK> he was <UNK> but somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue the script is a total <UNK> catherine <UNK> does exceptionally well in a supporting role and showing sympathy comes naturally to her so that everybody would like to have her around i would like to tell her every time i feel a cold coming on as i know she would get me a <UNK> hot drink so there we have it <UNK> fascinating narrow <UNK> an interesting little girl and a sympathetic woman forget the rest the older sister played by <UNK> holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being <UNK> is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear i suspect the notion that this family go off to <UNK> to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited if michael <UNK> wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of <UNK> is why didn't he just go to the bbc and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity <UNK> why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of <UNK> and meandering <UNK>
<START> i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me alas i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by <UNK> upon watching again recently i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago br br there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast we have a <UNK> disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace knowing pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heart <UNK> hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character pitt pulls the show off without <UNK> to white trash clich√© or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie br br juliette lewis is equally impressive as <UNK> tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year <UNK> life experience lewis manages to evoke pity for her character's station in life as well as contempt for her <UNK> but she <UNK> her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young personally i think it's a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here br br david <UNK> and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the <UNK> couple who <UNK> end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis <UNK> is <UNK> geeky and naive and forbes seems <UNK> cynical and shut off but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued <UNK> and strangely attracted to pitt br br the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing at the time <UNK> was released hollywood was releasing a slew of nice character turns out to be psychotic movies <UNK> white <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the hand that rocks the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> etc most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy <UNK> doesn't really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow <UNK> thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn br br when the penny does drop and pitt is let loose to play the <UNK> bad guy the film shifts <UNK> completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie that said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold the fight is over but the <UNK> will always be there br br much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre x files <UNK> is a tad contrived of course it's meant to be from the book the <UNK> journalist character has written so one could argue that the self conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of <UNK> style in which most <UNK> write br br the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 of the thrillers of the past twenty years highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind this film is disturbing on more than one level but then it's meant to be
<START> it is nice to see <UNK> <UNK> back at what he is best at a story woven around a marriage it feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family though the story is simple and does not contain any new elements you still like the movie because of the presentation performances and actually the over all treatment hats off to <UNK> the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love the depiction of the changes in the way of thinking behaving once you get engaged is excellent director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection though the movie is slow you don't mind it because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple as a typical <UNK> stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears specially ladies but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth
<START> for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite <UNK> the tcm uk cable channel which <UNK> scores of mgm titles week in week out more <UNK> it's still m i a on dvd ¬ñ even from <UNK> recently announced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts maybe they're saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this <UNK> of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the <UNK> <UNK> of his <UNK> br br i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish <UNK> with a <UNK> hatred of indians and who <UNK> to exploit his expert <UNK> by making some easy money hunting <UNK> an opening statement offers the <UNK> <UNK> that the population of this species was reduced from 60 000 000 to 3 000 in the space of just 30 years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger ¬ñ who <UNK> alcoholic <UNK> <UNK> lloyd nolan who continually <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> taylor and teenage half breed russ <UNK> to this end as expected the <UNK> relationship is a shaky one ¬ñ reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony <UNK> the naked <UNK> 1953 another bleak open air mgm western the film in fact <UNK> <UNK> the flavor and <UNK> of <UNK> work in this field despite being writer director <UNK> first of just a handful of such <UNK> but which <UNK> <UNK> a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra <UNK> also a half breed to be <UNK> between the two rugged leads ¬ñ and granger like the james stewart of the naked <UNK> returns to his job only <UNK> his <UNK> at having to kill <UNK> for mere sport and profit is effectively realized br br the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take <UNK> for himself ¬ñ she <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> his approaches while secretly <UNK> for granger ¬ñ and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesn't come out <UNK> from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> 1948 he becomes <UNK> and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare ¬ñ and therefore precious ¬ñ hide of a white buffalo they've caught he even goes buffalo crazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming <UNK> into taking the <UNK> of thunder for the <UNK> of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive ¬ñ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the ground when hit the endless line up of the day's catch and the <UNK> which subsequently <UNK> the meadows the film's <UNK> but memorable denouement then is <UNK> famous with winter in full swing a now paranoid taylor out for <UNK> blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and <UNK> have taken <UNK> to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a <UNK> position ¬ñ frozen to death br br incidentally my father owns a copy of the <UNK> source novel of this by <UNK> <UNK> from the time of the film's original release actually he has <UNK> a vast number of such <UNK> ¬ñ it is after all a practice still in <UNK> ¬ñ where a book is re <UNK> to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger ¬ñ who work very well off each other here ¬ñ had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the <UNK> adventure all the brothers were <UNK> 1953 <UNK> curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that it's not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages
<START> i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in <UNK> it through <UNK> and i have to say it did not deserve it br br <UNK> was so hyped that i was really looking forward to watch it br br <UNK> is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film makers despite having a great story it was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original it was loosely based on the classic on the <UNK> br br anil kapoor was irritating especially when he comes from america the direction lacked quality many a times except a few in between scenes br br give this script to any of them ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i'm 100 sure they'll make a mind blowing movie out of it br br i'm not saying <UNK> was bad it was just not good enough
<START> i read holes in <UNK> grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was <UNK> of course being my busy self i didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters holes was at the drive in just out of town but alas we were just too busy i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me they all said it was good but i've read great books that have made crappy movies so i was <UNK> worried br br suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to <UNK> my sister who is 9 and i watched it and absolutely loved it i then took it to the other people i was <UNK> house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too even my parents loved it and they're <UNK> movie critics overall i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family <UNK> and and loves a hilarious cast this movie should be on your top 5 to see list
<START> the absolute <UNK> of the <UNK> of that <UNK> <UNK> douglas sirk born <UNK> <UNK> written on the wind <UNK> our <UNK> attention in every <UNK> frame from its <UNK> famous opening sequence with the leaves blowing into the <UNK> <UNK> of a texas mansion and the wind <UNK> the pages of the <UNK> into a flashback the movie <UNK> into its 99 minutes all the <UNK> intrigue that was to fuel such later little screen <UNK> as dallas <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> over their years long runs br br the combination of wealth and <UNK> is a theme americans in our dollar based society find irresistible brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled troubled <UNK> to the <UNK> oil fortune <UNK> <UNK> rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane <UNK> who try to keep the <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> it's been <UNK> that the story was based on <UNK> <UNK> marriage into reynolds <UNK> money as always the <UNK> get all the scenery to chew and the best lines to spit out malone in her oscar <UNK> performance as the <UNK> <UNK> with a jones for hudson gets to <UNK> a whole fireworks display of them hudson while good can't compete with all this over the top <UNK> bacall starts out strong but grows <UNK> a mere plot <UNK> no matter with a succession of set pieces shot in <UNK> <UNK> sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush <UNK> paradise of late 50s america nobody ever did it better
<START> this movie has made me upset when i think of cat in the hat im thinking of cat in the hat books you know the one from a few years back that parents read to <UNK> children well i though that this movie would be a lot like that but much to my <UNK> was nothing like the books <UNK> it is more like young adult humor movie in one part cat is talking to a <UNK> tool <UNK> cat talks to it like it is his <UNK> <UNK> adult humor the <UNK> of his car i all so though was a little <UNK> for a kids movie under the rating you'll find mild <UNK> humor and some double <UNK> i think in short this means adult humor i wish i could return this movie wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy
<START> i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid <UNK> and respect some <UNK> military principles <UNK> barely does the first <UNK> being a russian war film i was expecting <UNK> sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score <UNK> <UNK> and cruel germans what i didn't need was the naive love non affair the <UNK> silly war scenes and the abuse of the <UNK> soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references <UNK> <UNK> holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently
<START> spoilers slow as <UNK> mummy movie involving this <UNK> in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be <UNK> in order to keep the native population who are at the time revolting against british rule from finding out about it br br given the task of getting to this <UNK> dig by his superiors british capt storm mark dana together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs sylvia quentin diane <UNK> the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin george n <UNK> make their way to the <UNK> <UNK> tomb on the way there capt storm sylvia and his men run into this desert like princess <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> seems to be <UNK> in her ability to <UNK> the <UNK> of desert life she doesn't drink water or get tired but also knows just what capt storm co are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig <UNK> <UNK> ha <UNK> tomb as possible br br at <UNK> ha <UNK> burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of <UNK> together with his <UNK> guide <UNK> brother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> already opened his tomb before capt storm can get there to stop them quentin <UNK> <UNK> ha <UNK> body by having dr <UNK> guy <UNK> cut his <UNK> this action on <UNK> and dr <UNK> part has <UNK> faint dead in his tracks it later turns out that <UNK> somehow was possessed by <UNK> ha <UNK> spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age at the rate of 500 years per hour to become himself a 3 000 year old mummy br br the movie has <UNK> dressed in what looks like a pair of <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> ha <UNK> tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive like a vampire of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with this blood sucking adventure by <UNK> with him later losing his right arm goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance you in fact thought that he already found it to <UNK> ha <UNK> tomb <UNK> himself killed is an <UNK> rock slide br br we learn at the end of the movie that <UNK> to absolutely no one's surprise is actually <UNK> ha <UNK> <UNK> into another some 3 000 years later person or life <UNK> sister the mysterious and sexy <UNK> is not only <UNK> ha <UNK> sister since him and <UNK> are really one and the same person but also the egyptian cat <UNK> <UNK> also not that hard to figure out br br with <UNK> <UNK> ha <UNK> back in his tomb and all the deaths due the the <UNK> curse now at an end capt storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert <UNK> <UNK> expedition trek their way back to <UNK> and modern this in <UNK> civilization the survivors of <UNK> <UNK> ha <UNK> curse keep what they found and <UNK> only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway
<START> the flock is <UNK> <UNK> as a lesser <UNK> ripoff there's really no reason to compare the two except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown br br now that that's out of the way i'll go into why the flock is very interesting in some respects mostly it's a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very <UNK> social worker who <UNK> sexual <UNK> at the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him evident in two scenes where first he's <UNK> an <UNK> and <UNK> him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his <UNK> br br gere is very good as errol <UNK> the aforementioned social worker his way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer he carries a gun and is constantly checking <UNK> and supplies law officials with information if some of his flock may be responsible for a sexual crime he's also a person who's lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from <UNK> his own vigilante justice on his flock twice you see him smile once when he's <UNK> for treating his partner <UNK> and the other after he's beaten up a member of his flock br br as a suspense flick the flock isn't as successful somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces br br overall the flock is a solid drama about a man performing a <UNK> job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being <UNK> by the <UNK> he's surrounded himself in the world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is the flock gets that point across nicely
<START> i never saw the original 1954 version with judy garland so have no means of comparison also it's been some years but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating the movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions john norman howard is a worn out <UNK> rock star on the decline <UNK> upon a romance with a fresh talented new singing sensation esther hoffman her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline br br the lead actors kris kristofferson and barbra streisand are adequate in their roles but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect <UNK> beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song <UNK> she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice
<START> this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b movies bad porn movies without the hardcore sex the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife the rest of the movie however leaves something to be desired bad acting bad direction bad looking woman bad sets bad cinematography bad sound and bad sex scenes the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic they don't even have the common sense to have <UNK> hall naked or in a love scene br br how dumb is that
<START> 50 years old this musical comedy fantasy might look its age but it wears it with dignity br br this film is still great fun crosby was never really romantic lead material but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs <UNK> plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths <UNK> how <UNK> for a knight of the realm a genuine one to throw himself into <UNK> like this with such abandon and <UNK> <UNK> enjoys herself in the least <UNK> of the main roles only <UNK> <UNK> disappoints as an unconvincing <UNK> br br though not a musical the songs are very good and the dance routine accompanying busy doing nothing is perfect funny appropriate <UNK> without being challenging and making a virtue out of <UNK> musical movement which let's be fair was <UNK> amusing due <UNK> its never being his greatest strength br br the colour is fine the sound is a little <UNK> in places br br and the story well it takes some liberties with the original but i suspect that mr <UNK> might well have been pleased with the result
<START> this movie is the perfect <UNK> of how not to make a sci fi movie the worst tendency in sci fi is to make your theme an awful <UNK> pseudo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vision of the human future br br science fiction filmmakers and authors as <UNK> take themselves very seriously given the high crap to good stuff ratio of their genre i think other genres with a high <UNK> yes i just made it up relax like horror or action or even romantic comedy seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound message br br sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level as numerous great filmmakers have <UNK> but there is an immense downside to the whole concept which is represented by robot <UNK> with its low rent construction of the future lone good design element the bizarre slick looking <UNK> ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies and its painfully heavy handed <UNK> parallels he's named <UNK> for god's sake i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the <UNK> time but i went to public school so the filmmakers are not <UNK> br br of course if you're a crazy movie freak like me this downside has a great upside i absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones it's kind of a lester <UNK> approach to movie viewing i guess br br note the lead in this movie gary graham is that his name i refuse to go check is really not that bad he makes a go of it he's kind of cool especially when he's drunk hung over
<START> i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel surfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then i've been on the <UNK> <UNK> tv <UNK> flipping through dvd vhs <UNK> at stores but didn't find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a world class <UNK> i still didn't order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting <UNK> or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it br br so what do i think about the film it's good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the 9 99 it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7 10 with potential to become an 8 10 i'll have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid <UNK> to catch some dialogue
<START> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps most notable for being the only x rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didn't really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didn't consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners ¬ñ a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybody's <UNK> at me i don't hear a word they're <UNK> make this film one of the finest <UNK> of life <UNK> and friendship ever released br br young joe buck then newcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a <UNK> cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet <UNK> ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a <UNK> crippled <UNK> who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same <UNK> ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely <UNK> lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new york br br joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him <UNK> paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as <UNK> as joe ratso with his painful limp and <UNK> <UNK> is always <UNK> himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of <UNK> and george of john <UNK> classic novel <UNK> mice and men ' br br shot largely on the streets of new york <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> realistic look at life in the <UNK> watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> our <UNK> stiff from the <UNK> winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two <UNK> <UNK> of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role i'm <UNK> here i'm <UNK> here managing to steer well clear of being <UNK> after his much <UNK> debut in <UNK> 'the graduate ' both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting ¬ñ <UNK> ¬ñ was sylvia miles for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> <UNK> eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for <UNK> and best writing for <UNK> salt br br <UNK> <UNK> is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at <UNK> past rather than <UNK> explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the <UNK> beautiful final scene leaves us with a <UNK> of hope but a large amount of <UNK> gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating <UNK> <UNK> is one for the ages
<START> although kris kristofferson is good in this role who wouldn't want to see elvis <UNK> instead with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away <UNK> agent to be apart of the movie it was a mistake this would have been a perfect movie for elvis even though the soundtrack is far from terrific paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this period piece musical somewhat of a love story this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption like is most <UNK> the hero of the story was die also gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role
<START> william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of <UNK> it they move with their daughter sophie emma <UNK> and become friends of their neighbors jean patricia <UNK> and george evans brian <UNK> however eerie events happen in the house <UNK> the death of <UNK> cat in <UNK> birthday party a <UNK> <UNK> blood and they leave the place <UNK> a secret later br br the house that <UNK> to death is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series hammer house of horror the fantastic twist <UNK> a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent my vote is eight br br title brazil a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the house that <UNK> to death
<START> <UNK> effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to <UNK> this director's <UNK> for war the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue <UNK> but we learn that europeans at the <UNK> between wwi and wwii had concerning <UNK> for lack of a better term the speeches given by both <UNK> of each country at the end of the film are inspiring given the time although the <UNK> edition through the transfer technology of early foreign films cuts off characters heads at times this film holds it's own in many different aspects character analysis lighting techniques historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker br br <UNK> went on to direct and put to screen <UNK> <UNK> three penny opera starring the original star <UNK> <UNK>
<START> yes i admit i cried during this movie it was so incredibly disappointing that i couldn't help myself but cry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> network has done it again first with having the million dollar man ex professional wrestler on their program and now this br br the <UNK> code follows a stream of <UNK> <UNK> oriented movies it was quite amusing yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so <UNK> inaccurate the movie follows what is known as the bible code rather than following actual biblical <UNK> this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie br br i highly recommend you do not watch this movie even if your life <UNK> on it
<START> i grew up with h r <UNK> and the <UNK> talented jack wild and now my daughters are <UNK> fans of jack wild too this movie is exactly what movies should be fun and entertaining this movie is not limited to children either a lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and <UNK> performance is something you do not want to miss the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama <UNK> beautifully and as a jack wild fan i would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing knowing the hard life that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song if i could it makes me pause in loving <UNK> for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that i am now passing on to my children let's all go to living island where there is friendship and fun and keep jack <UNK> memory alive by passing <UNK> on to others
<START> kenny <UNK> as jed willis is <UNK> in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on br br the movie <UNK> at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i don't think i can think of another movie except perhaps <UNK> romeo and juliet that captures that <UNK> joy that well br br the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal <UNK> in that sense it is much the same appeal as <UNK> murder or a miss <UNK> mystery without the mayhem br br this is a great <UNK> to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages
<START> i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black <UNK> cab <UNK> <UNK> smith not <UNK> baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas <UNK> <UNK> bill <UNK> robinson <UNK> <UNK> notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed <UNK> club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature br br <UNK> <UNK> cartoons tended to be more <UNK> and more <UNK> after all we are talking about m g m than the standard animated short done over at <UNK> paramount universal fox rko or <UNK> columbia even disney's very early mickey mouse had loads of <UNK> humor before uncle walt <UNK> him up just before he went technicolor br br disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black <UNK> as well for example <UNK> silly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place 50 years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also <UNK> <UNK> and even <UNK> by future viewers
<START> i gave this film 8 out of 10 <UNK> 10 for e g <UNK> and 9 for <UNK> millionaire most recently this film is close to <UNK> but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding <UNK> life mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully to understand it you really need to be one of <UNK> this is an amazing movie much better and more contemporary of his previous films which are boring at this time i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie i like humour <UNK> humour photography is an art itself each scene is artistic to the limit plot is probably a fairy tale don't recall it now but remember reading to my daughter going to sleep a similar story
<START> a young woman <UNK> becomes part of a kidnapping plot involving the son of a movie producer she is <UNK> the <UNK> happen to be former business partners of the son's father and are looking to exact some revenge on him our babysitter must <UNK> her time and wait to see what will become of the son and herself while the <UNK> begin to argue amongst themselves placing the kidnap victims in great peril according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br that acclaimed director <UNK> <UNK> could be responsible for this <UNK> crime thriller is the real shocker despite beginning with the appearance of having been edited in a <UNK> machine the film develops a linear storyline once you've figured out what is going on the engaging maria schneider as michelle and endearing john <UNK> as boots can get you through the film there are a couple of female nude scenes which fit into the storyline well br br wanted babysitter 10 15 75 <UNK> <UNK> maria schneider john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset br br but it's basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are <UNK> in spanish so non spanish <UNK> will be left a little lost br br i had it as a <UNK> gift as it's a family <UNK> to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew <UNK> was just awesome in a time to kill and the the <UNK> boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work br br however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew <UNK> film and uses this as a marketing <UNK> he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of view br br the films star though patrick <UNK> is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy he'd be well written into a <UNK> com br br so for true <UNK> acting brilliance of the ones i've seen i'd recommend a time to kill the <UNK> boys <UNK> how to lose a guy in 10 days <UNK> and <UNK> and avoid too larger than life and angels in the <UNK> unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are <UNK> of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again <UNK> is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines br br as for <UNK> <UNK> not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either
<START> i'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lee's latest a wee bit boring although he was trying something different i e not just <UNK> the rise and fall of the serial killer i don't think it worked too well br br there's really a bit too much going on <UNK> john <UNK> and <UNK> mira sorvino relationship <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is good but at the end thats all you have 2 or 3 stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film br br there are some good points though all scenes with the <UNK> of <UNK> killer david <UNK> look very nice colour <UNK> etc and the acting is pretty good throughout br br overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings it just wasn't strong enough in the end br br
<START> spoilers spoilers br br this movie the <UNK> is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story <UNK> around a <UNK> wwii german submarine i've got a fetish for german <UNK> especially <UNK> that can be <UNK> upon so i was a bit <UNK> about the danish part but <UNK> that the sub could <UNK> up that part knowing that <UNK> films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very <UNK> br br upon viewing i was surprised br br i had some thoughts on the actors being <UNK> seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and it's all good br br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitles br br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german <UNK> i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research it's all good br br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war it's a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect it's a crossing between a type <UNK> type <UNK> and a japanese transport sub similar to i <UNK> it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck br br the setting is on a danish island or <UNK> i can't remember it's <UNK> and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a <UNK> of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island <UNK> some <UNK> teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again it's all good br br plot wise the island gets some <UNK> of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the <UNK> an old <UNK> and it's crew one of the <UNK> a man in his 50's has the german eagle and <UNK> <UNK> on his back the <UNK> senior citizens all remember when a german u boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the <UNK> u boat shortly after german bodies started floating <UNK> back in 1945 no submarine was ever found br br what to expect br br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting <UNK> competition teen love conspiracy and a surprise br br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless <UNK> well into the story and poses no problem it's not like from <UNK> <UNK> dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtle br br overall really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with <UNK> resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 <UNK> worth your while yes a child's story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nice br br <UNK> 2001 br br
<START> this movie is one of the most awful i've ever seen not only is the dialogue awful it never ends you'll think it's ending but it's not how long is it <UNK> <UNK> minutes i don't even know i do know that i'll never watch it again it's like someone took a romantic comedy took out the comedy then decided to <UNK> the romance leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen but don't take my word for it find out for yourself how terrible this film is
<START> it ran 8 seasons but it's first in early 1959 and it's last in the <UNK> of 1965 were shorter than seasons 2 7 cbs chief william <UNK> canceled <UNK> production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in september 1965 because he disliked the series without eric <UNK> as <UNK> favor who had <UNK> after season 7 the last new episode aired in november 1965 the lone 1966 cbs broadcast on january 4 1966 was a <UNK> br br i have often wondered why <UNK> didn't switch to color filming for it's last season most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 cbs was <UNK> in color that <UNK> for many of their sitcoms but westerns like <UNK> and <UNK> remained in black and white <UNK> was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on september 17 1966 for the episode snap decision
<START> this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen to begin i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown you are <UNK> wrong in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover it's just an image they must have found on <UNK> and thought it looked cool speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer <UNK> it's young in a <UNK> of <UNK> i mean seriously wtf how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right wrong the next day i gave it to my work colleague <UNK> myself from the plague named s i c k br br bottom line is don't see this film
<START> i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasn't sure that i was getting whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies i e sister act br br however this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking br br this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community i do think that it is worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you
<START> first thing i noticed in this movie of course was the unnecessary amount of nudity it's not <UNK> nudity or anything but a lot that was not needed <UNK> <UNK> plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her <UNK> who <UNK> resembles her was a werewolf and believes their fate are destined to be the same which actually i found quite interesting the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting unfortunately this is not the film i was searching for br br instead we know <UNK> not a werewolf from the beginning so there's no thrill or twist also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario they fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible br br <UNK> <UNK> is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role since the character <UNK> has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and <UNK> and <UNK> like a wolf it takes little skill to play she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light the idea is great but <UNK> executed throughout the film 3 10
<START> i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but i can say with some relief that it's not so <UNK> with <UNK> that it's painful for a red blooded male to watch except for a single instance at the very end of the movie i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self indulgent melodrama ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie br br ann lord is elderly bed ridden and spending her last few days on earth as <UNK> as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side <UNK> by the memories of her past ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before harris while both of her daughters <UNK> contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and <UNK> her ill <UNK> affair with this mysterious man at this of all times ann <UNK> back in her head to the <UNK> day she met harris and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with br br both ann and her two daughters one married with children one a serial <UNK> struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time are we all one day <UNK> to realize that love never lasts forever will we all realize that <UNK> for the <UNK> is the only realistic outcome the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her <UNK> is not lost on her two daughters br br the cinematography for evening is interesting most of the film is spent in <UNK> mind as she recalls the past and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately <UNK> to give everyone an <UNK> glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past claire danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just <UNK> 5 in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test br br you can't really talk trash about the cast which leads off with claire danes and doesn't let up from there vanessa redgrave patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film br br i can't really say anything negative about this film at all though hugh <UNK> struggle to have his character emerge from utter one <UNK> is in the end a total loss playing the spoiled lovable drunk <UNK> of the <UNK> rich who puts up a front of great <UNK> but is secretly scared stiff of never <UNK> to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration he had his orders and stuck to them br br in the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly <UNK> and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick it'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all
<START> i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now i managed to get it on dvd for my 18th birthday and was over <UNK> because i had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger my favourite character is charlie because he learns to be a good dog the movie is filled with fun songs and music the animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect this movie has always been a <UNK> for me but i think that if i hadn't seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as i do although i still believe that i would still like it because i am really into animated movies
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> does a little <UNK> and a movie most foul
<START> this movie sucks ass something about a <UNK> in some european country complete trash there's nothing going for this movie whatsoever maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it there is a very annoying chick who <UNK> rides with people and really <UNK> me off this movie is complete <UNK> and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it i regret it it's very boring i would rate it zero but i can't no body in their right mind should see this i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did how could they think up something this bad even mystery men was better mystery men that sucks that movie wasn't worth being made complete waste of time the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored
<START> <UNK> at our <UNK> is the best film ever made now that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short <UNK> of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie first of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian <UNK> and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f <UNK> smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro mormon and sort of anti every other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with <UNK> and half full with <UNK> it shows all the main and role model characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very <UNK> <UNK> it shows how beautiful <UNK> are and how cold hearted and ignorant <UNK> are instead of showing a little <UNK> like would be appropriate and realistic i'm a part of neither religion i'm actually an <UNK> but this offended me along with another countless amount of <UNK> most likely it shows the <UNK> as being very <UNK> and <UNK> to the <UNK> and the <UNK> being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them sorry i didn't mean to go off on a rant br br another aspect of <UNK> at our <UNK> i didn't much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i wasn't too much impressed with dan <UNK> who's the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say he's way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clich√©s for example the main character <UNK> <UNK> finds <UNK> with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a <UNK> way of life how clich√© is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic clich√© <UNK> buys the poor lonely <UNK> a puppy dog <UNK> br br if you want my advice stay as far away from <UNK> at our <UNK> as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade d br br my ratings guide a <UNK> flawless a a masterpiece near perfect a excellent b great b very good b good c a mixed bag c average c disappointing d bad d very bad d <UNK> horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood <UNK>
<START> this film is based on the novel by john <UNK> could someone please tell me why i see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way if you want to make a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> then how could you possibly make a connection to ask the dust the novel and if you wanted to make this story into a film then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i don't get it br br the adaptation of the story is poorly made and if you have read the book and liked it i'm almost sure you won't like what <UNK> did with it br br in the beginning of the film you'll maybe find the casting odd the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone but you hope for the best i really hoped a lot during this film i actually wanted it to be good but it only gets worse and it is as simple as that whether you read <UNK> novel or not this is not a good film just another romantic melodramatic hollywood production combined with bad acting lack of structure and of course plenty of shots of colin <UNK> naked butt br br i could complain a lot more about this film but why waste my time i've seen it alright i had to see it because i like the book so much and was curious and i'm very disappointed br br 1 10 is for <UNK> sweet little mustache in the end of the film so sweet had he worn it the whole time through i'd given it 2 10
<START> richard attenborough is a director whose name is <UNK> with the academy award winning <UNK> back in <UNK> i didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across <UNK> <UNK> released back in 1987 while it may not have been as popular as his gandhi it is every bit as gripping if not more and was released when south africa still had not got rid of the <UNK> of apartheid while most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened i guess this one released during the time br br the story is based on real life characters and events the book on which the movie was based was written by donald woods kevin kline a journalist who used to work in south africa until the end of the seventies it <UNK> the origins of woods friendship with the charismatic black leader steve biko who is wonderfully portrayed by denzel washington i cannot imagine a better choice for the role washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence which <UNK> character required br br while initially woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by biko after meeting the man he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas the bond between them grows stronger and woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people biko represents br br however finally tragedy strikes and woods must now concentrate on escaping from south africa with his book so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on the second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from south africa along with his family and will keep you on <UNK> br br there are some deliciously humorous dialogues too the scene between biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example br br lawyer do you <UNK> violence biko i <UNK> a confrontation lawyer well isn't that violence mr biko biko not necessarily you and i are having a confrontation now but i don't see any violence br br however there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that <UNK> the country before better sense <UNK> the scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking br br this is definitely a must watch i would suggest those not familiar with <UNK> work do take time out for this there are movies which make a lot of money and there are movies which make lives i would any day prefer the latter
<START> why watch this there is only one reason and that is for the greatness of john <UNK> i love his acting my most favorite appearances by him are in nightmare on elm street 1 3 and 7 as <UNK> father a cop black christmas as a cop and from <UNK> till dawn again as a cop when i was <UNK> through my local mall video <UNK> i came across the film zombie death house and i quickly tossed it back but before moving on i noticed that john <UNK> was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that i have ever heard of a director this intrigued me also the cheap 9 00 price tag and i and i had to have it upon coming home i realized that this film did not live up to <UNK> other work even his acting which may have been muddled by the added <UNK> of directing but it was not just him the other actors sucked too it seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act the film even looks of 80's porn quality i cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80's who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late or a fan of crap films than this one is for also if you dig john <UNK> as i do
<START> the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies <UNK> is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen <UNK> until i saw the imdb profile i can't say anything bad about peter <UNK> he's one of my favorite actors i love anne rice i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little too real for me i prefer <UNK> and <UNK> witty little <UNK> to the struggles of slaves <UNK> <UNK> was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i don't want to give anything away sorry but it's just not my type of show
<START> gene hackman gets himself <UNK> out of prison by a <UNK> government agency who want him for an assassination it's a given of course that hackman has the <UNK> skills for the job br br nobody tells him anything though he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information that's supposed to be suspenseful instead it's annoying and boring br br hackman goes through with the mission but the <UNK> is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious <UNK> orders everybody dead to cover it up so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care br br one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit maybe something really was lost in the translation but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience br br a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark <UNK> <UNK> mickey rooney eli <UNK> and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime br br and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this the fbi the cia the <UNK> or even the irs
<START> today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy <UNK> attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin <UNK> porter video dvd guide 2003 and ¬ñ wow ¬ñ four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the <UNK> in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben <UNK> as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio <UNK> or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater <UNK> certainly are the presence of the playboy <UNK> and <UNK> of the year dorothy <UNK> murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a <UNK> the dorothy <UNK> story the amazing beauty of the sexy <UNK> <UNK> the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fifty two years old audrey hepburn and the song <UNK> from <UNK> carlos although i do not like him <UNK> carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these <UNK> <UNK> dorothy <UNK> my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> many laughs and lots of happiness
<START> so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with <UNK> snakes <UNK> tons of <UNK> from the aforementioned <UNK> and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close br br this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category the films for people who just had their teeth <UNK> have a <UNK> or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films it's too <UNK> well steve is too <UNK> he's just so happy all the time and would cut right through the <UNK> teenager i can hear it now that movie was so stupid or the <UNK> with <UNK> i'd say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasn't happened yet i agreed they're <UNK> but i'm still not going to pet them br br plot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a <UNK> electronic <UNK> but the movie was filled with animals and steve and <UNK> which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that way br br i was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and <UNK> having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still can't believe we won't see steve anymore i hope that <UNK> and the children continue to be involved in the australia <UNK> and the discovery channel at least i can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me <UNK> how wonderful that croc is <UNK>
<START> unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from <UNK> thompson david <UNK> we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and <UNK> <UNK> is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly that's it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual <UNK> situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you <UNK> and there are some that make you <UNK> this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left i'm so glad i did not pay for this br br despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even <UNK> bad it's <UNK> material i'm very <UNK> of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthy br br no this piece of over <UNK> rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and <UNK> how this is currently rated a 7 2 completely <UNK> me <UNK> or somehow <UNK> the voting system is all that i can think of as answers br br i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10
<START> though structured totally different from the book by tim <UNK> who wrote the original 'the <UNK> <UNK> it does have the same overall feel except for that <UNK> style is less business like and more <UNK> the beginning is great the middle is fine but the <UNK> is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an <UNK> as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject <UNK> <UNK> stays always within the boundaries of good taste <UNK> <UNK> tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more
<START> i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv but thought well diane keaton is always worth watching i stand <UNK> everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame br br i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clich√©d and <UNK> that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms keaton thought she could make a <UNK> purse out of this <UNK> ear none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable the acting looked like <UNK> in a beginning class i <UNK> in open mouthed horror through most of this wondering what were they thinking very very sad that it has come to this don't waste your time
<START> this is absolutely one of the best movies i've ever seen it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time br br the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael <UNK> he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays <UNK> who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roll in gilbert <UNK> and then there is the most beautiful song in the world <UNK> <UNK> br br i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy
<START> oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king <UNK> love child it totally took away from the believability of the character now i knew there wasn't a bigfoot chasing people <UNK> around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon so from then on the whole movie was shot for me the money they <UNK> down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger <UNK> did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my <UNK> led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch hunters must watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie
<START> a great film <UNK> an acquired taste if you're into action <UNK> <UNK> films and hate serious love stories then its not for you otherwise if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again i recommend this very highly easily the best film produced in bollywood this century br br the only other indian film i would give 10 10 for is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> even then it comes second to this masterpiece
<START> i'm sure this was one of those <UNK> <UNK> in 1982 when <UNK> opened but now it's just silly the film's message is clich√© the circle vision is <UNK> and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish they'd <UNK> seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong you're standing there for 18 minutes <UNK> against a short little <UNK> disney should make a newer <UNK> like attraction to <UNK> things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless you're eating there move directly to the united kingdom
<START> many of the lead characters in <UNK> <UNK> 1969 film <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> <UNK> punishment were actual historical figures in western name order format <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the name <UNK> a historical term refers to a group of four super <UNK> who carried out numerous <UNK> of key figures in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the mid <UNK> under the orders of <UNK> the leader of the <UNK> i e ultra <UNK> pro emperor <UNK> of the <UNK> clan what was this struggle about sad to say you won't find out in this film brilliant history lesson indeed br br no <UNK> is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody <UNK> and <UNK> and at absurd length the inner torment of the not very bright killer <UNK> <UNK> than in revealing actual history <UNK> for example was someone of historical significance considered to be the father of the <UNK> japanese navy the closest <UNK> comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which <UNK> whom <UNK> considers a <UNK> to the <UNK> cause comes to <UNK> mansion to try to <UNK> him <UNK> he begins by talking about the international political situation with foreign <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and a japan that is too weak <UNK> to defend against them want to know more sorry <UNK> cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence so much for <UNK> his audience about a turning point in japanese history br br the film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle for the two and a half centuries that the <UNK> held central power in japan it was an institution dedicated to <UNK> social change to <UNK> the <UNK> relations of society it was <UNK> of outside <UNK> both <UNK> and technological in keeping with this spirit it <UNK> <UNK> those <UNK> of <UNK> in europe and the <UNK> with which a <UNK> could have stood up to a samurai throughout this period the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual <UNK> br br but in the towns which stood in neutral <UNK> between the <UNK> <UNK> a new class of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> was developing the class known in europe by its french name the <UNK> inevitably as this new class gained strength it <UNK> against the many confines of <UNK> society as in europe the king emperor became the central figure in the <UNK> struggle for power against the <UNK> <UNK> but a political <UNK> does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves when the outside world arrived with a bang in <UNK> in the form of u s <UNK> <UNK> black ships the <UNK> elite of japan was thrown into a crisis their military was no match for these <UNK> also they had heard about the havoc the british and french <UNK> were <UNK> in china what should japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor surprisingly some elements within the usually <UNK> <UNK> were inclined to open trade with the <UNK> in order to obtain some of their advanced technology this is the point of view represented just barely in the film by <UNK> on the other hand the emperor loyal ultra <UNK> represented by <UNK> believed they could keep out the <UNK> by force if only they could prevent the other <UNK> from selling out the country sound familiar thus the assassination of key <UNK> figures is in order and away we go br br <UNK> motivations were for me the film's biggest puzzle <UNK> suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal <UNK> rather than for the <UNK> cause can we take this to represent the <UNK> of the <UNK> as a whole do you care br br several reviewers have compared this film <UNK> with <UNK> which <UNK> made in the same year but where <UNK> is a <UNK> suspenseful adventure yarn with a hero worthy of sympathy <UNK> is plodding nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero <UNK> could have been this film's hero but we are not allowed to know him nor what he stands for well enough for him to achieve that status br br in view of his wonderful scores for five previous kurosawa films <UNK> <UNK> score here was very disappointing sounding like something rejected from a bonanza episode br br barry freed
<START> this movie is just funny mindless but funny to enjoy this movie completely you can't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and <UNK> which are involved with the film i still find the bit at the start funny when he says want a beer <UNK> funny stuff but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don't believe but this is different and just focuses on being funny i must say though <UNK> <UNK> is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys coop <UNK> and <UNK> are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch
<START> this movie lacked everything story acting surprise <UNK> and a soul fifteen minutes in i was staring at the screen saying how could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends even without the girl another fifteen minutes in i was praying for as much amanda <UNK> as possible when a bad movie quietly <UNK> it's ugly head eye candy is a nice <UNK> but there wasn't much of that cheated on all <UNK>
<START> most reviews say that this is the weakest point in <UNK> short movie career this movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from hamilton br br knowing hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised while <UNK> looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes laura concentrates on few characters what <UNK> developing relations among them male female artist model but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot <UNK> <UNK> is different from both it is only <UNK> movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than <UNK> fans looking like an erotic comedy but not german soft core type <UNK> report fans would be very disappointed you won't laugh a lot but you can smile and that's something you don't often get from hamilton unlike all other <UNK> movies the age of female <UNK> unlike other movies main character is a boy unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time we have characters that live their life have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to another br br unfortunately hamilton again gets lost with a script in his hands girls on <UNK> under shower in low light rooms in gardens under <UNK> in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does you'll always feel the <UNK> eye and hand behind it but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script hamilton is best known for his <UNK> but they are just a part of his work and in <UNK> <UNK> we have a reverse situation his girls are not in the best shots nature garden house remind us on <UNK> work often neglected part of it while girls even when nude don't have anything special in the way he presents us maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new and no one <UNK> to tell him he shouldn't but he neglected what he was mostly praised for
<START> had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy <UNK> toss together with no direction or resolution how do these people get through film school who gives them money to make this crap could have been so much more fine lead actor and i always like <UNK> <UNK> but come on the <UNK> rock metaphor of just staring <UNK> unable to find anything compelling is just so tired and it sure doesn't make for good films the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say this is like the throw spaghetti at the wall school of art making just <UNK> a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges that can work if the director actually has any kind of vision or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential but here it's just space filler of no consequence i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit and was yelling you lazy bastard at the screen when the credits popped up
<START> i watched this film a long time ago <UNK> 10 years or so and liked it then i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again the second time around was not pleasant the acting is <UNK> <UNK> the plot is illogical <UNK> and predictable br br the acting i'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters the plot there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd side note why did <UNK> not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer <UNK> <UNK> we have a crook it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can <UNK> the <UNK> or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources it plays too much on sympathy b c all of them die in the end bar <UNK> but it's not sad you're thinking <UNK> were so stupid they deserve to die you just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person br br i can't believe this film rates over a 5
<START> i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me notwithstanding this is not a movie with a plot its about real guys and some of the problems that they face i found the movie hilarious especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other simply put if you are in the same wave length as these people you will find this movie amazing i don't think that this is going win any golden <UNK> or oscars or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars but its a kind of cult classic among young people who could relate to their experience for me the guy that stands out the most is hans the <UNK> guy who according to him <UNK> a <UNK> but gets all or some of the chicks the little people also play a big part in the movie especially when they are drunk if i keep going i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that just go and get the movie and you will not regret i give it a 8 10
<START> i liked it just that i liked it not like the animated series i love it the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn't like it that much there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crime fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn't a flaw <UNK> was awesome she really fit there as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin batman needed a good <UNK> not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child but <UNK> what didn't work the new artwork it isn't horrible but to me it <UNK> work in a series like batman this is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond return of the joker so this joker isn't near as good the good thing about the joker is that it still mark <UNK> voice my favorite character <UNK> quinn im in love for her they put an awesome episode for her mad love to me the best episode of this series here we finally know how she turned <UNK> quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker but too short this is how it was to be all the series but in general i didn't like how she made <UNK> in this series in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get <UNK> she say <UNK> she make flaws c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her and here they put ridiculous like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the <UNK> so in general its a good series it has it <UNK> and downs the drawn could be better my good kill that <UNK> nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes my favorites mad love <UNK> millions old wounds sins of the father and cold comfort if you enjoyed batman <UNK> you can watch this but don't <UNK> too much in the other hand if you didn't watched <UNK> watch this first and then watch <UNK> in that way you're really gonna love <UNK> d
<START> i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his <UNK> the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their <UNK> and <UNK> instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him quentin <UNK> mr <UNK> of the <UNK> is married to diane <UNK> <UNK> miss <UNK> of leave it to <UNK> fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the <UNK> and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off

<START> i got <UNK> by the title i was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism instead i got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a <UNK> <UNK> br br the leading character isn't given much psychological depth unless you are willing to <UNK> cheesy teen like poetry as psychology br br it was a shame because the core of the story could have been good with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth br br sadly the general idea seems to be more like i'm the way i am because that's the way i am and the <UNK> bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower class man makes things even worse <UNK> to the <UNK> clich√© of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a quick fix a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart artsy and meaningful br br but 16 years of alcohol isn't much smart artsy or meaningful the leading character doesn't <UNK> at all and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue br br the movie borrows heavily from classics such as a clockwork orange and <UNK> but it ultimately fails to <UNK> their greatness not even for a few seconds br br <UNK> put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain
<START> i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he <UNK> since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the fear halloween night i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and <UNK> forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people including his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first
<START> hey guys i'm actually in this movie i didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised i played pete the main characters son it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it while filming they needed me to be in two places at once so they used my twin sister as a body double the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine i still act and do some tv but not as much oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the <UNK> br br review i thought the movie was okay but if i wasn't in it it wouldn't be one of my favorites i thought the acting was really good but the story line was only so so
<START> merry <UNK> in london stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently <UNK> up her married politician father with a strong independent lady <UNK> who's never been in love intriguing early vehicle for <UNK> hepburn playing an <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> who's been too self involved to give herself over to any man the director dorothy <UNK> and the screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> who adapted gilbert <UNK> book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clich√©s kept intact like frozen <UNK> <UNK> burke plays the type of <UNK> <UNK> wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and <UNK> final scene is another <UNK> a curious <UNK> but not a classic for kate <UNK> from
<START> the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it's just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it's still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the <UNK> character turning out to be <UNK> the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn't work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children's film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn't the first time in the series it's also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10
<START> before i begin you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny <UNK> films his <UNK> series of the life of his master <UNK> <UNK> were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made as were most of his street fighter films the action was practically non stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee depending on who you ask he was the greatest martial arts <UNK> on film during the 1970s because they are so good i've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more which i am in the process of watching br br unfortunately despite my love of these films i am not a mind <UNK> zombie who <UNK> the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being <UNK> best work a score of 10 isn't a real rating it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba not this film as i said technically this film is awful some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print the camera work is simply atrocious like it was done by <UNK> smart <UNK> but still <UNK> nonetheless often much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are <UNK> off due to the <UNK> of production and again and again the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched with cuts being done <UNK> and <UNK> br br i don't know whether the musical score is original or not but it was also very very bad sort of like acid rock of 1970 <UNK> poorly with <UNK> <UNK> spaghetti western music it was annoying distracting and just plain silly br br as for the martial arts action i think that having <UNK> do the choreography would have improved things a bit instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a chiba film the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera so what you are left with is the story and this might just be the worst part of the film it's supposed to be an anti drug film starring sonny chiba as sonny chiba and when the film begins he <UNK> to destroy the drug trade in japan but the mafia complete with not a single member who looks italian but who are all japanese <UNK> to stop chiba and when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions even though she's never <UNK> about telling him what she knows in fact later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge <UNK> full of cocaine and he continues trying to protect her this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script such as when they went into the bars and <UNK> and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk br br so if it was that bad why still does it merit a 3 well first there are many more horrid marital arts films such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their <UNK> with 3 foot long <UNK> they used for fighting now that's bad second while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films compared to its <UNK> it's not that bad still you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film br br by the way if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film it certainly is not in one of his first films invasion of the <UNK> men chiba plays a <UNK> wearing super hero who battles <UNK> headed <UNK> from the planet <UNK> it's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler's brain for awfulness br br a final note to parents like most of sonny <UNK> films this one is very violent and has its share of <UNK> don't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated r martial arts films
<START> this movie has no story it's only about a bunch of guys who <UNK> an innocent young girl to death br br spoilers br br this is what they do they beat her put her in a net and let her hang inside like <UNK> spin her around on a chair until she <UNK> expose her to loud noise pour <UNK> oil on her put worms in her <UNK> crush her hand with a <UNK> hammer and finally <UNK> a <UNK> through her eye br br this movie was so realistic that if i didn't know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff movie although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it it scared me i guess it fills some kind of purpose i give it a 10 10
<START> this is simply one of the finest <UNK> of <UNK> classic tale the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story <UNK> in their presentation style of choice br br george c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development <UNK> by the visits of the ghosts i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i <UNK> with the old <UNK> something rarely done in other versions the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen
<START> this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a <UNK> parody of 1950s teenage life in an attempt to celebrate the work of <UNK> junior <UNK> officers the opening title points out that <UNK> of potential <UNK> who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed a second crime however this becomes merely a <UNK> to the following teen drama until the film's <UNK> where we are <UNK> that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such <UNK> however mixed up they might seem br br stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile <UNK> officer this hard boiled character is a role typical of baker having been currently on the trail of a notorious <UNK> known as the <UNK> and does not <UNK> the distraction of the transfer however as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigation br br his first case leads him to the home of two young children mary and patrick murphy played by real life brother and sister duo who have committed a petty <UNK> here he meets <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by anne <UNK> their older sister whom he eventually becomes <UNK> involved with it quickly becomes obvious that the <UNK> environment of such inner city <UNK> is a <UNK> ground for juvenile <UNK> br br the elder brother of the murphy family johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll <UNK> <UNK> does an eye catching turn as the <UNK> mixed up kid who owes more to the likes of marlon brando than any previous british star one is reminded of <UNK> character johnny from 'the wild <UNK> who led a leather clad gang of rebellious <UNK> in much the same way as this film's <UNK> leads his gang br br thankfully the <UNK> of earlier <UNK> crime dramas such as 'the blue <UNK> is not so apparent instead we are presented with several well drawn out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the <UNK> and the romantic interest between <UNK> and baker takes the <UNK> br br the plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes the <UNK> influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny <UNK> himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant the most <UNK> memorable piece of film however is the climatic <UNK> scene where a bunch of terrified school children including mary and patrick are held hostage at <UNK> by johnny obviously in the light of the real life <UNK> massacre this scene seems all the horrifying understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences
<START> trigger man is definitely the most boring and <UNK> movie i've ever seen in my life my <UNK> holiday videos are more fascinating br br the actors seem to be <UNK> at <UNK> com they do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner br br they walk and walk and walk through the forest there's more walking around than in all three parts of the lord of the rings together after the first hour i began to read a <UNK> <UNK> while watching trigger man along the way awful br br a total waste of time and money i'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10 since this is not possible i have to give 1 star
<START> it would require the beauty and <UNK> of shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless i'll give it a go br br as far as adaptations of hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it <UNK> the entire play still this is no guarantee for a first rate movie or even a good one usually i'm not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in hollywood today namely that movies should be at least two hours long preferably three is one that hopefully won't last long few stories are strong enough to <UNK> such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a four hour long movie and keeping it interesting is no small <UNK> but kenneth branagh pulls it off with flying colours he has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was completely <UNK> from start to finish br br the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance he manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on shakespearean <UNK> to catch the <UNK> of emotions that are <UNK> inside him kate <UNK> was a positive surprise i must say i didn't know what to expect really i've always liked her well enough as an actor but wasn't sure she could pull off playing shakespeare well she certainly <UNK> all doubts with her performance she is the best <UNK> i have seen and <UNK> such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performances are derek <UNK> as <UNK> richard <UNK> as <UNK> and nicholas farrell as <UNK> to name but a few i liked the fact that branagh used some <UNK> more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles i especially enjoyed the <UNK> between hamlet and the <UNK> played by billy crystal br br the setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually <UNK> gothic settings it is overall much lighter than other versions i've seen more colourful and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it is exceptional stylish and <UNK> pleasing a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well the music by patrick doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie one can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this i am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it wasn't even nominated there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this is as close to perfection as you can hope to get br br to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my <UNK> off to you mr branagh
<START> a huge hit upon release with australian audiences it can still be funny today but its over the top political <UNK> and blunt <UNK> humour can make it a bit of a <UNK> it goes on far too long some of br br the content could have been saved for the sequel barry <UNK> holds his own which desperately needed some new stuff anyway granted his <UNK> aussie attitude is funny but also becomes annoying as the film drags on some say <UNK> songs are the best bits and they are certainly original but hilarious the adventures of barry <UNK> will go down as a landmark in australian cinema but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of <UNK> as barry <UNK> or for that matter mick <UNK> rating 5 10
<START> i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex killing scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you haven't seen it i beg you don't bother
<START> this is not an entirely bad movie the plot new house built next door seems to be haunted is not bad the mood is creepy enough and the acting is okay the big problem i had is that being familiar with lara flynn boyle from twin peaks and other shows i couldn't get over how different she looks with her apparently new big lips i kept staring at them they look so out of place on her face they make her look completely different and not better br br mark paul <UNK> the actor who plays kim the architect who designs and <UNK> his heart and soul into the house does a fine job and lara as <UNK> is also quite good but those lips as the owner of the house next door her husband walker colin <UNK> is appropriately wooden the various characters who live in the house were also fine i particularly liked pie charlotte sullivan and her husband buddy stephen <UNK> the first people to move into the house the attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails unfortunately as the other neighbors are not particularly likable br br for some reason the director was unable to make the haunted house particularly ominous other movies such as <UNK> horror the legend of hell house manage to achieve that spooky feel but it just doesn't happen here the closest is when <UNK> paints a depiction of the house br br another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with kim the architect initially he appears to be a victim of the house like the others it has sucked him dry of inspiration but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil br br overall not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips
<START> i too was intrigued by the high 8 5 rating for this film and was very disappointed i had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row but it was not to be i went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way there is not much of a plot if any i don't necessarily need that in a movie but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in the best i could say would be that it <UNK> to be an altman <UNK> film albeit with an extremely small ensemble sure there are moments but a few moments easily get <UNK> out by <UNK> slow minutes of nothing i do not understand the high rating for this film i give it a 3 br br
<START> if you're a fan of gothic horror then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian 60's film castle of blood we're really talking about <UNK> <UNK> doors eerie <UNK> that appear to be moving <UNK> dying <UNK> although there's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors speaking in terms of atmosphere and style this masterful piece of gothic film making is one of the best out there just one tiny league below <UNK> such as black sunday the three faces of fear and curse of the crying woman the prominent directors duo sergio <UNK> the great silence <UNK> and antonio <UNK> cannibal apocalypse killer fish are successful in all areas including a powerful plot one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ultra sinister scenery and filming locations stylish black and white photography spine chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers barbara steele <UNK> of the aforementioned black sunday and italian <UNK> <UNK> number one shines <UNK> again as a <UNK> tormented character and she's literally surrounded by excellent co players one of them <UNK> <UNK> even gives away a fairly <UNK> depiction of author edgar allan poe the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside <UNK> challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid <UNK> if he ¬ñ alan foster ¬ñ would survive spending one night in the infamous <UNK> castle he receives the astonishing reward of 10 and a newspaper interview with poe needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds even for somebody like alan foster who's a firm non believer in ghosts and vampires the night starts out great for him as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams but gradually he learns that <UNK> castle is a <UNK> place where the ghosts of the previously deceased <UNK> are trapped for all eternity i don't know about you but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time co director antonio <UNK> clearly was proud of this film as well because he remade it himself a couple of years later as web of the spider that movie had a handful of <UNK> like for example the casting of no less than <UNK> kinski in the role of edgar allan poe but in general this original is vastly superior castle of blood literally <UNK> with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances watch it late at night preferably alone and in a candle lit room and you'll get an idea about the true definition of horror
<START> woody <UNK> and wesley snipes team up as <UNK> on the basketball court okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film this movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by woody <UNK> played one of my favorite t v characters woody from cheers and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie but after seeing his acting performance i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country <UNK> who <UNK> his acting was as dull and poor as the movie another actor in this unreal film was <UNK> <UNK> i have liked movies with <UNK> before but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines do the right thing but now in white men can't jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice so after seeing this film term used loosely and hearing <UNK> <UNK> for much more than appreciated i can now say that i'm a white man and i'm getting ready to jump off a twenty story apartment building
<START> a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been <UNK> by a movie studio to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts i'd ever read would be a bold understatement yet i never told him this why because in a world where films like while she was out can be green <UNK> and attract an oscar winning star like kim basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell br br as so many other reviewers have pointed out while she was out is a dreadfully under written woman in peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely <UNK> on christmas eve every <UNK> is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw dropping <UNK> of logic but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise here are a couple of things that struck me br br 1 i don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house is a mess with toys since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves br br 2 <UNK> diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood where they are usually the only <UNK> balanced groups on screen br br 3 sure the film is stupid but so are the countless thrillers i've sat through where the women are portrayed as <UNK> helpless victims of male <UNK> stupid or not i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her <UNK> br br 4 i loved the ending br br 5 though an earlier reviewer <UNK> this phrase i really do think this film should be <UNK> the red <UNK> of doom
<START> el <UNK> directed by <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> and based on the novel by <UNK> <UNK> offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a <UNK> author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the <UNK> of the war in <UNK> to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a <UNK> lost in the countryside br br we first meet three boys that are playing happily not everything is what it seems the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed the boys have <UNK> a young girl about their age from taking part in their games br br when we meet the adult <UNK> again he is on his way to a <UNK> he seems to be suffering from <UNK> to his surprise <UNK> <UNK> one of his <UNK> friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that <UNK> their health care it is obvious that <UNK> looks at <UNK> in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully their relationship will have devastating consequences br br roger <UNK> does a good job with portraying the older <UNK> bruno <UNK> makes an impression as <UNK> the vulnerable youth <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> with conviction angela <UNK> puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution simon <UNK> is perfect as <UNK> br br el <UNK> is a dark film that clearly shows <UNK> <UNK> talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
<START> i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing return to paradise which i found to be gritty i was so disappointed the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from return to paradise br br maybe i was expecting too much br br on the positive side danes beckinsale and <UNK> were fantastic in their roles although i didnt like <UNK> character and first and found her very annoying br br i <UNK> see anything realistic about the film it could of been done so much better for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror it was too <UNK> a movie to be realistic there could also of been more action and tension br br the best thing about this film is the tragic ending i <UNK> of predicted that but by that time i really didnt care what happened to them br br 3 10
<START> i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's it <UNK> me also fugitive movies a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland however the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time as i see many people say that this is like a tv movie not exactly firstly there are much more better tv movies in this genre secondly tv movies might be very fun sometimes but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time it is not stylish at all visually and the most important the tone of the movie is unappealing this is not an action movie there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash also they are not big action scenes but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie the love affair between douglas and <UNK> was very unnecessary besides the assassination plot to the president is the most clich√© story in this genre either but they insist on that and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be although douglas is very old now he has still potential for acting in an action thriller in the film michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones for example sutherland is a wrong choice either because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie eva longoria parker is a strange choice of course she is too passive or straight in this movie because she is a soap opera actress the movie was not fun even one second to me so i could not get over for a while
<START> this superior <UNK> to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i can't believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was <UNK> disappointed was everyone on drugs from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is
<START> i acquired this one of my all time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me away br br i am a massive fan of <UNK> <UNK> and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the will you track it's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth this rates second best to <UNK> which also starred phil daniels br br a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the <UNK> years of the grim 80's in which i grew up the ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film i am like a <UNK> baby br br i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing i can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alone br br <UNK> sorry to hear about your dad darling god bless you all <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the <UNK> were so angry with this movie and with the <UNK> oh and it's from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies i liked host but not my absolute favorite some of my favorite sci fi fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste <UNK> stardust <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> matrix resident evil series lotr stargate dark city br br it wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great there are some holes in the story but didn't really matter i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters the korean legend was interesting the reincarnation stuff was different and i thought the main characters <UNK> dressed like korean actors in other shows <UNK> <UNK> hair looked so asian br br yes it could be better and i hope in the future that korea with its unusual quirky sense of life intense emotions and unexpected humor can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future
<START> this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen the fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse br br i had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before i started watching but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce <UNK> <UNK> character matt into the <UNK> scene br br but the film throws up <UNK> after <UNK> to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before br br let's clear up a few things <UNK> don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run of the mill league game they don't set out to kill each other they don't only wear stone island and others in the crowd <UNK> or not do they most certainly don't when having taken exception to a new firm member <UNK> off to their rival <UNK> territory for pie and mash and i'd love to meet the <UNK> who would go and grass on his <UNK> top boy to the rival firm although you can scratch what i said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist br br don't get me wrong i'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy <UNK> but this is on a par with the firm for <UNK> br br i found it <UNK> that <UNK> american nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when this is part and <UNK> of the british <UNK> scene the film chooses not to challenge <UNK> morals and instead <UNK> clear of any of the firm using coke br br i could go on but i think i've made my point br br as for the plot it's highly unimaginative and i'm sure if i hadn't spent the entire film <UNK> the points and more made above then i would have guessed what was going on sooner than i did and believe me i was well in front br br i get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men with the hope that women will enjoy the <UNK> of emotional issues that are raised br br if i'm right then the makers have failed completely it's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene and i can't believe the kind of female who looks for <UNK> films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent <UNK> br br are there any good points maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed but i'm rarely impressed by slow mo action certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a <UNK> is rousing enough anyway br br there are some funny if unrealistic moments <UNK> trip to school did raise a smile for me but a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're british avoid like the plague if only not to further develop <UNK> of the scene if you're not in the know if you're american you may enjoy it as it's clearly <UNK> to the market but no one can deny the plot is flimsy predictable and ultimately over the top
<START> a text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house but i think the more apt word is <UNK> good grief what <UNK> these two babes are br br george seymour <UNK> is alone in his san francisco office and his <UNK> expensive home in <UNK> while his wife and child are away in san diego two girls sondra locke as jackson and <UNK> camp as donna knock on his door asking directions well it's <UNK> and they're <UNK> like two <UNK> pitiful <UNK> and they're not sure of the address they're looking for and what with one thing and another george invites them to come in and <UNK> of his pizza by the fire all three of them wind up in <UNK> bath <UNK> and there follows about five minutes of mostly <UNK> nudity in double exposure triple exposure <UNK> exposure and <UNK> exposure they spend the night in a <UNK> and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast but something has gotten slightly <UNK> because <UNK> guests <UNK> everything down with their fingers and pour <UNK> and <UNK> all over the <UNK> and you eat like animals george <UNK> and tells them to get out in his dreams br br now don't get me wrong sondra locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with <UNK> blue eyes and <UNK> camp <UNK> around like a <UNK> you gotta say they breed 'em mighty cute down there in <UNK> <UNK> where locke comes from and they breed 'em with <UNK> <UNK> too as we can't help but note after the first five or ten minutes br br but when the girls go <UNK> so does the movie the film is thereafter <UNK> in a <UNK> green light the pair put on <UNK> makeup and make <UNK> faces at themselves in the mirrors they brain a delivery boy and then <UNK> him to make sure they <UNK> up a storm and smash windows and furniture they have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another <UNK> food and then jumping each other's bones br br and <UNK> they first render <UNK> unconscious with <UNK> which contains nothing that you can't find in that little red bottle of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in your kitchen <UNK> tie him up pour <UNK> and milk all over him subject him to a psychotic trial put him through one of those <UNK> type semi <UNK> slap him around dress up in outlandish costumes then <UNK> out on him and his virtually destroyed upper middle class home and are <UNK> by a delivery van ex <UNK> br br as for the acting it's as if someone had told <UNK> first act polite to these girls then act <UNK> after you're tied up and to the girls first act shy unwilling to <UNK> on anyone then act crazy and that's it br br the photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie i'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill it takes effort and talent to turn san francisco ugly the score gives us two <UNK> <UNK> is some pop tune with lyrics about being free and giving in jackson and <UNK> is a catchy <UNK> <UNK> thing called my good old dad br br i <UNK> of the moral lesson behind the story though there are some things you should simply not give in to even though they might look like a lot of fun at first all very educational
<START> this comment does contain spoilers br br there are few actors that have an <UNK> to them that <UNK> quality which is an <UNK> of charisma <UNK> and <UNK> it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at <UNK> subtle touches in scenes like his one word good bye to andy garcia in <UNK> 11 when they just utter each other's name <UNK> terry danny you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room <UNK> scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and <UNK> list of actors who exudes that terrific <UNK> in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline <UNK> in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name you can see that there is no <UNK> an actor working today i don't mention all of this to <UNK> that man on fire is perfect just because of <UNK> work but he is definitely the <UNK> of the production i was literally <UNK> with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and <UNK> all at the same time br br washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those <UNK> government <UNK> he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become <UNK> with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left <UNK> and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very <UNK> by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service <UNK> needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel <UNK> mitchell is <UNK> sexy as his wife lisa and <UNK> fanning is just unbelievably and <UNK> brilliant as pita i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the film's entire first half is <UNK> on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional <UNK> would not have come across so <UNK> but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role br br it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the <UNK> of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual <UNK> has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be <UNK> to icon status br br the story has creasy really taking to pita and <UNK> <UNK> versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it <UNK> from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a <UNK> and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her <UNK> stories and she is <UNK> her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them it is more of a <UNK> and a deep <UNK> love seems to be present br br the film changes <UNK> when pita does get kidnapped and held for <UNK> and creasy is is almost <UNK> injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and <UNK> with <UNK> as the plot pieces get <UNK> like an <UNK> and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like <UNK> tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it <UNK> in him as he <UNK> down and <UNK> out his brand of <UNK> <UNK> anger and <UNK> are <UNK> and not easily <UNK> as he <UNK> down each person responsible for <UNK> <UNK> this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind br br also what is paramount to this film's <UNK> brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due <UNK> i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they <UNK> all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian <UNK> sees to it that <UNK> here is <UNK> and it is painful the <UNK> here feel <UNK> wrath and they experience the torment that he <UNK> there is nothing <UNK> about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a <UNK> bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film br br man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 10 10
<START> national lampoon was once a funny magazine whether you liked the <UNK> hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke head days of the seventies when the comedy was <UNK> with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth but everyone agrees that by the early eighties middle age had killed off <UNK> remaining sparks of <UNK> humour that the drugs hadn't and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin off records shot further holes in the <UNK> outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence there's absolutely nothing to recommend this <UNK> depressing <UNK> if you make it through the <UNK> opening segment <UNK> <UNK> hoping things will get better tough luck they don't whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of <UNK> was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a <UNK> of dog mess if there's ever a global <UNK> of guitar picks the <UNK> of this rambling incoherent <UNK> of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related items br br no wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivel br br how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious <UNK> belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on br br how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at that br br anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs
<START> there is only one problem with this website you can't give a negative rating additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie i say he was being too nice a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire this is absolutely terrible 2 hours of life that anyone who <UNK> this <UNK> bloodbath will never get back after watching 5 minutes myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk <UNK> would make this anymore entertaining half a <UNK> and a bottle of <UNK> later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything <UNK> from this more he should go and buy a rope and to the actors in this flick i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 <UNK> points off your acting <UNK>
<START> the leap years is a movie adapted from an e <UNK> by <UNK> writer catherine <UNK> which became the first <UNK> novel <UNK> to be sold over the internet the film had a <UNK> post production schedule shot in early 2005 it was <UNK> for release at the end of 2005 but only turn up eventually 3 years later on the <UNK> <UNK> 2008 a leap year br br before i say anything i must first admit i'm no fan of the romance genre so i may be a little biased against this film i watched it merely because it was a <UNK> production and that it's available for <UNK> at my neighborhood library here's my two cents on the movie br br let's just start by saying that other than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and wong li lin everybody here of note seems to be a <UNK> the love interest is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> trio of buddies are all er <UNK> <UNK> does this film <UNK> the stereotype that falling in love and <UNK> with <UNK> are more in than the common chinese or whatever asian race you are i don't know it sure seems that way also everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical <UNK> accent which doesn't exist anywhere certainly not in <UNK> it's the kind of semi perfect english that authorities would like us speak but which doesn't exist anywhere outside say the mtv channel the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted not helped by the lack of true blue <UNK> in the cast br br the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one liners after one liners after twenty minutes the wit of the movie starts to <UNK> and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clich√©s br br i guess i didn't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of <UNK> a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable br br there are other <UNK> in the film i can't for one believe that <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> wu would fall for one of <UNK> girlfriends and the scene where the <UNK> says go before i change my mind has been used in a hundred east asian korean chinese hong kong <UNK> etc tv serials br br so 4 stars for this film the production value is fair and wong li lin tries her best but she's not helped by the script joan <UNK> has a 15 minute bit part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot but hey her role is just cameo br br if you come across the leap years in the rental or library you may want to pop it in the dvd player for <UNK> sake but otherwise for people who don't exactly enjoy the romance genre you can decide whether or not to give it a miss
<START> what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed <UNK> <UNK> film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since <UNK> remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their <UNK> formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of <UNK> matter is absurd i am by no means a <UNK> and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's 80's but this is inferior product even by the <UNK> standards of the then illegal <UNK> loop
<START> the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited <UNK> ever written br br i first saw this movie back in 1978 <UNK> when i first <UNK> to cable in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in <UNK> br br this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early 1980's i received a free month of the star channel with my new cable <UNK> the van was one of the movies that was in heavy <UNK> on that network at that time br br i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flick along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties br br i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere 4 99 br br seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was is however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now 30 years later br br it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking <UNK> and having sex in the back a fancy van often all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should be br br there isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character <UNK> about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college <UNK> money to purchase a tricked out dodge van with <UNK> carpet walls <UNK> ceiling and a water bed in it to get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their <UNK> he and his arch rival end up <UNK> both of their <UNK> and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a <UNK> lesser attractive girl that he half ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier better off and the movie ends br br the movie does have it's funny moments but watching this movie 30 years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it also brought back memories of <UNK> around a small town while we <UNK> pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes i'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the <UNK> <UNK> i also remember many of the songs in this move when they were new this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memories br br the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized <UNK> were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i don't young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the 70's self included wanting a <UNK> <UNK> am chevy <UNK> or a hot rod ford <UNK> but never a van this movie makes it appear as if <UNK> were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one which just wasn't true of that era
<START> the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes br br the plot is basically about a group of national guard <UNK> who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated <UNK> on their last day of training in the desert it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is <UNK> thrown in to shock the audience br br i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if you're bored and nothing else br br 4 10
<START> robert <UNK> does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines <UNK> tone and alan curtis and he does it i might add without a lot of help from his male actors i e curtis and tone it's raines all the way a pretty <UNK> actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her noir counterparts br br <UNK> use of sex light shadows and music is truly remarkable as he <UNK> this genre the shadows lighting effects and camera angles are all effective but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook <UNK> on by an excited raines it's this scene that brings phantom lady into new territory br br <UNK> commitment to the material is matched only by raines who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man <UNK> tone <UNK> this one in alan curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived and he never except for a brief moment in prison seemed to be in love with raines br br the amusing thing about many of these films is that as world war ii progressed interest in <UNK> <UNK> but often the terms were used <UNK> in films such as possessed <UNK> and the greatest show on earth tone is called paranoid by thomas <UNK> tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder but he appears to be closer to a psychopath in <UNK> as <UNK> by his <UNK> he may have had a brain <UNK> pushing against his brain br br phantom lady doesn't have the greatest plot but it's well worth watching
<START> this is a clever episode of twilight zone that was comic rather than strange or tragic buster keaton is <UNK> <UNK> a janitor from <UNK> america works in a laboratory he is constantly <UNK> about the life problems around him meat is too expensive it's like 1 00 <UNK> <UNK> of he is always yelling after crazy <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> haven't appeared yet <UNK> to the end he sees a helmet like device by a scientist and puts it on and tries it suddenly he is in modern america the beginning was a seven minute silent film now it is all noise all talking all <UNK> all blowing keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better he runs into stanley adams a professor <UNK> who realizes that <UNK> is from c <UNK> he mentions president cleveland <UNK> has always wanted to live in that charming quiet age he helps <UNK> get the helmet <UNK> and they go back in time <UNK> gets bored after awhile due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use <UNK> puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future but now <UNK> is fully content with the quiet simple age he lives in he has found <UNK> br br in his last fifteen years buster keaton was frequently on television many times for allan <UNK> on <UNK> camera where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public he did make a few films as well most notably a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and the <UNK> but he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes he is in his element here presumably <UNK> the director old comedy film director norman <UNK> he directed the marx brothers in horse <UNK> on the tricks he could do watch how stanley adams and he time adams picking him up when he is <UNK> a pair of <UNK> he needs in terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the <UNK> in films like sherlock jr the episode does show keaton in fine <UNK> for a man in his sixties br br the appearances of jesse white here as a <UNK> of all things is always welcome but look a bit at professor <UNK> stanley adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s <UNK> to his tragic suicide in 1977 <UNK> with <UNK> appearance and heavy <UNK> voice his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling <UNK> in the film version of <UNK> for a <UNK> he wants anthony quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an indian his best known television appearance was as the space <UNK> who introduces the crew of the starship enterprise in star trek to those <UNK> <UNK> little creatures <UNK> as in the trouble with adams was always worth watching like jesse white and certainly like keaton <UNK> most of the productions he appeared in i have never understood his suicide but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer
<START> <UNK> is a very interesting movie it is an <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and failures the central concept is great three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth who the audience identify with and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell br br the atmosphere is well woven it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> prior to becoming the count of <UNK> <UNK> the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell particularly the character we are meant to identify with <UNK> a white collar criminal whose crime is not <UNK> but it's <UNK> suggested might be fraud on one occasion <UNK> <UNK> when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell the <UNK> is <UNK> there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall so even though the film appears to be very modern it has a very old world feel of <UNK> br br the characters are intriguing we have marcus a violent pre <UNK> <UNK> who plays an abusive mother to <UNK> french for daisy a heavily retarded young man <UNK> likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and unfortunately this included his baby sister hence his current <UNK> i like this comment on <UNK> very primitive <UNK> is a <UNK> possessed elderly man in for brutally murdering his wife br br the central message of the movie is that your desires will <UNK> you and there's a ritual that goes with that i think that's what <UNK> me the most seeing people destroying themselves <UNK> it has a real life ring to it the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well every step deeper into the <UNK> is accompanied by the dull <UNK> of a <UNK> i'm actually hearing the <UNK> now every time i do something self destructive br br i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really <UNK> the message consistently particularly with <UNK> also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film not in terms of a <UNK> revelation either i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish more by design than execution such as the famous <UNK> eye and the <UNK> of <UNK> for me totally hollow images br br at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with and some things don't seem logical for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about <UNK> child this doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird a pure horror movie there is no comedic <UNK> or genre <UNK> like cube 1997 natali the obvious movie to compare it to it's a total <UNK> experience where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters this last comment i make about it being a pure experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly <UNK> point br br on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when <UNK> talks about his past as a <UNK> he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him the books seem to be <UNK> to him that he will never contain their knowledge this <UNK> <UNK> to go insane that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge it's something i myself have felt br br one final comment is that two of the quite well received comments on the board have confused the characters' names to convince yourself that <UNK> is the older <UNK> character simply click on <UNK> <UNK> page and you will see he was born in 1936
<START> what a weekend two days ago i watched the first half of war games 2 dead code now while she was out i am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching i guess while she was out was worse br br it has all been said before in other comments unrealistic illogical etc the only thing i really have to add is that at some point i started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because i would have recommended her for a <UNK> award if she actually died only watched first half so i don't know soon i was at two <UNK> awards if that's even possible for her immense stupidity br br and hey produced by kim basinger so she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us the people i consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and <UNK> quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent which are idiots a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are
<START> after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or whether the cinema sound system may be <UNK> for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background <UNK> music and the <UNK> of the sound track i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so it was the director br br i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film these days directors will go to many <UNK> to make their film unique unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same br br so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film which you can find out for yourself elsewhere the sound track <UNK> are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss you will only hear the distorted <UNK> of the sound track and certainly not a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ok i saw this movie to get a <UNK> for bad but with this movie it's <UNK> best movie now plot luc <UNK> is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him to <UNK> and perfect the <UNK> program in an effort to make a new stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated intelligent and <UNK> all of the new <UNK> which are faster and stronger than their predecessors are connected through an <UNK> intelligent computer system called seth a self <UNK> thought <UNK> when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is <UNK> to be shut down because of budget cuts he takes matters into his own hands to protect himself killing those who try to shut off his power and <UNK> his platoon of super soldiers led by the <UNK> romeo seth <UNK> <UNK> only because <UNK> has the secret code that is needed to <UNK> a built in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours with the help of a <UNK> named <UNK> seth takes human form not only must luc <UNK> with ambitious reporter <UNK> who won't leave his side but luc also must <UNK> with general <UNK> who wants to take extreme <UNK> to stop seth seth has also kidnapped <UNK> injured 13 year old daughter <UNK> and is now holding her hostage luc is the only person who can rescue <UNK> because luc knows <UNK> how a <UNK> thinks feels and fights now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just so happened to be there and the soldiers can take being <UNK> with a truck however when <UNK> damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is <UNK> stronger and faster than any other <UNK> and luc can take a hit from him with the final fight when luc <UNK> him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and <UNK> him terminator 2 another thing that bugs me is how the hell does <UNK> damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of <UNK> damme it's completely off the <UNK> of how science fiction this movie is the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a <UNK> with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that the good points are there's no dolph <UNK> and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many i'm still haunted by the scenes in 1 also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were <UNK> if you don't believe me look it up
<START> being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb br br it's your basic <UNK> done it ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard br br to me it was worth watching more than once so i'll give it an 8 on imdb
<START> religious <UNK> is rampant everywhere australia is not <UNK> to it br br a <UNK> <UNK> a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby i don't mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the <UNK> before getting <UNK> deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison br br buy or rent the movie and discover how deep <UNK> human hatred of those who are different continues to <UNK> around the globe br br this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors br br both meryl streep with her famous aussie accent and sam <UNK> whose accent is his native born <UNK> are outstanding those with supporting roles are also quite good br br you will remember this movie for many years br br see it
<START> firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it <UNK> perfectly timed slapstick sexual humour and cleverly thought up stand up but it goes deeper than that the <UNK> opposite is an original love story something we don't see that often that gave me hope that there is love out there that two people who love each other can work through their <UNK> and that such a comedic take on life something i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris <UNK> gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future
<START> the first 45 minutes of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable the characters are believable and interesting the <UNK> lab looks really high tech after that it all <UNK> the characters start behaving <UNK> and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a <UNK> <UNK> and this is supposedly present day going critical the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon only it doesn't the finish is incredibly weak one wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong br br all the characters except dean cain are played by russians this results in some weird situations and details like the character being played by <UNK> <UNK> being called <UNK> kent despite her heavy accent and despite her on one occasion inexplicably switching to spanish br br because of the decent start i considered rating this movie a 5 but it really was more disappointing than that so i only give it 4

<START> this movie is awesome sort of it <UNK> really say much or do much but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is the high school is taken over by evil ms <UNK> that hates the one thing that all the students love rock roll riff <UNK> get everyone tickets for the ramones show and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff <UNK> the ramones this movie has everything a bad script questionable directing bad actors ie clint howard p j soles an awesome soundtrack extreme <UNK> these elements much more come together to make this what it is a classic br br note during the live ramones set notice that <UNK> crash of the <UNK> is in the front of the crowd neat o
<START> i'm a big fan of <UNK> having caught on only at the end of season three i <UNK> watched all the previous seasons when it was <UNK> <UNK> that it was one of the most well thought out story <UNK> to ever hit television even the filler episodes were interesting the movies also were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters br br which brings us to <UNK> of <UNK> naturally after seeing everything else i had high expectations martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci fi story the story itself might have looked good in outline form even made it to the story board however it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out had this made the regular season it would have rated among the worst of the episodes
<START> the <UNK> version of robert altman's short cuts set in the small rural town of <UNK> the episodes present a <UNK> of the eternal events problems and emotions of human life joy and love deception and <UNK> <UNK> and death i was particularly impressed by two episodes the first is the story of the young waitress who tries to stir up a romance for his co workers she <UNK> an overwhelming joy of love and life the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the <UNK> practices of the hospital and their loneliness <UNK> with the routines of the hospital crew despite the signs of occasional empathy compared with altman's classic this movie is perhaps less professional but it is definitely a great piece of art
<START> joseph brady and clarence <UNK> are two sailors who have a four day shore leave in hollywood joe knows everything about girls and can't wait to see lola while clarence is <UNK> and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls they then run into a little boy donald martin who has ran away in order to join the navy they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan who wants to be a singer clarence wants <UNK> to be his girl but his <UNK> gets in the way but he doesn't feel shy with a waitress who comes from brooklyn like he does soon joe notices he's in love with <UNK> the boys are in a fix when they lie to <UNK> on meeting with a big time music producer they don't even know as they are in a fix with their feelings george <UNK> anchors aweigh 1945 is a great musical comedy gene kelly is top notch once again in his singing and dancing routines frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra but he plays his part well kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan <UNK> we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of <UNK> the 9 year old dean <UNK> does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor jose iturbi does great job performing himself it's magic what he does with the piano edgar kennedy plays chief of police station sara <UNK> is the voice of jerry mouse there's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers just look at kelly and sinatra performing we hate to leave it's so energetic if you knew <UNK> like i know <UNK> is quite funny it's a nice moment when frank sings <UNK> <UNK> to little dean <UNK> it's lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango jealousy the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse also tom cat is seen there as the butler they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused the movie was nominated for five oscars but <UNK> <UNK> got one for original music score anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment
<START> when i first saw this movie it was titled terror on a train and was the back half of a double feature glenn ford an <UNK> expert is called on to <UNK> a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high <UNK> the tension is slow and steady and this black white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes all these years later on tv the tension and drama has lost most of its impact this is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go br br along with ford are anne <UNK> and maurice <UNK> the villain <UNK> is played by victor <UNK>
<START> then you'd better not watch this movie they've completely ruined the premise of the show in the movie the duke boys are idiots daisy is <UNK> <UNK> is sinister boss <UNK> is capable uncle jessie is a criminal only <UNK> and flash are true to the original characters at least <UNK> is kinda close br br at one point they open the doors to get into the general lee <UNK> said br br the original show may not have been great tv but it was entertaining and the characters made sense this movie is like dumb dumber meets the simple life

<START> i was interested in the title and description of big <UNK> while attending the <UNK> film festival in austin <UNK> however i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big <UNK> ended big <UNK> is comprised of several big <UNK> drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states the characters are all wonderful people however the filmmakers never <UNK> deep into the complexity of them as people instead the story <UNK> as much as the <UNK> in the film are meant to guide but never do at most we get lost we the audience end up going nowhere and like the direction of the storytelling end up somewhere but without direction location or plot why are we here where are we how did we get here the storytelling is sloppy and the <UNK> intent on <UNK> a group of people who they regard as overlooked and invisible comes across as <UNK> and <UNK> condescending the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers the directors bring their own naive <UNK> about <UNK> forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those <UNK> overall the story lacks any tension the film is entirely too long should have been a 15 min sketch the big question of so what is never answered and the entire film is one piece of see through propaganda that does nothing to further <UNK> as the directors claim the outside world about big <UNK>
<START> six <UNK> about to be send home and <UNK> get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia surrounded by <UNK> figures two male dancers pretend to have a fight behind them on an <UNK> a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake finally biting one of the dancers on the neck the imitation snake is dressed in some <UNK> looking body <UNK> this is definitely a female imitation snake the cult member who has <UNK> them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the <UNK> must not be interrupted and most definitely no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed naturally the <UNK> take a flash photo send the cult members into an angry <UNK> steal the basket containing the snake and run off with it into the asian night br br one of the guys the most offensive and <UNK> dies from a <UNK> bite on the neck though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room br br back in new york it all seems rather old news as the <UNK> men settle down into their <UNK> lives still maintaining their bond with one another their jobs range from manager of a <UNK> alley david <UNK> to graduate research student richard long james <UNK> jack kelly and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood richard long has a nice blond girl friend kelly is a somewhat reckless <UNK> but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy br br then a dark <UNK> looking mysterious woman faith <UNK> shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and <UNK> her into the group br br guess what happens first <UNK> is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash then kelly gets a visit from <UNK> something scares him so badly he <UNK> through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk long and <UNK> begin to suspect what the viewer already knows that <UNK> has had something to do with the deaths they also <UNK> that maybe she's turning into a <UNK> which is the case <UNK> confronts her with his <UNK> and she proves his point br br by this time long and thompson are thoroughly <UNK> particularly thompson who is in love with <UNK> and has discovered that she is attracted to him too although he must explain to her what love is no matter a final reckless attack by the <UNK> woman against <UNK> girl friend not one of the six original <UNK> and thompson must throw the snake out the window on the <UNK> below the body changes to that of <UNK> the end br br i think i'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises i'll just mention one of the more <UNK> ones in passing who paid for <UNK> fare from somewhere in asia to new york who's paying her <UNK> bills in the hotel who paid for her spectacular wardrobe how come she speaks american english so well what the <UNK> going on the writers and director have clearly seen some of val <UNK> modest horror films and though not much effort has gone into this production they've <UNK> stolen some gimmicks from <UNK> in <UNK> the cat people for instance the woman is transformed into a black <UNK> but with one tiny exception the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it most of the <UNK> here use shadows too but unlike <UNK> the shadows are clumsy and <UNK> br br <UNK> also made occasional use of what he called <UNK> <UNK> first bus was a literal one a potential victim is <UNK> alone through the dark <UNK> of central park with only the sound of footsteps something or someone is following her she <UNK> with fright under a street <UNK> something <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> above her she looks <UNK> there is a loud <UNK> <UNK> that makes your hair stand on end it's a bus using its air <UNK> to stop for her the producers used at least two <UNK> in this film and they amount to nothing a guy is walking <UNK> across an <UNK> for instance and there is the sudden <UNK> of a truck that almost hits him there is no set up to the shot it's <UNK> in with a shoe horn br br i don't much care for movies that <UNK> the stereotype of <UNK> as slimy ugly <UNK> and <UNK> as a matter of fact no snakes are slimy most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful furthermore they're more feminine than <UNK> in their <UNK> movements and <UNK> approach to goals you want a <UNK> symbol for <UNK> try a six <UNK> <UNK> it's a really fast lizard when it sees something to eat it rushes up and <UNK> it down br br anyway if you want to see some fine low budget scary films don't bother with this one find the cat people or one of <UNK> other minor masterpieces of which this is an obvious copy
<START> the comedic might of <UNK> and <UNK> couldn't save this dog from the <UNK> thin plot weak script dismal acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together it has a very few memorable moments but the well <UNK> up quickly as a kid i remember this as a luke warm vehicle for the two actor comedians but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall watching it again after many years it screams schlock a <UNK> i'm not so concerned with the racial controversy as i wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little <UNK> the most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a <UNK> non related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits any not very good ones at that that were <UNK> together by the editor after an all <UNK> at the local <UNK> hole characters change feelings and motivations on a dime without rhyme nor reason between scenes and within scenes making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay not that it was any gem to start with i feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made maybe my sense of humor has become too <UNK>
<START> this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the bar br br the film is quite frankly boring what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it the film <UNK> itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing <UNK> and makes it look like a student film did i say it was boring already if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional <UNK> to any of them br br there are about 4 good minutes in this movie but that was about it this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance but i held on believing that it had to get better i was wrong br br the sort of film you could <UNK> naughty children with
<START> first of all in defense of joan fontaine it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as <UNK> the young british lady who has the title role fontaine makes a <UNK> picture as the heroine here but her acting <UNK> shows badly and her dancing is better left <UNK> fortunately she went on to better things br br but here it's fred astaire george burns and <UNK> allen who get the top billing and they are excellent fans of burns allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into <UNK> dance routines especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer <UNK> pans an oscar they join astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight br br unfortunately not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic <UNK> that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment only the musical <UNK> give the story the lift it needs br br some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve the nice supporting cast includes <UNK> <UNK> at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> love as <UNK> father mistaken as a <UNK> by astaire br br it's a lighthearted romp whenever burns allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days both of them are surprisingly <UNK> in keeping up with <UNK> <UNK> br br director george stevens makes sure that joan <UNK> <UNK> dance number with fred is filmed at a <UNK> distance but clever camera work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as <UNK> dance partner something she seems painfully aware of
<START> that's what the title should be anyway br br this movie combines guns <UNK> and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie let me make my point in a series of questions answers type deal br br what happens in the movie people die br br is that it yes br br what is the plot about what plot br br what is the point the movie is trying to make killing is the only solution br br what are the characters like extremely flawed and <UNK> toward their own personalities br br is there anything good about this movie yes i'm sure they used some nice <UNK> cameras in filming it br br if you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie if you happen to be <UNK> by such low standard entertainment then made men is not for you br br to sum it up the <UNK> stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely <UNK> and nothing fits together br br this proves one thing the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't made
<START> i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons for the first half hour it's actually pretty decent although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as <UNK> <UNK> another recent <UNK> film which turned out to be much much better than i expected the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in <UNK> society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in the <UNK> republic unfortunately i don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they <UNK> butchered the <UNK> <UNK> they had before them about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are <UNK> after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating <UNK> not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's but the whole plot just goes down the drain the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners to top it all off and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert it all turns out to be a dream oh my who didn't see that coming oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie well after about an hour into it i start thinking <UNK> something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be <UNK> then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95 br br when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art perhaps a comedy to match <UNK> <UNK> or an action flick to match <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an animation as <UNK> was to japan a witty crime thriller as <UNK> cake was to england or a <UNK> awakening journey as waking life had here in the states br br i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of dr search los <UNK> and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> compelling and innovative at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic citizen kane the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly <UNK> parallel but the viewing public is too often <UNK> into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies in citizen kane charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his <UNK> much like whoopi goldberg in this movie this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences it is an epic examination of the fear of <UNK> and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self <UNK> whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex <UNK> a <UNK> for the ages with the only <UNK> comparisons being <UNK> and bacall hepburn and tracy and hall and <UNK> if you would love to watch an uplifting celluloid philosophical examination of some of <UNK> deepest drives bergman <UNK> but not as depressing theodore rex should be viewed immediately
<START> this particular episode of <UNK> is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of it's roots it <UNK> back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the <UNK> <UNK> office in metropolis this room hasn't been in <UNK> for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the <UNK> past not to mention <UNK> conversations with lex are always admirable br br another pleasant return is well <UNK> guessed it is bart allen aka <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> and victor stone aka cyborg not only does steven <UNK> reunite the former justice <UNK> he <UNK> them in with the <UNK> formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie br br from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 33 1 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and <UNK> with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new <UNK> true to the justice league character br br the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven <UNK> directed was <UNK> from season 4 this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark <UNK> at the end we didn't find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve <UNK> redeemed himself in this justice episode br br i had a few <UNK> about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the <UNK> facility <UNK> i mean it would have been <UNK> much <UNK> if say green arrow and cyborg took off on <UNK> bike <UNK> from the arrow episode clark and <UNK> should have obviously ran and <UNK> should have <UNK> via another route but that was <UNK> incredibly cheesy it <UNK> off 2 points from the full 10 br br secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow <UNK> let's go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do <UNK> the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in <UNK> history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6 br br 7 out of 10
<START> few movies have <UNK> expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a <UNK> in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the <UNK> controversy the <UNK> would have been more <UNK> br br now that i've got my distress out of my system i am more able to <UNK> the movie br br from the <UNK> the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start <UNK> in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it <UNK> its international audiences by over <UNK> it watching the character of the domestic help <UNK> in perfect english is too unreal to be true br br next we get regular glimpses into <UNK> dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and <UNK> the flow of the movie i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the <UNK> was lost br br the love scenes felt <UNK> and are probably meant for audience <UNK> rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the two br br the names chosen for the women <UNK> and <UNK> are names of <UNK> <UNK> and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place the shock through name selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd br br the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject br br the acting felt wooden although <UNK> <UNK> brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that <UNK> <UNK> was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbish br br in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please
<START> made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the <UNK> film festival it was well shot from the outset but that's the last positive comment i have about the film the acting was awful i wonder if actual <UNK> girls were hired but it was the plot that was truly laughable in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason i gave this 3 10 br br spoilers below br br i just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing br br <UNK> the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid <UNK> another kid could be acted so badly a real eye opener br br the getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus but according to the music the world is ending br br the rolling under the clothes line wow this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills in the room followed by raw meat and skill selling why not just get her to perform all three <UNK> at once at least then the film might have been slightly shorter br br the running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating <UNK> no wait she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nails br br the running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene and a fitting end to the movie a half marathon in red paint completed by <UNK> up stairs and over the bridge only to be sent flying most <UNK> by a passing car not only this but this suicide is <UNK> by the most self obsessed girl in the film now that's sticking to character for you br br i'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates sadly having met the director at the presentation this is not the case br br but if you're in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with a few mates then still don't even think about it
<START> and i'll tell you why whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill advised everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up how do they do it you might ask well they don't do it very well that's for sure anyway instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession they are said to have <UNK> still the characters go around in a <UNK> of marijuana smoke <UNK> others along their way with no explanation whatsoever
<START> wilson <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation <UNK> the directing debut of jonathan <UNK> after writing and producing a few of mentor roger <UNK> new world films <UNK> was <UNK> the opportunity to direct for the first time and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence but has an appealing tongue in cheek quality to it as well it's often as funny as it is flashy br br standout scenes include a <UNK> and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners as well as a potent dream fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed <UNK> mcqueen horror icon barbara steele doing a marvelous turn in this <UNK> role i also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone <UNK> and a <UNK> scene that was simply <UNK> as in other movies of this kind it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female <UNK> as it is pure exploitation these women are tough they take no garbage from anybody and they're more than capable of handling themselves br br our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles <UNK> brown as the aggressive maggie <UNK> collins as the sassy belle <UNK> smith as the cute and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the wide eyed newcomer and <UNK> gold a k a <UNK> <UNK> in a bright appearance as an <UNK> on the outside br br as our climax plays out <UNK> comes up with a tense beat the clock finish as our <UNK> race to save belle from being <UNK> by <UNK> dr randolph warren miller the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women br br <UNK> along to john <UNK> <UNK> score <UNK> heat is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time br br 8 10
<START> our <UNK> of the perverse did good his first time out thats for sure the music is the best you may ever hear by any human but you already know that unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story but at least it has its moments the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it he deserved an oscar for this s t even though he was at times an ego driven <UNK> with his <UNK> bodyguard chick <UNK> always in front a movie that made non fans fans take it or leave it prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though he takes himself way to serious he is a genius musician but <UNK> just enjoy the ride my purple <UNK> peace
<START> the script is so so laughable this in turn makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed there's <UNK> of phrases my sweet little god daughter and minor variations of that line which comes to mind and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog br br worse yet the music is so wrong plus the main <UNK> theme is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this and it feels <UNK> mostly because the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of this theme never changes even when the <UNK> emotional context does br br subsequently whenever it appears it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another br br the <UNK> corny and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom a low budget 80's canadian sitcom at that and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial br br this is so miscast there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are <UNK> only one type of ny accent a thick <UNK> accent i don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing one ny accent or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring <UNK> br br in the end it's the amateur script with it's <UNK> lines which makes this entire movie blow when any foundation is shaky and unstable it's impossible to build upon it without it's flaws revealing themselves in <UNK> more <UNK> and <UNK> ways
<START> wow i'm shocked to learn that it's a small world and that we are all <UNK> what a waste of <UNK> minutes john dunne put it much better in one sentence no man is an island the acting wasn't bad the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i couldn't follow it and the only real hero in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a <UNK> maid i don't know i just don't get it oh well
<START> watch on the <UNK> started as a broadway play by <UNK> <UNK> who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non <UNK> <UNK> signed in august of 1939 so much for the fact that <UNK> was merely <UNK> the communist party line the line didn't change until a couple of months later <UNK> was actually months ahead of her time with this work br br the play watch on the <UNK> ran from april 1941 to <UNK> 1942 for <UNK> performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son <UNK> watson as the family <UNK> and most importantly villain george <UNK> and paul lukas br br lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against <UNK> bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell <UNK> mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> every one of his <UNK> was a bigger box office movie name than he was <UNK> nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field br br jack warner knew that which is why <UNK> christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of <UNK> wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially <UNK> role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it it's the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this one br br davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the <UNK> days after many years of being <UNK> on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war they're made welcome by <UNK> watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her <UNK> br br the fly in this <UNK> are some other house guests a friend of <UNK> from <UNK> days <UNK> fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a <UNK> <UNK> and aristocrat george <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> and a <UNK> and he <UNK> an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects <UNK> anti fascist background br br his <UNK> are quite correct it's the reason that the family has been the <UNK> they've become lukas fought in spain on the <UNK> side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family <UNK> supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the cast br br adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was <UNK> <UNK> who was <UNK> <UNK> significant other <UNK> playing cards at the german <UNK> was a <UNK> creation with such <UNK> types as henry <UNK> kurt <UNK> clyde <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account <UNK> count he was a metaphor for his own country who <UNK> the nazis with gusto and then equally <UNK> them without losing a step after <UNK> br br <UNK> watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943 but lost to <UNK> <UNK> in for whom the bell <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic casablanca br br though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the <UNK> still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely
<START> slaughter high is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty who gets pick on all the time by some <UNK> the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting <UNK> burned five years later his <UNK> all attend a reunion just the ten of them of course and low and behold marty murders them one after another british actress caroline <UNK> maniac leads the cast as the heroine who dies anyway the acting is completely awful there's also no suspense at all plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks a guy's stomach explodes another female victim literally gets an acid bath a couple having sex in bed get <UNK> a guy is crushed by a <UNK> one girl is drowned and a doctor gets a <UNK> <UNK> in the eye the killer wears a decent and rather creepy <UNK> mask and the setting a beautiful old english castle is really nice however the dream finale is utterly pathetic all in all it's true that slaughter high is a piece of garbage but i enjoyed it only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks
<START> nobody said movies had to be realistic did they i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high for all the kids who remember the <UNK> and albums before there were warning <UNK> it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's <UNK> crowd
<START> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to <UNK> br br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna <UNK> as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets <UNK> is nothing like the house described in the book although <UNK> the house they use for the <UNK> house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the <UNK> house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have <UNK> <UNK> br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an <UNK> bad adaptation is hard to find words to <UNK> it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives <UNK> he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why <UNK> has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible <UNK> wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man <UNK> and <UNK> in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter <UNK> in the book turns from a shallow <UNK> husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak aunt <UNK> still has a drink problem but now without any justification the <UNK> house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss <UNK> breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named <UNK> becomes the mundane <UNK> the word limit <UNK> me from continuing the list br br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that <UNK> <UNK> would have <UNK> this grotesque <UNK> of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
<START> this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space as a history of space flight it is still used today in <UNK> that can get one of the rare <UNK> of it disney has shown it on vault disney and i wish they would do so again
<START> first of all i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven't seen taking this into account i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me <UNK> for <UNK> my <UNK> daughter and any other piece of junk you've ever seen <UNK> must be out of his mind i've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about if you are able to <UNK> this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune <UNK> because there's any other way a person could figure this crap out br br for the love of g d stay away
<START> boring and <UNK> acted summer <UNK> she sounded more asian than jewish some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century what on earth fine actors like ian <UNK> anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me
<START> many things become clear when watching this film 1 the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy <UNK> are so so but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish the other two boys an overly <UNK> child <UNK> and your stereotypical i'm a babe but i'm really sensitive inside blonde <UNK> 2 the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing 3 <UNK> dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom hanks 4 the inclusion of the beginning love <UNK> is an odd choice we are all special friends 5 the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and 5 this is a really bad movie expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed
<START> one richard <UNK> and jackie <UNK> two great comics turned into <UNK> for a <UNK> kid they've both sold themselves out in this one worse than <UNK> character two horrible overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched three choice of a black actor as the toy the racial subtext of this is unbearable as its never addressed there's no message here <UNK> part could have been played by any comedic actor four that kid i wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting that would mean movies like this one and kid co might not have been made and my childhood would have been free of their mind <UNK> power so if you want to watch a couple of great comics <UNK> themselves in a <UNK> sweet kiddie flick go ahead if you want to see them in something good see <UNK> old <UNK> act and <UNK> in something better like the <UNK>
<START> there aren't enough gay themed movies and there aren't enough coming <UNK> movies every one is a welcome addition to the genre although the production values are high the movie <UNK> good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> looks real good in a pair of <UNK> this is a bad one it is a period piece gay life under an oppressive regime east berlin 1989 a life that seems 40 years behind the west in a way we're seeing our own history what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here it often reminded me of last exit to brooklyn the book not the film but it is <UNK> depressing and slow in a contrived way that <UNK> an old <UNK> send up of <UNK> bergman it is so <UNK> edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random yes it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes life behind the <UNK> was hard for gay people a good director could have shown all that without <UNK> the audience a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming out movies and not one of the misses
<START> let's see i'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can i say about the <UNK> br br i know the performances were no that won't work as they succeeded in <UNK> all personality from gwyneth paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara <UNK> br br oh how <UNK> the story nope that isn't gonna fly either as it was <UNK> inducing what was the genre anyway it wasn't funny that rules out comedy it wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic was that a romance between <UNK> and paltrow i have to ask as i can't be sure let's just call it losers in like i'm sure those behind this film started with a vision i mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but i need help finding it br br even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story i couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a <UNK> and messy <UNK> stupid hair speaking of hair are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and <UNK> locks worn by <UNK> br br what am i doing i already lost <UNK> <UNK> minutes in the actual watching of the movie i cannot <UNK> any more time to this loser
<START> people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i laughed br br only once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14 br br and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be br br taken seriously there were quite a few scenes that were meant br br to be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at br br them br br i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love br br and try to take it seriously i think you'll find that despite a few silly br br flaws it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen
<START> i loved this show from it's first airing and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week the plot characters writing special affects were outstanding then the sci fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining well written show i say bring it back i know all of the actors would come back i would suggest buying the dvd's i am i hope the sci fi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers i only watch one show on that channel now ghost hunters but i am fairly sure that shortly they will <UNK> that too
<START> i've been reading <UNK> here concerning wonder woman's costume for this tv movie it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit the producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer's conception of <UNK> for the early seventies br br as for the movie itself i have to agree with many of the other posters here <UNK> i was a kid when it appeared on abc in 1974 so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero yet i was so <UNK> with the plot i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie br br of course i wasn't at the right age to appreciate cathy lee
<START> quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time the plot was full of <UNK> and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time br br to make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue maybe not a bad thing then and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist <UNK> <UNK> video br br oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done better lighting next time please
<START> the true story of a bunch of <UNK> robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs jewelry guns and money some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids honestly this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man what is the second part of their master plan once they have his stuff they'll sit around and get high again great plan even if you don't know the story there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters with party scenes and a montage of their <UNK> is weak and insulting the story was better off with a more straight forward approach as it is this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers the bigger story in more ways than one is john holmes he is the center of this story anyway this movie should have been all about him his life he was the one in wonderland with the wonders about to fade away br br p s although it isn't official boogie nights is a better version of holmes life it isn't entirely factual but it's far more enjoyable
<START> this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it <UNK> made me <UNK> and laugh at my <UNK> youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters it's a biker flick but would be a shame to <UNK> hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the u k if you've never seen <UNK> make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done there's a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes
<START> while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too <UNK> ' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a <UNK> network of pans and <UNK> the musical score was once again solid proving hans <UNK> is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian <UNK> music
<START> one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers an observation which <UNK> me not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee it had many young actors who were to become major stars e g <UNK> maguire before <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before <UNK> jonathan rhys meyers before <UNK> james <UNK> simon baker mark <UNK> jeffrey wright tom <UNK> and jewel all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing br br when the <UNK> and <UNK> of the director even when he won an academy award and the actors are listed this film is usually <UNK> from their past performances i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films however it is seldom every seen on cable i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known
<START> this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the premise was o k but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean <UNK> of this tacky college film jason <UNK> was once again immensely irritating even more so than in <UNK> the rest of the cast were quite non <UNK> scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off putting incredibly juvenile tries to be a road trip american pie but fails <UNK> on all levels a total waste of everyone's time
<START> possible spoilers br br someone once asked dr seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas he turned them down <UNK> that no one could do better than the marvelous chuck jones tv special from 1966 also in mind perhaps was his bitter experience writing the script to <UNK> the 5 000 fingers of dr t when the good dr died in 1991 his widow audrey <UNK> still <UNK> refused to sell the movie rights but with the <UNK> use of cgi effects becoming a reality mrs <UNK> had a change of heart universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of jim carrey as the title character supposedly she was satisfied with the final result well mrs <UNK> that makes one of us br br the film was given a <UNK> 000 000 budget which is more than even <UNK> gate cost including the <UNK> for <UNK> which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup set design and special effects which are <UNK> br br somewhat by the rather <UNK> cinematography unfortunately it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what jeffrey price and peter s <UNK> <UNK> of who framed roger rabbit which made much better br br use of a high budget turned in whereas the tv special was a <UNK> 26 minutes without commercials this film tries to fill a running time of <UNK> minutes with more background information about the grinch it turns out that as a child he was the subject of <UNK> including an especially <UNK> experience one christmas at the age of eight so it turns out that everything that <UNK> our poor mr grinch is directly because of the <UNK> trouble is it seems like a rather long <UNK> minutes with too much dead wood <UNK> up the story that might not seem so bad if only the grinch were a little more well <UNK> the character that dr seuss wrote and chuck jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to <UNK> the holiday season were <UNK> by his sudden change and <UNK> growth of heart <UNK> grinch is a loud <UNK> <UNK> and at times a thug who when made the holiday <UNK> ' <UNK> the <UNK> town square in anger br br hopefully the scenery <UNK> as good as it looked this <UNK> the <UNK> attempt to make the grinch more sympathetic with all the <UNK> down in <UNK> so unsympathetic at least in this interpretation br br the <UNK> of dr <UNK> vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of christmas the <UNK> of the movie is a rather <UNK> and crowded place populated by spoiled selfish <UNK> <UNK> an obvious attempt to comment on american <UNK> this is <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> as the film industry has <UNK> greatly from american <UNK> and as this film contributed to it with a huge <UNK> br br campaign br br the film also <UNK> and <UNK> the character of cindy lou who a small but crucial character in the original the innocent two year old <UNK> who walked in on this <UNK> santa is now older and <UNK> constantly questioning the false values of the <UNK> and trying to understand the <UNK> point of view her one major scene from the original is re <UNK> making it seem out of character she br br seems to be the only one who would ever know that christmas is more than just gifts and <UNK> thus making her a completely different and more annoying character br br those who celebrate christmas should sooner accept a <UNK> of coal in their br br <UNK> on the morning of december 25 than a copy of this overlong <UNK> excruciatingly tedious ham handed crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film it proves once and for all that darkness <UNK> br br manipulation and heavy <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> for charm wit sincerity and heart the folks at universal should get down on their collective knees and thank god that this truly <UNK> <UNK> million stink bomb <UNK> <UNK> million <UNK> or they'd not be here today furthermore it made mike <UNK> the cat in the hat possible
<START> if you rent a movie titled <UNK> of the year 3000 the odds are good you know what you're getting yourself into i myself was sold by the promising <UNK> of <UNK> mutants <UNK> <UNK> and of course the <UNK> themselves which according to the back of the movie store case are all <UNK> around a post apocalyptic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all sorts of mayhem let the wacky <UNK> and low budget <UNK> ensue at least such were my hopes for this film br br now i like the occasional terrible movie and if you're reading the comments on <UNK> of the year 3000 you probably do too that being said i rated this film a solid 1 awful not because i completely hated the film but because it is one of the most <UNK> dreadful efforts at movie making i have ever seen the dialogue the acting the cinematography the sound editing the editing in general the plot etc etc etc all are worthy of what must surely be low <UNK> expectations given that marvelous title br br so what is really good about this bad movie it does have several of what my circle <UNK> terms quality kills a quality kill for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase isn't a hard and fast term but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome creative or ridiculous fashion br br <UNK> of the year 3000 also has a fair supply of dialogue so bad it becomes funny provided in great part by crazy bull the <UNK> titled leader of the hapless <UNK> psycho gang who incidentally also provide most of the quality kills if you're hoping for big things from the <UNK> mutants think again they play essentially zero part in the movie <UNK> crazy bull however is all you could ask for in a b movie <UNK> psycho shakespearean <UNK> and oddly pg style insults are all he knows how to say and that's terrific br br despite its quality kills and bad dialogue however if you're looking for a truly entertaining bad movie <UNK> of the year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects quality killing and bad dialogue there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length <UNK> <UNK> to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in <UNK> and boring car chases and long desert <UNK> sequences all in all a pretty good awful movie but hey it's no death race 2000
<START> though not a horror film in the traditional sense this creepy little film delivers the goods it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town <UNK> its victims of their blood police inspector karl <UNK> melvyn douglas in one of his early roles is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok the only one who believes him is ruth <UNK> faye <UNK> the <UNK> girlfriend and lab assistant to dr otto von <UNK> lionel <UNK> who though apparently an <UNK> scientist goes along with the vampire theory the <UNK> suspect the weirdo herman <UNK> played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role the film contains quite a bit of humor which helps <UNK> some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed one funny part has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ruth <UNK> aunt thinking weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog <UNK> <UNK> and dwight frye make a good comedy team br br this budget movie brings in elements from the <UNK> of dr <UNK> with dr <UNK> using the power of suggestion to make a <UNK> carry out his orders from frankenstein by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory and dracula since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a <UNK> <UNK> elements are mixed well by director frank r <UNK> with a little comedy thrown in for good measure the <UNK> works the restored version i viewed used <UNK> to increase the spooky atmosphere so try to see the this version if possible
<START> i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless <UNK> for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting i watched it despite the fact that i don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan <UNK> writes sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the <UNK> new clothes with this author's work i admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it however i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very <UNK> with this rather empty production the <UNK> gay sex that the media <UNK> on about has all been done before on tv several times so it was nothing very shocking i'm afraid full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content i'm afraid
<START> john carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication his excuse is that he only produced it jon bon <UNK> looks like a girl in fact bon <UNK> and the two vampire girls natasha wagner and <UNK> <UNK> probably all fit in the same clothes in short it was hard to tell which one was <UNK> in an <UNK> <UNK> model sort of way bon <UNK> has the most charisma at least he looks happy when he is smiling the two vampire girls on the other hand are all <UNK> and complaints at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss but stop amazing how each vampire movie has some set of <UNK> for the respective vampires at one point <UNK> <UNK> is providing <UNK> to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched <UNK> <UNK> move her head to <UNK> something that was very obviously not happening as far as gore is concerned a few heads are ripped off and the blood <UNK> <UNK> these scenes have so little suspense or build up that when they happen it is almost funny and there is no horror pay off from the scene all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of wow that sure was a lot of red paint <UNK> on the walls i wonder who has to clean it up throughout the movie these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill <UNK> <UNK> the top vampire in the world keep reaching out to her at one point bon <UNK> goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow and has done so on other occasions he says i am not trying to hurt you i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you huh of course the dumb vampire <UNK> jumps out to say hello and bon <UNK> sticks her again with another <UNK> device why can't we be friends the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie aside from all of the other silly moments there is a <UNK> sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed and the town people all line up to <UNK> blood for her <UNK> i guess blood type is not important anyhow all her vampire blood is removed bon <UNK> then decides that if that blood is <UNK> into him he can beat <UNK> by becoming a vampire also of course as the vampire blood is <UNK> into him none of his healthy blood is removed so apparently bon <UNK> is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body and just like the first vampires this one also has the vampires <UNK> into flames special effect
