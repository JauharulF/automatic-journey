<START> nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i'm not
<START> this is a sad film made for sad people i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another and there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t br br nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters the screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film there is no strong hold on any of these stories nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it i mean seriously is this story really required its not funny not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy another of the stories which was probably the only story i was interested in is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap i have no idea what the salmaan priyanka plot was all about there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot she can't take karan johar's film because she has to marry salmaan why can't she marry him and still take the film or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are with fans like these movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
<START> another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft br br so many clichÃ©s came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
<START> zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making firstly it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time br br zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet br br overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on board br br besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistake br br the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner how is it cool let me count the waysÂ1 zombie birth 2 flying zombie head 3 zombie birds 4 zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the machete wielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl br br favorite quote Â when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks don't you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything to which the sargeant boldly replies now you're talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies br br extras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details br br bottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fans br br rating 7 10 br br molly celaschi www horroryearbook com myspace com horroryearbook
<START> as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men Â whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide br br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the half way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary br br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies Â so those who aren't familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out br br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten maybe i'm the only one but it strained my eyes br br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you Â an interesting build up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country music montage about peace and serenity br br throw in some grisly from behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland asian thriller br br i just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions Âi thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us Â tetanus br br 4 10
<START> when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb's views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 7 0 or above on the site i did not enjoy br br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever br br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch black characters br br ethan hawke's hank is a 30 something whining immature irresponsible man child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser which he very much is his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film it's more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there br br speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non existent self esteem with insults seriously that's just about all the character does her harpy like behavior borders on malevolent br br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open half grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation for someone who's been an actor as long as mr finney you think he'd be more apt at emoting even though he doesn't show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger filled and when he smothers andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery br br marisa tomei isn't given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason when andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self serving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at least br br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 his performance of the heroin addicted embezzling financial executive who's perfect crime of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his mother br br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh's great performance and it's family train wreck nature just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really aren't
<START> hollywood's attempt to turn jack london's life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael o'shea as london has some londonesque speeches and it's nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between london's life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br jack london 11 24 43 alfred santell michael o'shea susan hayward virginia mayo
<START> i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you won't be disappointed just awed

<START> there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performances br br the story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars' table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br show people 11 11 28 king vidor marion davies william haines dell henderson
<START> somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and i'll start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wow br br spoilers for ang lee's hulk and the incredible hulk br br was it boring i almost didn't make it through ang lee's hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and that's no fun he's usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie ever br br but then something happened about 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare i say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good that's not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies and that's quite a feat br br of course the ending got really stupid with bruce banner's father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man's brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expected br br ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what it's boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here's the thing the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than ang lee's they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could br br worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee's failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesn't do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lee's version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk he's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br this is how i can definitively say ang lee's version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lee's version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely i'd just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience at least in ang lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of course br br it is absolutely mind boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lee's hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br it is to edward norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england
