<START> a battleship is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby liferaft sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks br br even though noel coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything that's cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the get go there are many moments where coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean's visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene the tracking shot towards the hymn singing the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed br br noel coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he's totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line br br 7 10 br br its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks overwhelm the story there's no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or penetrating film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for lean's editing skills its all about how the pieces are put together
<START> you must be seeing my comments over many films under evren buyruk i am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though this film is basically two hours of dafoe's character drinking himself nearly literally to death the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of time br br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter stormare is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one it's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result
<START> bingo is the game bullshit is the name rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown up hodgepodge of half baked conspiracy theories puritan prudery and new age gibberish the bulk of the story is set at viciente a cristian resort in the peruvian jungle think tolkien's rivendell meets star trek's planet baku inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow minded cult of love and peace thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design the rainbow colored visualization of the mysterious all healing energy is particularly hideous the celestine prophecies looks and feels like a discarded 1980s twilight zone episode factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound i can't believe hector elizondo agreed to be a part of this maybe it was made without his consent bowfinger style may the lord have mercy on the director the screenwriter the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book
<START> well basically the movie blows it's blair witch meets sean penn's ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader no offense to 8th graders the two main actors over act the entire film they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film not that i know anything about those things but it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd i'd rather watch the blair witch viii than sit through that again
<START> the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist the lady barbara skelton gets raped and gunned down in the end and not a moment too soon i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason br br the original 1943 novel called the life and death of the wicked lady skelton i guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then was written by a woman an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both her heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty nothing else matters but other things do matter such as the fact that lady barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide she murders three men in five attempts a serial femme fatale she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate br br lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration era joan rivers or a restoration era joan rivers ha yet lady b is irresistible to all three principal male characters michael rennie james mason and griffith jones all of whom do good work as does patricia roc of course all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down accidentally in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death but hers is the first corpse we don't care about
<START> this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies and the '80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can't be all bad also fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack br br the original vhs this was pre dvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the 'ozzy gene' cover was only created for the 5 re release the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put 'em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star br br i have a trick or treat web site and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr' br br all in all it was just a good time rock n roll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed
<START> the head of a common new york family jane gail as mary barton works with her younger sister ethel grandin as loma barton at smyrner's candy store after ms grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves ms gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore as larry burke must rescue the virtue threatened young woman br br traffic in souls has a reputation that is difficult to support it isn't remarkably well done and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's virtue threatened by sex traders perhaps it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length claimed to have been ten reels originally the new york city location scenes are the main attraction after all these years the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move br br traffic in souls 11 24 13 george loane tucker jane gail matt moore ethel grandin
<START> moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life not surprisingly they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire the guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story the group calls the cops the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it's a mountain lion and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost br br moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention one guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn't bother to load it then after he finally loads it he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn't bother to because that would end the movie too early then he throws the gun away also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don't look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn't help and in the end it tries to get away with it's incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie br br then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces again br br mediocre of it's kind good only for some unintended laughs br br 1 2 out of
<START> you are warned this is a spoiler this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it they must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle
<START> the notorious bettie page 2005 br br directed by mary harron br br starring gretchen mol chris bauer lili taylor sarah paulson david strathairn br br mpaa rating r for nudity sexual content and some language br br it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life from ray charles to johnny cash biopics are very posh right now the notorious bettie page is the latest of these to be released on dvd it features gretchen mol as the world's most famous pin up model bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color unlike ray walk the line and finding neverland however this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie page's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested this does not mean however that it is a bad movie in fact the notorious bettie page is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie a solid work of cinema this film focuses more on page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about br br everyone knows bettie page played by mol whether you know her as an iconÂor a simple porn starÂyou know her she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time now most people know her as one of america's first sex symbols a legend to many models especially those of playboy and other adult oriented magazines she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and page's bondage style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar in fact the photos launched a full fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn br br the performances in the notorious bettie page are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant i understand that when she was announced for the role many people were skeptical her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances now it will she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance david strathairn is fresh off of last year's good night and good luck in which he gave one of 2005's best performances here he gives yet another fine performanceÂeven though he is slightly underused i was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasÂbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in the haunting 1999 while most people ignored the movie i found it to be an enjoyable if not completely shallow horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally distraught nell here taylor gives yet another credible performance she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol br br after everything was said and done i realized that the notorious bettie page cannot be compared to other biopics such as finding neverland and walk the line it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end her personal life is briefly implied but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will haveÂbut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself after all she was an adult model turned christian missionary this movie does not over dramatize anything it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of her pastÂand yet it does not the notorious bettie page tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards fortunately it is quite refreshing br br final thought the notorious bettie page is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography br br overall rating 9 10 a
