<START> an unassuming subtle and lean film the man in the white suit is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course br br the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired kind hearts and coronets from 1949 this time he merely plays one character rather than eight but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton he always finds the correct tone and expression along with guinness' subtle expressive performance the rest of the cast are effective of the main players cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father father that is of joan greenwood the deftly delectable comic actress who is at her insurmountable peak in this film resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction she is quite sublime in this film a fine contrast with the similarly unusual but more maladroit guinness the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing br br the themes are handled very effectively with no easy morals drawn the complexities of the relationships between science business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick this film is technically adept in all areas evocative photography fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script all quietly impress a thoroughly satisfying film with guinness and greenwood magnificent br br rating 1 2

<START> nicely done and along with new voyages it's a great continuation fab to see james cawley in the latest episode vigil check it out br br i like the growing characterisation and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan produced piece this show manages to capture the feel quite well as they state on the ste it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience a strong script editor and a pick up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is br br good work to all concerned br br i have a huge soft spot for lefler mcfarland great acting although i'm a bit tired of lefler's laws enough already shelby's great if a little uptight and it's cool she got the ship commodore ian's nice like fred flintstone but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself the doc counselor and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes as is the wonderful nechayev what a beautiful accent a real russian well i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep br br it gets my vote and the cgi is kewl some of the greenscreen's obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo br br really glad i found it br br ok some of the acting isn't great but it's fan made and is therefore allowed to be variable sorry cmm cole br br the gay material is layed on too thick graham norton'd be embarrassed trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent i hope they tone it down let aster zen be people not tokens i don't treat my gay friends any differently they're just regular guys br br musically it's a mixed bag i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time but timing can fall flat now then the end of worst fears part 2 misses the crunch and the edit love the fact they use the galaxy quest music br br i certainly can't wait for more dazza br br never give up never surender br br viva les frontieres
<START> i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly made for tv movie also women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era Â would it make for good viewing honestly i don't know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest i have ever seen from several hodgepodge styles of acting to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in wyoming especially during the early 1900s so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattle branding scene the pig slaughtering scene and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell's elinore randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i don't know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore's daughter i just didn't believe it the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger film br br overall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation these panoramic scenes which in the span of 100 years have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world but instead left open loopholes and clichÃ©d western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by me br br grade out of
<START> this show is possibly the biggest ugliest most generic steam pile i've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful the lead character johnny while i understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid isn't likable or even tolerable the jokes are lame overdone i e the whoa didn't see that coming gag come on that wasn't even funny the first time it's not even cute and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration and lastly it's just plain ugly to look at while kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent they still prefer eye candy i can't stand watching the show because in a way the art style is just gross hideous in fact just plain crummy br br i just can't stand that this is getting so much airtime while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back i really miss the old cartoons bring back dexter's laboratory the powerpuff girls anything but this crap i guess it's just wishful thinking though br br simply put i advise you don't waste your time on this show i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids too and this doesn't cut it
<START> obviously i didn't care for things to come aka the shape of things to come as much as most viewers that means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than i did at any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view br br directed by william cameron menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by h g wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter br br the film opens in 1940 in a london like everytown war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decades long affair that basically destroys civilization wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a post apocalyptic community ruled over by a would be warlord we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon br br that might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments there's a constant parade of new faces we don't get to learn anything about any of them br br it doesn't help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulative it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally br br in fact one overlong section is more like a music video industrial promotional video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score i can't say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama br br but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesn't make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented here br br the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations that's a fine thing to make a film about it's also remarkably prescient of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesn't preclude progress in fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectly br br that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field they can't both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two functioning gas masks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says he's dying anyway what to do it's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideas the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war are enough to build a film on br br another example during the scenes featuring the would be warlord in the post apocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought it's a great idea and deserved its own film br br similarly wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas that was enough for its own film too it's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction br br still there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if you're at all a sci fi buff this is a historically important film given menzies' background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated it's also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george mÃ©liÃ¨s' 1902 a trip to the moon aka le voyage dans la lune just don't expect too much from things to come
<START> this film is terrible you don't really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say don't unless you are studying how not to make a good movie br br the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for him br br the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible movie br br don't watch it go for a jog instead at least you won't feel like killing yourself

<START> perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933's popeye the sailor fleischer studios paramount although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series br br as is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this day br br returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series the reasoning then surely seemed sound henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' line up appearing as both a daily and on sunday's color comics supplement puck the comics weekly you know what fools these mortals be remember that one schultz in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime' br br in the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american fleischer studios paramount pictures corporation 1935 we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer's rapid fire machine gun like gags in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop's pet shop it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket he is in formed by miss boop that it would be 2 00 in depression era money to make the purchase tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly br br but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return of course they have a deal and betty leaves br br getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed henry's bald pate and push brooms but not all at once of course schultz henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break br br betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry's temporary custodial care all bets were off no doggie for henry he begins to leave dejectedly but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up his head covered with bird seed he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures returning them to their pet store coop happily the little fella leaves but this time he has his own affectionate little face licking puppy br br undoubetly this was a winning combination we have the carefree energy filled free wheeling of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini masterpiece of a surreal comedy short br br we were quite surprised that no henry series followed judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been sustained for some time at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures although the first popeye the sailor fleischer paramount 1933 was the most successful and barely had any betty boop in it save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer the henry short was much better than the two following king features tryouts betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy both 1936 br br poodle schnitz
<START> de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques though unfortunately as with many of the films written by de palma himself the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale br br the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearÂ and the whole thing is revealed to be angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed she has a short scene with her son a dead ringer for harry potter which concludes with a joke that she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter she then goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist michael caine he refuses and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled br br then begins a bravura 22 minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling storiesÂ and in typical de palma fashion he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill the problem for me is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill br br the sequence begins with angie at an art museum she watches strangers all involved in sexual or family activities then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie's attraction embarrassment retreating and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio who also scored carrie br br in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy and gets up to return to her husband again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered as angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is that she has probably contracted a venereal disease and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle it's all very admirable but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor then up again almost in real time br br spoilers from here on out when angie reaches the seventh floor again she is killed by a big woman with blond hair the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there there is a wonderful slow motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator angie reaches up toward her and the killer's blade is held poised to slash nancy's hands then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror it's all good and by the time we have some dialogue again you think woah that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative or maybe you don't but i do br br a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him he interviews michael caine making the outrageous implication though it passes as commonplace that angie wanted to be killed angie's son is there as well and he hooks up with nancy and they set about to spy on caine's therapist and find out who the killer is br br once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film in this case psycho just as obsession is a re working of vertigo you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space in this case an elevator rather than a shower then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing br br it is very interesting but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around and that is my primary reservation about this film it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest setpieces but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole hearted affection br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de merde cinemademerde com
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill but the script is incredibly shallow and lame you actually hear serious dialogue that goes i love you more no i love you more i stopped watching the movie online after the first half hour i couldn't take it anymore her southern girl charm just doesn't work and is really quite annoying her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page br br poor luke wilson did he not read the script before agreeing to do this or did he fall for papa joe's jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie promise of big profits hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this luke wilson is actually a good actor i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue br br also i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging br br jessica has lots of money right maybe buy some acting lessons
<START> back in the days before the toxic avenger the low camp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhat less low road of producing straight slasher pics i'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self conscious parody br br splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let's see if i can summarize br br after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i don't recall the name but in honor of the title let's call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but don't hold your breath waiting for it there's a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it's back to the asylum and roll credits br br the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffee can sound quality and dialog that just doesn't make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killer's fixation on women the men in this movie are just so deserving i'd've paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriend's roommate or any of the creepy priests there ain't no justice
