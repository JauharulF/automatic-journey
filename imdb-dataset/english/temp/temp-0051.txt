<START> the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent the actors the voice overs the direction it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly i absolutely love this picture
<START> holes 2003 dir andrew davis br br when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing he is sent to 'camp green lake' at this camp the warden and her two henchman mr sir and dr pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole but for what reason stanley plans to find out br br i never really had any intention in watching 'holes' and i must admit i only really watched the film because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf but even if you are not a fan of him then it doesn't matter 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past these are not distracting and really gives a great back story all the cast are great the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy shia labeouf shows that even at 17 he can act without any flaws this is one disney film you definitely would enjoy as a family br br i learn from failure stanley yelnats iii henry winkler
<START> ok but does that make this a good movie well not really in my opinion there isn't a whole lot to recommend it i found it very slow tediously in fact it's also predictable pretty much through and through number one and two were somewhat predictable but not as much i also felt this movie was quite campy at times which i didn't really think fits this series and the character jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment he's a decent enough actor but i felt he played his character too over the top i guess that fit with the tone of the movie which would have been great if i had liked the movie plus there were some pretty bad one liners arnold vosloo returns in the title role but is given little to work with in this movie the character has not really evolved as i had hoped oh well this is just my opinion anyway for me while this movie is not abysmal it is pretty bad my vote for darkman iii 3 5 5
<START> anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors joe brady gene kelly and clarence doolittle brooklyn frank sinatra get a special four day shore leave eager to get to the girls particularly joe's lola neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navy mad donald dean stockwell and his aunt susie kathryn grayson unexperienced in the ways of females and courting brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over along the way however joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal and does joe end up with susie who loves him too br br the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town the kelly sinatra collaboration from 1949 both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them yet both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall having now seen both films a third time i still stand by that judgement somehow on the town as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh i'm not quite sure why this is the typical argument is that the latter film is over long at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it however it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making and yet something just doesn't hang together quite right it feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted and that's exactly what happened no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up and that's probably the film's biggest weakness it has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while contrast this for example with the ten numbers in on the town you might well feel that each song each dance can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and that's true but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place br br all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie' the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all 'i fall in love too easily' and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of kelly it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even clarence's own brooklyn pamela britton is cute and charming as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town his singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing his solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when you've got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film br br gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively anchors aweigh really is kelly's film his joe brady is a believable real character he's tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands and the dancing again the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome as it does with sinatra's singing but once again if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief might as well err on the side of overdoing it all of kelly's dances are breathtaking be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl or his lavish spanish influenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom jerry' fame a well deserved golden film memory to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market but gene and jerry still look great with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation br br it's doubtless that this first daring inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs but it's also notable for being the first of three kelly sinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawn out still a great couple of hours of entertainment watch it first then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it 7 5 10
<START> the plot is plausible but banal i e beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private round the clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life threatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
<START> john water's pink flamingos pecker is the best movie i've seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore i live in nearby washington dc with a warhol like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved ones including a sexy ricci by his man loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear arms and everything else this country stands for juan pieczanski jpieczanski sidwell edu
<START> more than just a kids' movie holes looks at how past incidents still affect us today whether we know about them or not when teenager stanley yelnats iii shia leboeuf gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection to it through flashbacks we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize you'll understand this better when you see the movie leboeuf does a pretty good job as do the other cast members sigourney weaver jon voight tim blake nelson henry winkler patricia arquette and eartha kitt a very interesting movie
<START> although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show ever br br i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and i am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq br br the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics br br basic story that they covered in the episode frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ex girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son he gives money freely to lots of broke students all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him don't worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on i was almost sick at this point br br this 'drama' gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is your gonna laugh at this i sure did br br it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral br br the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br br why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line watching this show is like watching 'last action hero' with arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick except arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br in the words of the simpsons beloved character 'comic book guy' br br worst tv show ever
