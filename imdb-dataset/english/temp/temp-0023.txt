<START> i have never seen one of these scifi originals before this was the first i think it only fair to judge the acting direction production set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair i will say however that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of werner herzog's masterpiece aguirre wrath of god br br i will begin by noting that yes i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture clash than it does with dinosaurs despite this being a made for tv sci fi movie there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine the symbolic elements included are evident enough br br consequently as a student of history theology mythology and film i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting i am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers as i said before the movie is what it is but what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity br br the main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character ayacoatl not a commentary on dichen lachman's performance but simply how her character was written although i'll say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy nods it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified her function in the film as the love interest of rios affirms that the european way is the right way simply because they are european there is really no other reason given it's really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress language ideology etc is more familiar to them than the aztec so therefore the aztec are portrayed as adversarial and 'backwards ' and it's not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan if not a better one to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks br br in fairness there is a subgroup of the spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native mesoamericans there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec they have agriculture medicine calendar etc but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie even over the 'thunder lizards' more on that later he his portrayed as treacherous duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic european spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native meso north americans again more on this later so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the spaniard br br now in analyzing the true nature of the story leaving the obvious christian vs pagan themes off of the table from a symbolic standpoint a viewer can easily take these so called thunder lizards to be representatives of the mesoamerican ideology theology which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on bloodthirstiness mercilessness cruelness wicked maybe even evil in opposition we have this group of christian wanderers led by a young hernando cortes who are portrayed as naive yet overall noble lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the aztec also the name of the film is aztec rex leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people however what aztec rex translates to is aztec king a the head of the aztec state or in this instance 'state of being ' hence why the title of the film was changed and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end it's the remaining spaniard rios aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which overcame through disease bloodshed war famine native americans rios symbolizes the ideal european as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered in opposition to cortes who represents the 'practical yet still noble european' but when you examine the holocausts of the americas let us be honest don't the symbolic components of this film's story have it backwards br br i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist or to be kind about it ignorant at best br br and yes i know it's just a movie all meant to be in fun i understand but so at the end we're left with the idea that rios was the father of the last remaining aztec lines i wonder what native mesoamericans would have to think about this ending as for myself i thought it was a little too self indulgent br br best supporting performance of the movie goes to ian ziering's wig although conspicuous it did at least alter ziering's appearance enough so that i didn't think i was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness ziering actually proves himself to be a more than capable actor in this movie i actually bought his performance or at least i forgot it was ian ziering anyway i don't know whom his agent is but he should get more work br br in closing it was also a pleasure to see jim mcgee again i've been a fan ever since his all too brief scene stealing performance in 1988's scrooged br br alexander quaresma deusexmachina529 aol com
<START> h g wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural biology on one side and marxism market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race first of all the non caucasian with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages then within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy the alcoholics the mentally disabled all those who were genetically disabled etc that was not hitler that was h g wells and that was not after the first world war that was more than ten years before and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth would see the differentiation of the human race into two species the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election no parliament no really democratic institution only peace imposed by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors and in that future world all absolutely all human beings are caucasians wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036 amazing wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets frightening and that was produced in 1936 all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism fascism japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h g wells we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute democratic social selection or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days it would be unfair to go beyond this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

<START> tell the truth iâm a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it i was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie br br iâm surprise at this movie all completely â it is like a kidâs movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing iâm not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account br br synopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak br br just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and havenât we already seen the same characters play by mc lovinâ in so many other movies like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep br br well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is so so as expected when youâre watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie br br anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie canât really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone br br pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes br br cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix together br br rating 3 5 10 grade f
<START> i still can't believe this movie they got so much unbelievable things in it that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it br br the story is a joke but in the sense of being funny but more like no story at all how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery a prison movie town conspiracies sex jokes and a fbi agent you can't br br beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors i watched this film and thought 'is this really marlon brando no it can't be 5 minutes later is this charlie sheen wow maybe brando is true 5 minutes later this can't be donald sutherland 5 minutes later no not mira sorvino this movie is too bad for all of them at the end no no no this can't absolutely not be martin sheen not for 10 seconds of such a movie ' then it was over and i down with my nerves so many good oscar winning usually convincing actors in such a stupid dumb awful movie i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one they couldn't got so much money br br only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie br br 3 10 1 4 5 1 6

<START> 1927 and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade now that it had become the site of a multi million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established some of those in the calmer quarters of this film making factory were taking the time for a little self reflection the last command while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal it was written by lajos biro who had been on the scene long enough to know br br taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants Â emil jannings before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well timed performance often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has beens he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings's scenery chomping caricatures however as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range showing by turns delicate frailty serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance br br the director was another immigrant albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister the von was made up by the way and took a very distinctive approach to the craft of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes we open with a carefully constructed chaos with movement in converging directions which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen then when jannings arrives everything settles down jannings's performance is incredibly sedate and measured and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order br br sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic in fact he really seems to have an all round lack of interest in action in the scene of the prisoners' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance his camera eventually retreating to a fly on the wall position compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent which are a complex medley of point of view shots and intense close ups thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction br br as a personality on set it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell and in fact powell's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically it appears no one told his co stars they were not in a comedy evelyn brent is fairly good giving us some good emoting but overplaying it here and there the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself it's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless like a male ninotchka but he does a good job revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard hearted exterior br br the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film making process even a relatively tame example like this at the very least i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the behind the scenes view as it threatened the mystique of movie making which was still very much alive at this point as it turned out such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and according to some sources although the issue is a little vague a nomination for best picture this is significant since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self indulgent back slapping by the hollywood elite but elite or not they recognised good material when they saw it and were willing to reward it
<START> i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again br br i have seen action films i have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top br br not only does it have the worst male actor ever sly stallone playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it br br furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next it is a set of cliches of action genre with sly performing even worse than his other movies he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film now there is an actor who can't act a surprised b sad c anything else than his basic face br br i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it explosions are outstanding but then you can see better on the 4th of july landscapes are magnificient but then there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick br br go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies
<START> zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i don't typically go for military war movies but this was worth my time br br it was serious but it was also humorous beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that he's got your back br br zane's character developed throughout the film he wasn't just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun br br the ending through me a little though it didn't really go with the action throughout the film but i'm glad that i saw it nonetheless br br it's worth checking out
<START> to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else some expletives might describe it but still too positively normally one ignores this kind of rubbish but it was so stupid that one can but despair would have though that even americans and commercial tv stations would have given this piece of s t a miss but as the germans say gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens

<START> this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers br br a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it's good br br it's just bad
