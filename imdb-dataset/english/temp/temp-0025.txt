<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england

<START> the blob qualifies as a cult sci fi film not only because it launched 27 year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s interestingly nobody in the kay linaker theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous scarlet red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as the blob steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall the old west bounty hunter in wanted dead or alive after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures' release meanwhile mcqueen's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in the andy griffith show as sheriff taylor's school teacher girlfriend helen crump of course neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers director irvin s yeaworth jr made his directorial debut with the blob linaker simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres first the alien invasion second teenage delinquency third a murder mystery and fourth a horror chiller moreover while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes it remains largely anonymous in other words the eponymous jell o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy instead it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody the tone of the blob is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature br br as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of the blob the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing jane anita corsaut and steve steve mcqueen see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it meanwhile an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick when the old timer olin howland of the paleface gets a closer look at it the goop attaches itself to his hand the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr hallen in town br br hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation of course hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve's fast driving steve fools him into a reverse drive race but the local police chief dave earl rowe lets him off the hook steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor after they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr hallen's office during the interim the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer killed hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident dave is frankly incredulous while sergeant bert john benson believes that it is a prank bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car br br steve and jane take them to hallen's office but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody but dave admits that the office has been vandalized against sgt bert's advice dave turns the teens over to their respective parents no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again they drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket when they go to retrieve the mutt steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens they find nobody inside but they encounter the blob steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them later after they escape steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store about that time the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers suddenly a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off br br the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark producer james b harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo br br the blob proved to be a drive in hit and steve mcqueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum unless you are a juvenile this little horror movie isn't scary at all but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination so the blob isn't without a modicum of subtlety
<START> i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception it may have been a brilliant horror thriller movie br br beginning on halloween night 1968 6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again br br from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael the murderer is exactly the same throughout the movie thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow br br for the horror thriller enthusiast there is a severe lack of blood gore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age a happier medium could have been found br br from a half hour into the movie not one scene is unexpected the acting for a horror thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast br br a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere a second positive would be the character of michael's doctor who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead br br however it is clear that the star in jamie lee curtis is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim br br it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day but from other horror thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s it falls far short of a truly great horror thriller film br br i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s cheers
<START> the movie is great like every other international project that includes strong impressions three of them israel bosnia and egypt should've been cut out especially bosnian clip which is pathetic beyond all reason and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on it's own everything else is really great unrecognizable for most of americans known for the rest of the world unfortunately clips speak about misery of the people all over the world and as i see it there are so many of those who won't give a damn about it br br top 5 1 loach 2 penn 3 inarritu 4 lalouche 5 imamura
<START> those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow 1 priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed 2 akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by rabified dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a frown please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'
<START> fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression when people were having a tough time worldwide finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table in europe hitler was on the rise along with other nationalist socialist whackjobs in the united states seeds of the cartel sown with the federal reserve act and the income tax amendment 16 were beginning to bear fruit for connected finance capitalists and their dominating secret societies br br for the average guy and girl times were tough enter hollywood with at least some hopeful imagesÂi don't think we can properly call them propaganda at this point even though this particular movie revolves around war preparatory naval exercises the real issue for boys and girls then as now was how to hook up with the right one lead a decent life have wonderful children with a modicum of grace and elegance br br the odds were long br br br br for my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site thecoffeecoaster com br br brian wright copyright 2007

<START> don't bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilyn br br the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why nellie monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didn't need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films br br it's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne bancroft elisha cook jr jeanne cagney donna cocoran and others br br summary it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game
<START> in the winter of 1931 supposedly 12 year old tyler hoechlin as michael sullivan jr wonders what his mobster father tom hanks michael mike sullivan does for a living young hoechlin follows mr hanks to work one evening and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters this leads in a very roundabout way to godfather type paul newman as john rooney hiring independent hit man jude law as harlen maguire to track down hoechlin and hanks who are off to cool their heels in chicago hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work br br looking uncannily like paul peterson the donna reed show hoechlin does a terrific job for director sam mendes and getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002 but the most striking thing about road to perdition is the stunning cinematography of conrad l hall which deservedly won a career capping academy award for the late photographer mr hall's work is truly superlative this helps make up for the overall impression of a measured contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals the deviating end is abruptly uplifting the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess br br road to perdition 7 12 02 sam mendes tom hanks tyler hoechlin paul newman jude law
<START> i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don't think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he's in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an 8 5 10 bethany cox
<START> this film aka the four hundred blows is a mistranslation faire les 400 coups means to live a wild life as a french i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good but by no means outstanding film 1 it's not the first film of the nouvelle vague move check agnes varda's la pointe courte 1956 alain resnais's hiroshima mon amour 1958 claude chabrol's le beau serge 1958 are anterior historically les 400 coups comes after 2 the nouvelle vague was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors overnight julien duvivier henri george clouzot claude autant lara yves allÃ©gret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion this selfishness and this contempt is typically nouvelle vague you 've never heard or read the great generation of the thirties renoir carnÃ© grÃ©millon duvivier already feyder laugh at say maurice tourneur or max linder so thanks to truffaut and co some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties duvuvier's sous le ciel de paris autant lara's douce yves allÃ©gret's une si jolie petite plage and manÃ¨ges the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless 3 les 400 coups is technically rather disappointing it's very academic the story is as linear as it can be the teachers are caricatures and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is well your father 's got only his brevet junior school diploma and as for me i've got only my high school diploma you've got to know that circa 1960 hardly 10 of the pupils had the hsd in france antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all she wants him to have diplomas who can blame her 4 compared to the innovations of hiroshima mon amour which features a brand new form and a new fragmented content les 400 coups pales into significance truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior jules and jim helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau 5 the interpretation is rather stiff jean pierre lÃ©aud arguably listenable when dubbed in english is still decent but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation 6 the topic stolen childhood had better days before julien duvivier's poil de carotte luis bunuel's los olvidados and will have after maurice pialat's l'enfance nue kenneth loach's kes i do not want to demean truffaut his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer jules and jim l'enfant sauvage a film honest true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault l'argent de poche as academic as 400 coups but much more funny or his nice hitchcock pastiche vivement dimanche br br
