<START> the key to the 40 year old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40 year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40 year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiosity br br carell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character Â we get to understand why andy is the way he is it's the little things that make this film work when andy's co worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesn't just adorn his home with action figures Â he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things br br the plot is fairly simplistic Â andy's co worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman it's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility br br andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies' man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic br br finally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days Â trish being unaware that andy is still a virgin br br the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script Â co written by carell Â offers plenty br br however in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40 year old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film it's easy to understand why we like andy we care about him he's not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy clichÃ© Â he's a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audience br br although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen the best sex comedies work this way Â from risky business to american pie Â and that is the major difference between something like the 40 year old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights
<START> i liked this a lot in fact if i see it again and i plan to i just may love it i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it you just get into it br br i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take br br i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love br br one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those like me who love the south and movies that take place there this is a gem i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick
<START> watching cbs's surrender dorothy i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it not because it's a television movie with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isn't any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tv but because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine a single mother grieving the sudden death of her twenty something daughter imposes upon and gradually becomes friends with the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of self absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay hears diane keaton say surrender dorothy and actually asks that's from the wizard of oz right no genius it's from citizen kane keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way here she's a crazed harpy who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self discovery the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat it should help a lot of grieving mothers out there i can't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling it's deranged
<START> la coda dello scorpione a k a case of the scorpion's tail was director sergio martino's follow up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh this is the quintessential giallo featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love twisty plot beautiful girls black gloves sharp blades and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation br br a group of gialli favorites both in front of and behind the camera work to make this one of the best non argento gialli around there's the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer bruno nicolai creating the music and a host of giallo stars and starlets such as george hilton character actor luigi pistilli and the fetching anita strindberg br br with all this talent behind it does scorpione deliver you bet the film works on many different levels it's a thrilling murder mystery a tense and violent horror film and a suspenseful thriller all in all one of the best gialli around br br martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli at some points in the film he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach for example there is a direct rip off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door that actually outdoes argento's flick br br are there any problems with the flick hmmm only minor ones first any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore but just before you fall asleep the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things br br also towards the end the twists get a little too bizarre i mean what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve if you don't play close attention to the dialogue you could easily become lost with the twisting weaving storyline br br but these minor quibbles aside la coda dello scorpione is a tense suspenseful classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans seek it out
<START> i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter kolchak was hard bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big city reporting and his gritty determination and wise ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable my personal fave was the spanish moss murders due to it's totally original storyline a poor troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth much to the chagrin of police captain joe mad dog siska wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder severn darden to droll understated perfection the wickedly funny harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system and is a series highlight kolchak never got any better timeless
<START> when i go to see a movie about zombie's i'm not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor that wasn't very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes in fact i left after the hottest one got killed there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that

<START> paris je t'aime is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing ask a large group of people their impressions of life in paris and the result would be something akin to this film tied together by each of the sectors or arrondissement of the city the film examines love in all forms native folk in their parisian modes and tourists interacting with the great city approximately twenty writers and directors each with about five minutes of screen time include olivier assayas the coen brothers sylvain chomet isabel coixet wes craven alfonso cuarÃ³n gÃ©rard depardieu christopher doyle vincenzo natali alexander payne walter salles nobuhiro suwa and gus van sant among others less well known the stories vary from hilarious to humorous to touching to tragic to banal to tender br br in one story a young frenchman gaspard ulliel is attracted to a young lithographer elias mcconnell pouring out his heart in french to a lad who speaks only english in another a separated husband and wife gena rowlands and ben gazzara meet in the latin quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in pÃ¨re lachaise emily mortimer and rufus sewell approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed oscar wilde intervenes steve buscemi in tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections in bastille sergio castellitto in love with mistress leonor watling is ready to divorce his wife miranda richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia juliette binouche confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in place des victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy willem defoe sara martins and nick nolte and ludivine sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in parc monceau fanny ardant and bob hoskins 'play out' a strange relationship in pigalle melchior beslon plays a young blind man to actress natalie portman in learning how to see in faubourg saint denis vampire love between elijah wood and olga kurylenko in quartier de la madeleine maggie gyllenhaal is an ex patriot actress stung out on drugs in quartier des enfants rouges and margo martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the french she has studied for her life's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14Ã¨me arrondissement br br the final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible but this only works on superficial levels the film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action but it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re visit like a scrapbook of a time in paris it is a film worth seeing multiple times grady harp
<START> before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut confessions of a dangerous mind they starred together in this movie george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with steven soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie remakes such as ocean's eleven and the italian job but somehow this movie is only halve successful or at least it isn't as good as it could had been br br the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie the fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at all br br it's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential i can only assume that the original italian movie i soliti ignoti works out much better than this movie does the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling br br nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity it's an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story in that regard welcome to collinwood is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well br br it's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing br br 7 10
<START> i loved this movie i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan but i really enjoyed myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going this is a bit of a departure for disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development my husband pointed this out and there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney be they young or old
<START> i am wanting to make a holmes with doors pun but i can't quite string it all together suitably grubby and over edited wonderland gives kilmer a role that channels morrison at the same time but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead as someone famous said once about us cinema double standards kiss a breast and it's an x stab it and its an action pg 13 wonderland is 14 minutes too long too and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema how many films called wonderland are we going to get there must be six in the last decade the pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble cam gets tiresome as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time taking a few cues form the doors and taxi driver it all becomes forgettable the next day
