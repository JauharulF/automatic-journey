<START> the movie itself was ok for the kids but i gotta tell ya that scratch the little squirrel was the funniest character i've ever seen he makes the movie all by himself he's the reason i've just love this movie congradulations to the crew it made me laugh out loud and always will
<START> and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on i've seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d kman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen that's it that's the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch there's a bag lady beauty contest in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won't be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who's saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they're regarded as stuck up squares i just saw white chicks recently that's another low brow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it's not funny what the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from there's something about mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list the joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off ben's ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy thing's not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let's face it nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjective but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan's fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i don't think she's done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the film's biggest star keeping in mind duncan wasn't famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her for good reason usually i'm in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesn't become a cult classic shouldn't there be a law against distributing crap like this
<START> if you're going to look after a child make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her 'friends' but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on br br in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what they'd signed up for and gone awol yes i know it's hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you'd want if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress rosalie cole the next dakota fanning she ain't the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax br br this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown br br finally the film closes it doesn't end it just goes to a grinding halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films you're ever likely to see and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back just think years from now on your deathbed what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly it's already too late for me don't you make the same mistake 2 10
<START> just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the thing in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling br br for me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking something it never really is it doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an oh as on oh thats it maybe if i hadn't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn't have compared it to so much br br i'd take a pass
<START> this is high grade cheese fare of b movie kung fu flicks bruce wannabe lee is played by bruce li i think of course let's show quick clips of bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice it kind of looks like bruce you'll laugh in awe at how the film splicing isn't very good but some cool deleted scenes from enter the dragon are thrown in the mix according to the movie bruce lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter of course they think this can excuse bruce li for trying to be bruce even though his character is supposed to be bruce's brother who for some reason still mimes bruce's gestures and fighting style very poorly see bruce go one on one with the cowardly lion the props department stopped by kay bee you see bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man towards the end the director decided let's throw a flashback for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago they must've thought that only one celled organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film br br
<START> this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes again the previews say nothing about this not that you would expect that but it's just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i would've never have seen it or at least i would've been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again
<START> an uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they're off to discover america get the idea there's not an original moment in this whole movie
<START> on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it's not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic
<START> we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not therefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that br br this movie is very good not just good but very good the critics are a bunch of morons just because there is nudity and language they hated it it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for is that not right every movie cannot be an academy award nominee sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
<START> i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a cyber kung fu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering is this the film that's going to break the mold let's face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar after such great classics as monkey trouble and dunston checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i contemplated suicide br br now i've read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didn't let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z i t has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesn't seem cost effective well anyways z i t brings in a cia specialist matthew modine to train clemens the chimp clemens is everything z i t hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie as you may have guessed modine finds out that z i t 's intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break clemens out being a cia agent and all modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything br br z i t finds out where modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and hooch it doesn't matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win yay hooray for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game br br funky monkey never lets up it's edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkey filled features after finishing this epic i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe funky monkey is a metal rod among movies

<START> office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps ' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers' and office space ' and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it's predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc'l'isco ' it's an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn't all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp ' it's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm ' the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he's nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he's typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do' in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important' letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth's days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh ' but they didn't and the audience won't because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays' funny as in he knows' he's being funny he never is and that's exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny ' he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad' is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance if only momentarily but it's still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel ' however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it's destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as obscurity ' i rate this one 1 10 br br br br
