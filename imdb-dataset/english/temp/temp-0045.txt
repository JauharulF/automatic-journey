<START> 0 5 10 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldn't say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
<START> the female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre she was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter this should have made the police suspect her i would have been inconsolable in the identical situation she seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter it was as if she did not want to even be in the movie jennifer aniston would have played the part better and it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject everyone else was excellent i don't know where the lead actress is but i hope she got some acting lessons
<START> i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time an english major at that at the time i saw this film i was a high school student i want to say junior year but it may have been senior hard to remember my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like i'm not a phd by any means br br that said br br this movie is simply terrible it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science and they are numerous and she dismissed my claims because oh so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds in this case apparently so br br leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or in fact intelligent leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film leaving that behind the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when in fact he completely opposed them br br i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so br br http www intuitor com moviephysics bleep html
<START> this movie is a rather odd mix of musical romance drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it it's basically one messy heap of different genres of which none really works out like it was supposed to br br this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor he's a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie i mean mickey rooney as a tough player he's an extremely small boyish looking man he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right he simply isn't convincing in his role br br because the movie mixes so many different genres the story also really feels as a messy one somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch lÃ¡szlÃ³ kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957 he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality br br let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white generally speaking black white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception br br it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies often simply as himself i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song br br an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney br br 4 10
<START> this movie really is a mixed bag on the one hand the story and concept of the movie are really good tense and have some nice plot twists in it but than again on the other hand it all is told very slow without style and uninvolved still i regard just cause as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast br br maybe sean connery was miscast in his role i mean he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way and husband of kate capshaw i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne blair underwood ned beatty hope lange lynne thigpen and ed harris all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer he's truly chilling and acting superbly normally he doesn't play this ruthless chilling sort of roles in movies so he really surprises with his role in this one his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant br br it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters br br it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre br br 7 10
<START> ok so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955 br br i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbish br br the story is just ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it br br dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy its pathetic br br natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad precedent for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along br br it may've been good for its time but really its drivel br br it must've just been hype about dean's death that has over inflated the reputation of this film
<START> romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing emma ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self appointed matchmaker emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes Âround and love abounds but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and seize the moment br br mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world there may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it's a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place it's light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow br br the winsome paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in love' two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she personifies all things british and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as hard eight ' hush' and a perfect murder' that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it's with characters like emma that she really shines she is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect br br jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl ' in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin firth's mr darcy in the miniseries pride and prejudice ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley br br also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as emma's friend harriet smith and alan cumming as the reverend elton respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre br br the supporting cast includes greta scacchi mrs weston denys hawthorne mr woodhouse sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs goddard phyllida law mrs bates polly walker jane fairfax and ewan mcgregor frank churchill an uplifting elegant film emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 9 10 br br br br
<START> a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy's pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner br br the diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didn't notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect there's the crazy old man jack elam of course who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit there's a blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt a young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly minted husband i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriously br br it's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle there is no discernible depth to it it's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens it's not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses br br i always enjoy it when it's on it's especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm's version of shakespeare's play and here he is with three arms br br oops
<START> while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii england developed a very prolific film industry in the man in the white suit inventor sidney stratton alec guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty unfortunately this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi it's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world if you're planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie
<START> i'll be honest this is one of the worst movies ever if not then it's very close ever seen a bad teen soap opera well this is like one of those except worse for example possibly spoiler girl i wanna go somewhere else br br guy all we need is here br br girl but i wanna take myself somewhere different br br guy i'll take you somewhere else br br proceeding this line they have sex the music is bad pop and bad punk rock if you've ever read the book avoid this movie like the plague they completely change the personalities of the characters and the events additionally they just get rid of things also the movie ends about before the book finishes it is an awful movie so if you haven't read the book don't watch it if you have read the book burn it the movie if you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera go for it then again should we expect anything different from mtv
<START> this movie is great mind you but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly snobby and small minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i don't think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting br br much of what we see might have been normal for the times people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority i can't have our child living this way spare me br br this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of hogwash
<START> hello there br br this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while i would therefore like to salute you all the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance br br i spent 2 years of my life all we greeks did actually analysing omirus epos and not homers as you see everywhere rhyme by rhyme if i recall well it was iliada iliad on 8th grade and odysseia odyssey on 9th grade warner's troy was a big disappointment to me and my fellow greeks around the campus i study in the uk br br iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made it was composed by a greek poet omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war historians put trojan war around 1200 bc and the actual reason of the war not being helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of troy that said one may now understand that omirus epos is not presenting the actual events as it's not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work br br reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour love anger hate heroism discipline loyalty and so on the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle none of these though were revealed in 'troy' br br warner's troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people english finnish and german colleagues of me as well it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work and yet it is wolfgang petersen's best work br br i conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead i would give troy 2 out of 10 it is a really expensive b movie br br cheers br br alex
