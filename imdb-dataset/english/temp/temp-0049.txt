<START> in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america this is the last movie that should be released here being a big fan of asian movies from all genres i was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store br br trust me the action scenes are incredibly disappointing crouching tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences if you're looking for martial arts entertainment your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick br br moreover you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue an absense of action the lack of devloping a tangent plot pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer director dedicated no time in elbaorating and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect br br speaking of which i really don't believe the choreographer of iron monkey did the action sequence in princess blade i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness i just didn't buy it br br please i'm warning you to please do not waste your time money with this movie the premise is intrigueing and the trailer might even tempt you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public maybe in japan but not in the states and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry

<START> some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles br br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk br br it's been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks you've seen it all already br br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip br br awful awful stuff we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid
<START> much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors br br eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancÃ© the fiancÃ© is played by paul rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually pi ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the movie going public is br br grade f
<START> after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of 'stella street' i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed br br i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn't be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again br br spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years' including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers br br in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren't funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do br br if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 4 10
<START> this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lost br br i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth br br the three main actors cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas interacted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions br br all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
<START> i despise horror movies that is no secret no plot bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema and this movie is no exception i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage this particular garbage was released straight to video as i recall as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie i say this all of the phantasm movies all of the jason movies freddy movies chucky movies and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word terrible br br rating phantasm iii 0 5 10
<START> watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994 1997 spider man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out br br i'm from the old school where the 1967 spider man cartoon was the best and still remains the best i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible give me traditional villains please br br the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spider man no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon mini series made me wince dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc ock red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel blanc's son no way can he replicate his dad br br the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are br br the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious like the punisher but why the thing and iron man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you don't tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter's wedding that whole scenario was awful br br last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully ducked the thing's charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 that's why they can't have punching because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other what's wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff they've written out the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves br br kids enjoy these cartoons all you want i've seen enough br br 3 10 rating
<START> this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neo realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias
<START> this star studded british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly cropped so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one as director robert parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once neglecting the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles one mexican officer is shot shaw and landau celebrating and that's it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos savalas although i suspect he was called home to star in kojak as his departure seems arbitrary and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the 1960 hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny horton here but with some lyrics i've never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined fortress with escher style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens landau lettieri and telly savalas as telly savalas i didn't really like this film but i haven't exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
<START> rather than move linearly from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids orbits in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced br br the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major blurts out you're not a crisis fairy are you later watching his lover's naked chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can't even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes bejeweled with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons and you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet br br the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller flattened than they need to be phillip's thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining needy dweeb maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant ungraced by wit or insight it's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether's perimeter br br the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film it does seriously explore 1980's us middle class gay life first encounters courting coupling nesting the complexity of open relationships friction and fracturing dissolution physical abuse rapprochement forgiveness terminal illness death and survival leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear br br could i recommend the film to sticklers for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost parting glances love valour compassion and even jeffrey
<START> james stewart and margaret sullavan play co workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet br br a very charming romantic comedy very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail and the original wins in every way br br this is mandatory viewing each christmas i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem
