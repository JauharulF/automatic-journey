<START> back in the days before the toxic avenger the low camp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhat less low road of producing straight slasher pics i'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self conscious parody br br splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let's see if i can summarize br br after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i don't recall the name but in honor of the title let's call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but don't hold your breath waiting for it there's a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it's back to the asylum and roll credits br br the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffee can sound quality and dialog that just doesn't make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killer's fixation on women the men in this movie are just so deserving i'd've paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriend's roommate or any of the creepy priests there ain't no justice

<START> this movie in away was super clever it's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody br br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came br br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b ch then she's an insecure woman and so on and son on br br normally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesn't have this it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overly inspired rip off unless you hate yourself and you want to die br br 1 2 3 j leonard rollins

<START> i was lucky enough to attend a screening in stockholm for this elegantly expressed enjoyable and thought provoking film with romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in paris navigating the different forms in eighteen separate quartiers but without pouting parisiennes and saccharine formulas its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors' parts Â frustration over only having 5 10 minutes of screen time Â thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party br br debating whether or not i should review all 18 segments i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long winded instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills and certainly you'll find your favourite although gus van sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective his les marais is one of the better contributions even sneaking in a well placed kurt cobain reference the coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve buscemi deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre and perhaps rightly so br br in this way all story lines are exquisitely unique Â filtered through the minds of different directors Â but the one that deviates the most from the rest is vincenzo natali's quartier de la madeleine a dark horror gothic love starring elijah wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of paris in the night who meets a vampiress with a black and white format but blood red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city Â a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film br br yet my single favourite segment was faubourg saint denis by tom tykwer but i think i was conditioned to think so given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying finally that's my favourite director here nevertheless it cannot be denied that tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman for once not annoying that she breaks up with him and he reflects on their relationship as is tywker's style the story is dizzyingly fast paced kinetic and repetitive featuring screaming and running lola rennt making it the most adrenaline pumping segment in paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool Â music br br to fill the negative account clearly not all directors manage as touching as tywker van sant cohens coixet and dÃ©pardieu sylvain chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met they are two lonely mimes this part is so in your face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard looking juliette binoche whom mourns the loss of her son nothing else happens finally the wrap up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half hearted br br yet paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality for all the other stories are well crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing it is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 not saying much i suppose and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite highly recommended both to mainstream of pretentious heh audiences br br 8 out 10

<START> rated pg 13 for violence brief sexual humor and drug content quebec rating 13 should be g canadian home video rating 14a br br i have seen police story a couple of times now in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the protector i have not seen the protector so i cant compare the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film br br runtime 106min br br 9 10
<START> it has been 16 years since it's original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to re release the original 65 episodes i can't fathom why the sci fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scripts the animation was above average quality for it's time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it predated the heavy toon toy tie in market this may have sealed it's doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available
<START> an excellent example of cowboy noir as it's been called in which unemployed michael nicolas cage loses out on a job because he insists on being honest he's got a bum leg with really nothing else he can do he decides that for once he's going to lie when he walks into a bar and the owner wayne the late great j t walsh mistakes him for a hit man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne lara flynn boyle in fine form michael plays along and accepts waynes' money then he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions and accepts her money to get rid of wayne if that didn't complicate things enough the real hit man lyle from dallas dennis hopper in a perfect role for him shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before br br red rock west gets a lot out of the locations director john dahl who co wrote the script with his brother rick was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation it's an appreciably dark and twist laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt have at least been morally compromised like michael the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing even if the writing isn't particularly logical or credible the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in br br cage does a good job in the lead but his co stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed motivated characters hopper boyle and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies in one especially good twist walsh is also the local sheriff and there's an entertaining cameo role for country western star dwight yoakam who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune br br it's quite a good little film worth checking out it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boring br br 8 10
<START> spoilers br br from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10 00 news i wanted to see it i don't remember who it was or which local omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going nebraskan they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann margret when she's swimming in the pool glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only 13 years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable let's just say it was worth the wait br br if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman roy scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time he's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then there's robert trebor's nice name by the way character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear br br after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up br br i don't know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesn't maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover's running around out in l a looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day br br this film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover's place br br another thing i must add how hot are the women in this film wow travolta did right by marrying kelly preston yum we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann margret what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty br br 9 of 10 stars br br so sayeth the hound br br added feb 14 2008 rip roy scheider
<START> the three stooges in a feature length western comedy musical perhaps rockin' in the rockies was meant to combine the stooges comedy short with the western musical in a matinÃ©e if so this was a pleasant way to break up a saturday afternoon jay kirby as rusty is a handsome young hero and mary beth hughes as the blonde june and gladys blake as the brunette betty are pretty women the hoosier hotshots are a harmonious group their songs are quite tuneful however this is the 1940s not the 1950s so the film doesn't exactly rock there are a few laughs but the stooges' brand of humor is more subdued than usual the talking horse is also underutilized br br rockin' in the rockies 4 17 45 vernon keays moe howard larry fine curly howard mary beth hughes
