<START> br br when i first started watching this movie last night on cinemax i was shocked that it had been made cruel intentions in my opinion was one of the best teen oriented films made in years this prequel had certain things incongruent with the original sebastian's father married into wealth then why does he have a rich aunt on long island br br then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie but rather a television series manchester prep after hearing that it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie just as buffy the vampire slayer is different in tv form br br i think that roger kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had after the series wasn't picked up by fox it just seems like something that would happen too fast sebastian becoming the male version of katharyn and i just don't know where they would go with the next episode since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 film which the newer ending is directed right towards br br one thing i didn't like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york and sine katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do marry a man not of her social class br br as a prequel this is fairly lame but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series
<START> 9 11 hosted by robert deniro presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york on september 11 2001 br br never too grisly and gory yet powerful and moving 9 11 is a real treat anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything br br 5 5 stars br br
<START> this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard to find gem it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like spasmo and beyond the darkness unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie br br zombi 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in 1979 similarly compared to zombie zombi 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat the gore is nearly non existent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing br br the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie an idiotic male and his stupid female side kick who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to re animate the dead unless my ears need to be checked i don't even recall a reason for the research of death one it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laugh fest br br anyway death one is experimented on a corpse whom i swear looked like yul brynner and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard the death one toxin is transported outside and is 'hi jacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial br br needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down they find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack br br we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boom box while trailing a trailer load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests can someone say zombie food we also have a sub plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke br br the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie she walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud hello is there anyone here please i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall and the other is swinging a machete after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter br br meanwhile the birds attack the trailer load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place after a matter of hours a day at the most the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack br br the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments this place is a dump she then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie br br unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words for example the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow some even do kung fu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in mid air and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counter part lmao br br the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies we never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off other than that i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies it is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim br br the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital a woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off timeless br br as usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre the megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are about to get killed ie watch for the man chasing a chicken i guess this movie really is a comedy there were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams i'm thirsty thirsty for your blood the costumes are really bad the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same 'asian like' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man br br the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story line a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask me br br regardless this movie does deliver many laughs the gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative the usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make up' consisting of green moss zombi 3 makes for a good rental for a sleep over party or a night of beer and popcorn other than that horror fans should stay away br br 3 out of 10
<START> hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn't without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can't use this word forever but i can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn't rank along the best 7 5 10 bethany cox
<START> rated r for strong language violent content and some nudity quebec rating 13 canadian home video rating 14a br br fear of a black hat is one of the funniest most original comedies i have ever seen its basically a gangsta rap version of the film this is spinal tap its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film if you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like rap music there are not too many comedy films that i give a perfect 10 10 to the only ones i can think of at the moment are this film clerks the world according to garp the 40 year old virgin and chasing amy this film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture the movie is about a woman named nina blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group n w h n z with hats they are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta fear of a black hat is an excellent comedic film and i recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene its a shame this film is not in the top 250 br br runtime 88min br br 10 10
<START> you spend most of this two hour film wondering what's the story regarding the lead character br br will smith as a low key ben thomas will keep you guessing the last 20 25 minutes is when you find out and it's a shocker but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed until then smith plays it mysterious almost stalking people you know he has a good reason for doing it but it's never really explained once again to keep us guessing until the end br br all of it including a on again off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins emily posa might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together br br this is a two hour film and not the typical action packed macho will smith film in fact the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn sad face of smith throughout this story it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots he looks like he's lost weight and is sick smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness br br like a good movie will often do this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits
<START> i had always been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movie i had to see it i was bitterly disappointed this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn't wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e the superhuman strength or determined will it's just one long bad dream i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway i wouldn't waste your time on this
<START> when ben red foxx discovers his wife beatrice pearl bailey has run off with his own brother he rushes to his son norman michael warren to unload his tale of woe only to discover that norman has a secret lover the effeminate garson dennis dugan needless to say ben does not take it well and numerous complications follow including ben's attempt to get norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker tammy dobson unfortunately this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself br br originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam bobrick norman is that you was an absolute disaster on the new york stage to give the play its due i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce the cast played so broadly and in such drop dead manner that it proved quite amusing it is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same br br this is an atrociously performed motion picture red foxx one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century is about as funny here as yesterday's wash michael warren who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect competes with foxx to see who can give the worst performance and pearl bailey is not far behind truth be told only dennis duggan tammy dobson and a cameo by wayland flowers have any spark and sadly that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast br br not only is the film badly performed it looks bad according to film lore this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes and believe me it shows the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of norman and garson's apartment br br some films are so bad that they become funny but norman is that you isn't one of them i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words miss it don't buy it don't rent it don't touch it with a ten foot pole just back away slowly and then run like hell br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr brett's portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in literature jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other the great actor basil rathbone is i must admit a close second but is still second one might make the argument that mr rathbone's screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr brett and to this i would agree however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become sherlock holmes the book should be closed on this subject and we the public left to enjoy mr brett's unique performances br br bill rogers br br sonarman65 yahoo com
<START> i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet that and it had nicole kidman in it i absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking 'wow' br br refreshingly down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner the relationships in the film are believeable with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully the humour is subtle with some great 'office' like scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood br br overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation it's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships brit filmmaking at its best br br 9 10
<START> considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
