<START> i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended it's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the 70's therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it's a precious piece of melbourne history it's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80's soft porn movie it's far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in 1982 so don't expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it it's also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it's great watching her really acting for if you're close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story
<START> gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast a television reporter who travels with her crew karen lamm and lois young to solvang california to cover a danish festival the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller a phenomenal sydney lassick wouldn't you know it ernest and meek partner virginia lelia goldoni are hiding a big secret in their cellar pitiable deformed diaper clad junior stephen furst in a remarkable performance who ultimately terrorizes the girls br br a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour the hotel and the foreboding cellar large echoes of psycho here are great settings most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls the final shot is especially sad br br the unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery br br 8 10
<START> chilling majestic piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an ice cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red poker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind the setting is perfect in a desolate winter hideaway the quietness of the moment is a character in itself as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrance's mind wallows in this idle time and breeds the devil's new playground i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given therein needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims this film is a perfect example of this very thought br br and it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas the clackity clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set mis arrangements that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown i have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit but then again i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe i should keep my two cent criticisms over a superb film to myself all in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity br br rating 9 10
<START> the title says it all br br i'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie br br obviously this movie didn't have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd br br i'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films br br dylan o'leary cast and crew i thank you
<START> i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something br br i'm not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b w picture of phil silvers jackie gleason etc br br bilko was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver's bilko courtesy of bbc2 i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin's travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil silvers i don't know maybe i would have br br some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode if after watching the original ernie colonel hall ritzig emma duane doberman henshaw dino flashman zimmerman mullin et al you still think that steve martin's film is woth anything above a '2' i'll stand you a pint
<START> this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years i will sadly miss it although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit br br the last ever episode of sg1 on television anyway was beautifully done robert wrote something that felt close to reality as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs but over the years they've turned into a family i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms br br sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement the wonderful characters stories directors writers from episode one i was hooked the blend of action science drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more br br there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible br br i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to die br br stargate sg1 1997 2007
<START> okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiot br br i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular mechanics flying car gearhead blood still runs strong and the 3d was pretty effective the cg wasn't pixar quality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half assed late 60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies african american flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noises br br the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichÃ©s 60s gender politics including mostly useless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade two level gross out humour in a movie aimed for imax they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel they didn't get their physics right zero g in the lunar module during landing burn please they couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap br br but we liked the maggots br br so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots uh yay 1 5 5

<START> the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet the movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress bertille noÃ«l bruneau tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox br br part nature documentary and part fairy tale the film focuses on l'infant the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting possibly france though the exact location is never mentioned over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call lily once again and so it goes on days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal and so on br br i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film making contained in that movie luc jacquet is a hugely talented and indeed rare film maker and i was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife this was delivered in spades but here jacquet has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'march' a fictional story br br the child and the fox and the story is simple a young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world without the hint of an adult in sight brilliant so she strikes up a friendship with a fox br br with a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of i'd say six and up or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon not a 31 year old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant wanted and the like but me being the newbie london critic i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child now i have a few problems with this film as a 31 year old lad and loyal lover of all things cinematic i loved the wildlife and landscape photography it's visually stunning the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed as good as you will find on any of attenborough's efforts as an impressionable short attention spanning eight year old i loved about the first half hour then i lost interest it's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending as a 31 year old male i was a little frightened in places wuss br br so it's not a child's film it's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down is it a good family film depends it's educational maybe and the film carries a message it's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer it's hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film it's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks give it a try unsure well i'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then paul heath http www thehollywoodnews com july 2008
<START> 'flight of fury' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film i don't expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters i find it hard to believe that anything close to 12m was spent on this dire mess unless 11m of that 12 was seagal's salary i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that it's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i've endured br br 1 10
<START> rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldn't have been the same dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new crap but the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do r i p rest in peace joey ramone 1951 2001 dee dee ramone 1952 2002
<START> i saw jack frost for Â£4 00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover br br the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only axed you for a smoke and worlds most pi ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be nimble jack be quick jack gouged eyes with candle sticks if you're looking for a for a b movie comedy horror that's full of puns then check jack frost out 10 10
