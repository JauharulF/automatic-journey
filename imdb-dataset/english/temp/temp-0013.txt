<START> i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldn't be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is well just a grade above amateurish it's nothing more than a b or c grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designer br br like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plot's actually ok for a sg flick br br i'll never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness br br too bad i miss kelly lebrock br br jimbo

<START> herbie the volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by maggie peyton lindsay lohan a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion the only thing standing in her way is the current champion trip murphy matt dillon who will do anything to stop them br br the original love bug wasn't that good even as a kid i remember not liking it very much i had some hope for the sequel though i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie unfortunately herbie is no better now than he was before the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 it will probably entertain the kids but that's all br br i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with justin long breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special br br angela robinson directs and she does an okay job she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder in the end herbie is a safe predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid everyone else is better off skipping it rating 4 10
<START> although robert knox benfer has his fans i'm not one of them his films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor br br he's certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb he's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his creation's fame br br benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though he's just a kid with a camera and it shows
<START> 48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting br br people are such suckers for image and looks as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind communism che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about him br br i don't know what's worse being captured by one of che's murder squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isn't why this pet project was made but what took them so long by them i'm referring of course to left wing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even it's a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one sided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and well known communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet br br guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truth bending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big budget political fairy tale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi i e almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment br br the movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3 hour mark so it's quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of che's life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevara's alleged idealism psychopaths don't have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che's earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this over praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4 hour movie br br soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than 90 of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term they're supposedly siding with br br half of all students around the world wear che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self education wouldn't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his her face to the world wearing che's by now clichÃ© image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those che wearers probably know more about marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about fidel castro's dead ally br br after everything that'd been done in the name of marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn stalin mao kim il pol pot castro milosevic ceausescu the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and or mentally through this system so none of that matters huh br br the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work and vote hint sean penn headed a jury not long ago br br

<START> orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan richard harris his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken robert carradine comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale this raises nolan's interest in killer whales decides he want's to catch one of them instead however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess enrages her mate nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least kills one of nolan's crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town it's people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death br br directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip off was terrible i'm sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes the script by producer luciano vincenzoni sergio donati is so stupid i'm lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale's are just one more time i'll scream i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to sink it i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there i don't believe a killer whale can identify someone's house know someone is in there then wreck it on purpose i don't believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat i don't believe killer whales can physically recognise people i don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out maybe i'm being a bit harsh i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan hand or should that be fin deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold seriously that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film i found the film very boring totally dull had awful character's with no on screen presence at all it goes without saying this is a jaws 1975 rip off which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic br br director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater totally forgettable there's no build up to them virtually no pay off either as orca doesn't get to eat a single person then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' 'caring' couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn hilarious stuff the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland boring instead of footage which matches enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else do you get the impression that i don't like this film good forget about any gore or decent deaths either there's a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it br br this probably had quite a big budget it still sucks there's nothing outstanding about orca it's well made i suppose but flat bland totally forgettable the cinematography is quite nice though the acting is bad rampling is awful the late harris' irish accent is embarrassing br br orca is a lame jaws rip off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielberg's film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws the revenge 1987
<START> this movie is spoofed in an episode of mystery science theater 3000 i think mst3k was at its best when they ripped this movie br br terrible acting bad makeup poor effects chick in skimpy 1960's underwear i give it a 2 br br the villain is hard to understand due to the makeup the assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like nachoo think sneezing it's just poor oration the long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters br br i still don't know what 'the projected man' means in terms of the plot i missed some of the beginning though br br what is up with this 10 line minimum on posting
<START> this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable gotcha at the end of each really there is no character development and no real plot to speak of there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm and his ghost mom with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like the ring take down a bunch of cardboard cut out two dimensional excuses for human characters br br this english language version of the grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food satisfying momentarily but not really what you ought to be living on br br not recommended
<START> thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever seen br br i can't even think of a close second and i've seen some really bad movies br br absolutely nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i've seen better on youtube here's some typical dialogue br br steve steve steve is that you steve i'm not kidding steve this isn't funny steve are you there steve steve steve br br arggh ahhhhhh nooooooo
<START> dark wolf quick review let's get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it it's just an awful movie it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane f cking hodder someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career br br anyway former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of near rampant nudity but that's about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence we're presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation the first playstation the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 2 10 br br www residenthazard com
