<START> valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of it br br acting very bad katherine heigl can not act the other's weren't much better br br story the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failed br br music yes some of the music was pretty cool br br originality not very original the name paige prescott' recognize prescott br br bottom line don't see valentine it's a really stupid movie br br 1 10 br br
<START> spoiler alert br br soooo arnie's really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders he's sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while he's caught once again this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys br br i really wanted to like this movie being an arnie fan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me e g the reconstruction of arnie's fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with 5 10 different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members one of which inside the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats br br there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns br br the acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad br br the special effects are ok without being impressive br br rating 3 10
<START> this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries br br watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room br br dan basinger 8 10
<START> a small funny film it is totally incredible unbelievable impossible but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is absurdly silly but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning one think is sure too security in english airports is not exactly what it should be but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage a real plague on modern airports and don't expect to get fair compensation or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener funny isn't it dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> i passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if i was missing something the other night it was on one of the movie channels and i tuned in i missed nothing br br i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 i seriously doubt it br br the lead character starts the movie in classic i don't know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get sued it's not funny it's not even remotely funny others have commented on the san franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written get over yourself in fact i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film don't assume familiarity with your audience familiarity is earned much like respect br br from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp i didn't realize he's jewish it's a discredit to jewish comedians to call this jewish humor it's just unfunny humor just because you're jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy a wasp spalding gray does a better job of self analytical humor than this guy so obviously it's not about ethnicity br br if one of the bits i had seen had worked i might have stuck around but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesn't make a great movie br br this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of office space don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing just say no to haiku tunnel
<START> i have recently watched this movie twice and i can't seem to understand why the h ll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitler's environment and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late 1890's wwi and the inter war period what i can't understand is why they pictured hitler as a 100 pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in heaven's name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn us br br i absolutely don't think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive not to mention austrians and a lot of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization not the fact hitler was such a 'weirdo' if it would have been like the makers make us believe i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader not to mention reichskanzler br br 4 10
<START> there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don't know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming you're a super crime fighting valentine br br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nigh invulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates' mother br br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentine's day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspect br br here's problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds don't turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds he's not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentine's day party just because it's february doesn't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip br br the slasher in valentine dresses in head to toe black with a cherub's mask here's problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple it's not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isn't even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when you're not scratching your head you're yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if you're alone on valentine's day find something anything else to do you'll be glad you did
<START> this movie is just great it's entertaining from beginning to the end you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics br br sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy gabe walker together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john lithgow one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain br br and the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action br br brilliant movie

<START> suppose you've been on a deserted island the last ten years haven't heard of scream and left when halloween part 1 entered the cinema then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene br br at the moment a 2 7 rating is on imdb and it doesn't deserve a that low appreciation slashing all the way like i know what you did and a who is it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who and why br br no big surprise just a nice flick to watch with a cola popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot deep characters if the video rental is out of the top titles you can take it without a risk but don't expect a masterwork i've seen a lot worse
<START> on paper this movie would sound incredibly boring the idea of a 75 year old man traveling the country side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight story br br the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl she's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out alvin tells her a story about his own kids long ago he had them each take a stick and break it which they could easily do then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them that bundle he said is family so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger the straight story realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions br br alvin's journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly un hollywood character interactions each interaction is full of warmth and humor and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother lyle who has suffered a stroke and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey it's a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and ours it's a slow simple relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of america br br the straight story is the rare live action g rated movie that truly should not be missed grade a
<START> it was 9 30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought ''holy sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons'' but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it's a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead br br the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv 14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well i've got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four times br br all in all i don't mind father of the pride i don't hate it but i don't like either i've seen way better from ''the simpsons'' br br 3 5 10
