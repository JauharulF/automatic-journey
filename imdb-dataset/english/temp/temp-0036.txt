<START> the main problem with power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever it gets boring after awhile sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward you could probably pass it all off as character development but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie or are just simply to flat and uninteresting lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom he should have cut a few of the characters hackman the wife and concentrated harder on others billings it could have been a great hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting a fact that amazed me considering the cast even gene hackman performance wasn't up to par denzel washington is the only real actor of note here gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere br br sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies i e serpico and stop trying to recapture his success with 12 angry men and fail safe it hasn't worked yet sidney and it most likely never will leave the ensemble dramas to altman br br 3 10 br br
<START> sadly it's true legiunea strÃ¤inÃ¤ exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc's irreversible failure br br as it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story line the script's level is similar to a cÃ¢ntarea romÃ¢niei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism only turned upside down while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology the ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level br br unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets he isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar his level of story telling in film images is similar to phrasing something like holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976 1984 who had created unique works as cursa proba de microfon vÃ¢nÃ¤toarea de vulpi and even croaziera and glissando sic transit gloria mundi
<START> this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon the sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council it is rather long about two hours but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges it will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience
<START> a long film about a very important character from south africa stephen biko he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time the already old film though does not show how important biko was what he really represented his life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks the film being from 1987 the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are in 1987 to show this the film has to look beyond biko's death hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to publish the first book on biko after his death and that can only happen in england the film shows a way to escape south africa while apartheid is still standing and killing so do not expect this way to be realistic and true it could not be but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the indians panegyric books or films all have that defect they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view that explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all a remake is necessary br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines cegid
<START> the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now we've all heard or read about it in some kind of con text what would you do if you were all alone in the world what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes in fact the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew two room mates living in a run down house in the middle of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed just until br br straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn't dare going out of the house dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don't treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happens br br the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left br br nothing features an incredibly small cast in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we don't see it right away br br obviously this can't be an event driven film and it's not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and that's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar br br now one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less it's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it's more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as andrew claims it's fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society br br one of the best parts of the film is the set production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching br br however the very best part of the film is the acting both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent one liners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end and this really moves the movie away from the low budget area to well crafted handwork br br let's talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film there's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the drews have milked that scene completely it's still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear br br nothing is a bright and well lit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we don't know where they are or what has happened to them we don't know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it could've been it's rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end it's a reasonably satisfactory one br br take hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and andrÃ© bijelic having been room mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end it's almost like one of the cube prequels br br what can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well made with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing 2 i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to be br br final rating 7 5 10
<START> the progression of the plot is enough to rope one in and create curiosity about the outcome however ultimately the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it if the intention was to create a perpetual circle occasionally done in the twilight zone it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort
<START> i think hollow point is a funny film with some good moments i have never seen before in action movies well both tia carrere and thomas ian griffith aren't so good in acting but tia carrere is nice and good looking girl isn't it but donald sutherland is superb in his role so so mad gangster
<START> i commend pictures that try something different many films just seem like re treads of old ideas so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico br br the movie is set just after ww2 and the post war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners barmy the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico they too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago with this document they reason they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want since it turns out they really aren't british subjects where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you'll need to see for yourselves leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem
<START> in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice br br michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock central australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area no one believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an accessory after the fact the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing the chamberlain's trial was over before it began br br lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the chamberlains should have been acquitted br br fred schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson's novel that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock br br schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay his screenplay co written with robert caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred br br the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was streep's is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part br br technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the rock editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce smeaton provides a telling score br br for all aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said i don't think anybody really understands what innocence means to innocent people br br saturday may 20 1995 video br br even on return viewings fred schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980 is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving br br schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson's novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down br br amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence br br meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn't cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling support br br editing from jill bilcock is very timely ian baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton's music is perfect for the part truly a must for all conscientious australians br br sunday june 15 1996 video

<START> for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack lack of dialogue clichÃ©s up the wazoo and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film look no farther dreamworks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent or really wanted to create an animated episode of national geographic either way they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie spirit stallion of the cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults and also fails to entertain despite the oh so cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans after looking past the wonderful animations what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess br br spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful as he is a horse that cannot be tamed calmed nor controlled because of this he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high spirited horses which includes his mom but his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country during this spirit never actually named that throughout the entire film almost befriends a courageous native american and a fellow female horse and also has a lot of run ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up br br why must movies mix computer animation with traditional it comes off looking rather meshed something spirited away suffered from as well best example is when a train is chasing after spirit you see the hand drawn spirit running from a computer animated train it would look much better if it were one or the other but not both unless you can really pull off some nice effects beauty and the beast's famous dance sequence uses computer animation but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie the opening sequence was the best looking part of the film kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality a little scene has multiple i mean multiple similar shots of just a general's face quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion br br the kids might enjoy this flick but with lack of dialog song and motivation it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one bryan adams has no place in this movie and why does hans zimmer stay away from using a western theme in this movie when it is a story taking place in the old west soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me at least they are using realistic noises of horses two points for that yet if you are going to refrain from making horses talk why even have a narrator interrupt every so often which just so happens to be the main character himself br br native americans are nice and the western folks are evil native killing horse torturing rowdy psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed more or less this is what spirit is showing us it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the wild west they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives now the person spirit befriended happened to betray him on more than one occasion yet that is forgivable apparently because he is not a soldier that or because he has the sassy female horse br br spirit isn't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk wreaking havoc and even perhaps resulting in some off screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no spirit is in trouble this film gets quite rhythmic as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains kicking people around destroying property freeing horses and then getting captured again all in this same order too the writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie for an old west film they certainly have very little room to roam br br bottom line this is most certainly no disney movie as a matter of fact that is a bad thing even though it was what they were aiming for so instead of the typical musical we get a boring film that becomes predictable dull and slow in multiple instances even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in everything about this movie was just wrong from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil buffoons to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off kill bill vol 2 which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west has more of a western feel than this movie do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary thank you
