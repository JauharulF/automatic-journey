<START> a french film ester williams would love but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves no question where sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as animaux but actually only the 3 girls are in focus and for the entire time with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background marie is a stick of a girl unattractive but determined she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer and she is also a friend of convenience to anna not unattractive but for her the time of her body's perfection was short and now she is an adolescent in a women's body what ensues is a journey to self realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un natural where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth while the dÃ©nouement was breath taking with floriane's self absorption beautifully portrayed as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne it all seemed abstract sciamma's puppets
<START> i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasn't weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed pufnstuf rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an 10 year old when i first saw the movie not in 1970 i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still 'feel' the evil woods witchy poo was scary i wouldn't want to cross her path
<START> this is a dumb movie maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much but i just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn br br i didn't have any beef with the acting but i thought the characters were awful the movie starts off with clive owen's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later oh yeah he also tells us he's in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you're long gone before the police show up but clive owen's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as i can tell he also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a this old house job on the bank's stockroom and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me clive this plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so br br and then there are the many unexplained details why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages who the hell is jodie foster's character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn't have to tell denzel washington her agenda because it's above his pay scale how dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery how did the robbers slip away and why did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank chairman's past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box why the hell would clive owen let in jodie foster or the cops since when do they make toy ak 47s that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamond br br none of these questions are ever answered there are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off screen but i never felt that way about inside man it felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that's weak particularly annoying is jodie foster's character who won't disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is we're just supposed to take her word for it i guess br br the only reason i gave this movie two stars is i laughed at denzel's taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kid's outrageous video game other than that this movie has no redeeming features
<START> ok this one's a weirdy honestly i can't tell you all the inner plot points of the beast cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes but just wait it definitely does pick up br br the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day eventually you see the beast which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat bear costume with a horse cock attached to it the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared the beast pops up rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast's attention which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere yeah i've got a twisted foot fetish so sue me the whole film is told in flashbacks and long winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious a shocking but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film br br the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate the cinematography itself is quite eye catching and the sets costumes and locations are elaborate the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat bear a good bit of tits ass and hairy 70's french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film i have to honestly say that if it weren't for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden this film would have been a real bore that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex the beginning has a very up close and personal scene of two horses boning including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina yum but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they've seen it all the beast rape really is out there and something to be witnessed also recommended to any fans of 70's 80's sleaze films this one ranks pretty high with them worth a look for you sick rat bear beastiality lovers out there like me 8 10
<START> nb spoiler warning such as it is br br first off this is a teen slasher flick the spam in a cabin genre as joe bob briggs piquantly put it if you're looking for roshambo this isn't it and wasn't going to be it i'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performances br br secondly this wasn't zuniga's first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn br br thirdly you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof and the harvest time is now br br except this one gives the chop to the sweet virginal protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the lass too much credit br br then again this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one movie actors in history of the nineteen credited actors a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film three appeared in one other movie by the same producers only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits what was this the has been and never were mutual aid society br br granted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne br br 2 10

<START> after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie i knew what was supposed to happen i had high expectations of the movie because of the rating the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie i have a couple main points for not liking this movie br br spoilers br br 1 the casting jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character also i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy i pictured wendy much differently i can see why they picked jack nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but he's not supposed to really look 'evil' he's supposed to look normal and he turns evil also they make one of the worst movie couples danny was alright he needed more life though he acted way to droney br br 2 the screenplay they cut out so many things that were in the book and added things some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing the hedge animals the roque mallet the elevator were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours i was extremely irritated br br 3 the ending the ending was changed completly halorann died jack froze to death wendy never got hurt the overlook didn't blow up the ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly i was apalled hallorann was never supposed to die but jack killed him with an ax if they wanted to kill him at least have jack use a roque mallet you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie br br there are other things that i didn't like about the movie but there are things that were all right the camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator didn't happen in the book was cool but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all i reccomend reading the book before you see this movie i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more i would never have done that i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day i can't wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the hedge animals br br rating 2 10
<START> i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution br br now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie br br prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the 80's so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame br br 9 10

<START> although the actors were good specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary a famous theatre director hilmir snÃ¦r guÃ°nason becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his destiny lilly being sightless since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and ears here this movie is becoming a roadmovie and the longer the road becomes the closer their relation develops which was predictable since the beginning of the film the theatre director is on the road to his mother jenny grÃ¶llmann his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations of course what should she do other and she is still living because she is waiting his son to die my god this are destinies br br finally the son arrived mum is celebrating a big party at the beach wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune yes they are celebrating her farewell the son arrives just in time mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german while the son is answering with a rough accent because the son is unable to see he is not falling in love to the nurse the film script would have become also too complicate but is looking for lilly on the way back to home br br parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her who has first to booze himself to courage the occasion is favourable because mum tina engel is on journey together with the lover of lilly paul harald schrott they are after lilly to bring her back paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love because the film script would have become too complicate the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too i would suggest an architect or a pianist or course a famous one when they finally find lilly they want to convince her to come back to paul because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her but lilly felt in love to his pupil the theatre director did i mention that he was even a famous theatre director br br this is german film art as you may see in this pretentious production that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films this film is really embarrassing i have the impression that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit being a co producer i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness barfuss already the spelling of the title is not right barfuss dvd cover writes proudly a til schweiger film this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw filmfÃ¶rderung hamburg and the ffa br br please don't spoil your time with this film there are really good films in germany watch out for film directors like marcus h rosenmÃ¼ller joseph vilsmaier hans steinbichler hans christian schmid faith akin
<START> the movie starts with a pair of campers a man and a woman presumably together hiking alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and slashes her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer br br we next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date sparking the token blonde's ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lost br br in the next scene we realize that this isn't just another the burning clone but a ghost story the women scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they've seen her children before disappearing of course br br the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace daddy's going hunting the little girl exclaims with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isn't a ghost like his children br br freaked out by something in the woods the token blonde splits running blindly into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains he's starving and it will be quick this doesn't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier maybe he's allergic are panthers honestly even in california she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where papa resides clearly someone lives here because there's a fire and something weird is roasting over it the children appear and warn them of papa who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrives br br for whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but daydreams about it we aren't given the reason for the children's demise the men go to sleep and are left unharmed the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friends br br the following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is going br br overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and that's being generous for all its misgivings the musical score is well done it's still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the toad 6 miles away i can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on br br alan skip bannacheck
