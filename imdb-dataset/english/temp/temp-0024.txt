<START> the movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made i've watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless br br and the film has some gem lines scenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you i've been out of high school for uhhh some years and it's not following me the famous static line i'm getting some static not as much as you're going to get as principal togar approaches the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses the nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before cd's and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you're ramones br br just one piece of advice don't look up where the stars are now joey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all age pj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele br br so watch and enjoy don't think just have fun
<START> the feel of this movie was amazing adam sandler's performance was very inspiring as he played a very rattled and fragile character he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role his character was really interesting i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me for someone who plays primarily comedy roles he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input i especially loved the scene in which adam and don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city i familiarized with the moment because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all with his video games music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts this movie is definitely worth the watch
<START> i love john saxon in anything he's in the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled please do not watch this movie called zombie death house the 1000 dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70's cheese legend ray being the front man at retromedia ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon just plain bad now the both of them and boring besides it's great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house the word zombie sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f o r the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon if you wanna see real saxon pick up black christmas nightmare on elm street or the glove
<START> rock star john norman howard kris kristofferson turns lounge singer esther hoffman barbra streisand into an overnight singing star esther's star rises while john's goes into decline thanks to drugs and alcohol after about two hours john does the self destructive red converible 160 mph crack up on a desert highway thing the best thing about this movie is the music especially the song evergreen barbra streisand sings well but you can't take her seriously as an up and coming star when she is already a star the very first time she appears singing in a back alley bar she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career she is too confident too professional her apartment looks like a page out of apartment living not some hole in the wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live br br kris kristofferson handles the self centered out of control rock star role like well like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent the direction is tepid the story is slow and dull br br but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story it's the hair after staring at kristofferson's and streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2 hours your eyes hurt
<START> i liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much longer story since the book is over 400 pages that makes sense it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional south american country also a lot to fit into the time available i think it would have been much better as a six hour mini series than it turned out as a 140 minute movie br br even though it's rushed the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing what is told is told fairly well one fault is that clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie or they should have been left out two more faults which could be spoilers esteban's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and ferula's curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever br br the acting is excellent glenn close as the tormented spinster ferula is outstanding jeremy irons as the brutal self made rich man is also excellent meryl streep as the main character clara is great although she's often even better than she was in this movie there were many well performed smaller roles too the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent
<START> review may contain spoilers br br predictable campy bad special effects it has a tv movie feeling to it the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible the premise is interesting but its excution falls waaaay short if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this at least make it a quality one i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago and there isn't really much to say about this film other than skip it
<START> a very strong movie bruce is good and brad also br br as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered br br that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job br br well novikov property seems to me work in this movie however i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity br br so bruce could save the world but not his world br br in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself br br and i do believe there is no problem in that here i disagree with dr brown from back br br but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor his girlfriend was just lost br br a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future the bullet well it might be some mistake some falsification br br well i like this movie has to buy a dvd br br best
<START> matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle powers boothe in his fbi office he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi when agent doyle arrives in the office he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother agent doyle requests some evidence and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood they were a simple family of three his widow father meiks bill paxton his brother and himself one night his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen br br i watched this movie four months ago on vhs and yesterday i watched again now on dvd although being a low budget movie the screenplay is sharp with no flaw the cast is outstanding but i would like to highlight the performance of matt o'leary as the young felton it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager the direction of bill paxton is remarkable there is no explicit violence in this horror movie a great debut behind the camera i regret the brazilian title of this movie 'a mÃ£o do diabo' the devil's hand' if at least it were 'the god's hand' it might be acceptable but calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous brent hanley the screenwriter did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian distributor this film is highly recommended my vote is eight br br title brazil a mÃ£o do diabo the devil's hand
<START> early film directed by d w griffith it features a gloriously happy king arthur v johnson and his queen marion leonard but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel henry b walthall when the king discovers the lovers he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe type revenge it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy the lovers and quiet the cement mixers the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow br br the sealed room 9 2 09 d w griffith arthur v johnson henry b walthall marion leonard
<START> as a fan of paris je'taime i went to see new york i love you with very high expectations i gladly walked out with all my expectations met it was funny sweet fast paced and entertaining the film starts out with two cab hoppers bradley cooper justin bartha trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go that was funny and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones those four i will start talking about one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom thirbly's character being handicapped the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing and writing a skit about a caretaker and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker new york i love you is definitely as good if not better than the 2006 paris je'taime the skits are well paced and the film shows how indie films should really be the film however does not have as many famous directors as paris je'taime which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence if you want to laugh see some great dramatic effects see an amazing amount of great performances and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york i love you
