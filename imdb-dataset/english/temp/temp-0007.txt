<START> who me no i'm not kidding that's what it really says on the video case br br plot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each other br br find ariel where's ariel can't find ariel she's right behind you you idiot br br most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks like br br a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virus hologram vr witch glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figure br br this isn't really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail 1950's easy rider trail film noir's night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasy land none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz doesn't work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches long br br nothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this work br br this is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one liners including the line about french kissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps not br br the original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters aren't either but that's beside the point haha br br what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull horror alien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of a uh green look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot br br another odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i don't mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about 1 16th the size of the screen wow
<START> i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i'll check it out br br oh man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity br br cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was clerks and it became a cult classic and a franchise br br 2 10
<START> awful absolutely awful no plot no point no end it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch every day i'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it i'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like benigni roger i'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one br br
<START> malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light br br honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast the kills are raw and eerie its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale several elements like the visitor with the camera the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story anyway i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette although its a turn off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of one missed call which was worn off and useless already in the miike version

<START> it's got christopher lee it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises it's got volcanoes evil aliens disguised as nuns tidal waves earthquakes exploding cars exploding coffee machines and as a climax the entire planet blows up how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly mind numbingly dull the answer my friend is because 90 of this movie is made up of establishing shots most of them involving long tracks pans or zooms in combinations or occasionally all three that do nothing except give the crew something to do there are endless shots of our protagonists driving getting in and out of cars driving again walking around looking at stuff getting in cars and driving i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering say something please somebody just say something do something anything br br the dialogue when it does come is terrible br br maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours was a typically meaningless line the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage justified in this speech from lee as the head alien br br the planet earth has emitted an over abundance of diseases they are contaminating the universe all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed br br this is is neanderthal sf script writing this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds it is and i collect such things the most god awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters br br lee who always struck me as a smart useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek i don't blame him
<START> cause it's crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera work count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible i'd bet 10 they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainment stare at a wall
<START> there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply defies description something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth which kills them or turns them into zombies the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet i'm not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle br br the film is total trash surreal bad trash spectacularly one of a kind bad trash there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there which aren't very hot or erotic there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula which had me rolling on the floor br br definitely one of the worst movies ever made up there with the equally wretched direct to home video boardinghouse or boogeyman ii both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on
<START> with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affair if you add the fact that b gazzara and miss a hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration if this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love n y paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picture mr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs is of minimal importance it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors from targets onwards there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors principally who the hell's in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin as eclectic as the city it portrays mr b s golden boy image was sure to tarnish for such is the nature of the movie business but it is equally sure one day to be restored and when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
<START> this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing
<START> a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west indies for a hidden fortune the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the treasure's location the deep sea divers hope to track down the gold but find that greed and hatred leads to murder according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis manfish is the name of their boat not a monster the skeleton who gives muscular captain john bromfield as brannigan his half of the treasure map is very good old salt victor jory as professor provides the other half of the map first mate lon chaney jr as swede plays dumb and sexy tessa prendergast as alita guards the rum not very well obviously serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture which otherwise might have amounted to something br br manfish 2 56 w lee wilder john bromfield victor jory lon chaney jr
