<START> this is a low budget scream style movie maddy is a new worker at a conspicuously unnamed office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co worker chris during a hot tub party chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a murder club where everyone has killed someone for kicks when maddy loses it and kills someone for real hijinks ensue br br the film looks good and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level nudity gore maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast but after the credits roll you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
<START> this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles it is too far fetched and at some points ridiculous if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts which i might add are poorly done and wish you were some warrior to the casting in this movie wasn't very good and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all on a scale of 1 10 10 being excellent 1 being horrible the acting in this movie is a 4 brenda song is talented in comedy but with this kind of movie in some of the more serious scenes her acting was laughable when she made some of her fighting poses i started laughing out loud i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing for example the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing how her voice turns dark and evil i think that was incredibly stupid and how wendy's brenda song teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks that was pretty ridiculous to so to sumamrize it all a disappointing movie but okay if you're 10 or under
<START> this story is dedicated to women according to the introduction who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose leaf system when politics was filmed the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote was only a decade old and the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group advocating prohibition and shutting down speakeasies was a main concern for women at the time br br good natured marie dressler as hattie burns becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy she wants the liquor selling joints closed and is drafted into a mayoral run after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally ms dressler is supported by her tenants best friend polly moran as ivy higgins and her stuttering husband roscoe ates as peter higgins dressler's run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town so dressler orders the women to go on strike denying them everything in the parlor bedroom and bath br br the film sounds much better than it turned out the humor frankly isn't too good and it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations you look like madame queen refers to an amos and andy character and the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well this time producers might have considered making the film more dramatic focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell as benny emerson and karen morley as myrtle burns br br politics 7 25 31 charles reisner marie dressler polly moran roscoe ates
<START> bizarre trippy forget about a story and full steam ahead low budget sci fi about the williams family living in the california desert they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness apparently they've been caught in a time space warp where past present and future collide br br this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects a constant light and sound show dinosaur like creatures that have at each other a friendly and tiny little e t who enchants the granddaughter and so on this picture does show off a little imagination if nothing else br br very nice music by richard band engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen randall william cook and peter kuran and importantly a likable family are key assets it generates a sense of child like amazement it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids or the kids inside many of us who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation br br i found it hard to resist it's a short and sweet 80 minutes diversion and a decent credit for director john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders fame and executive producer charles band br br 7 10

<START> as is well known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this herr graf's silent rants during summertime aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well hordes of coarse people taking their ease such bizarre travels around the world also happen in three ages a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands namely herr buster keaton and herr eddie cline br br obviously this german count liked most the first segment focused on the stone age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time preferring that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of rome it should have included the cause of the fall of the roman empire that is to say barbarians or the same thing germans of course the third segment takes place during modern times but this teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern br br the leitmotiv that moves herr keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages is the search for love a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self interest every time that three ages is shown in the schloss theatre it is always a pleasure to watch a funny witty silent film even for a serious german count an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets puns pratfalls and acrobatics visual and astounding technical tricks an absolute silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse summertime severities br br and now if you'll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must flirt with an old teutonic heiress who doesn't look her age br br herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com
<START> this movie is a mess but at least it's not pretentious the box art for the video markets it as a fun throwback to 1950s giant bug movies in reality it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of aliens br br the producers clearly wanted to make an alien picture but they mustn't have had much money in fact it doesn't look like they had any money really i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing br br the basic plot is retained group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons i presume instead of setting the film in space where no one can hear you scream they set the film in a hospital where everyone can see your budget laid bare the amusing thing about blue monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is the filmmakers didn't abandon the alien aesthetics even though we're in a hospital we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted in this case the venerable growth hormone plot device the annex also doubles as a boiler room or something so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi leveled steel catwalks perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats br br the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location he touches it and says ow so we know he's been hurt the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth i guess in an alien picture this would be called the mouthburster the worm is isolated but some naughty little kids leukemia patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth hormone you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi convincing insectoid arms the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi offscreen monster semi obscured by the semi darkness br br which brings us back to alien how you ask can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the alien movies no problem a power outage or something causes the electrical system to go awry which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less than special effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking they don't move too well and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy br br ok so what alien bases haven't we covered oh water dripping down the walls check we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts then send some of the characters through the damp drippy basement to get to the other side problem solved we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots and don't forget the fog well you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies do you ok maybe inside of a hospital you do so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark burn br br i haven't said anything about the negligible acting not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow i take it blue monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun and if so then it is a nice try but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag see a film called return of the aliens the deadly spawn if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right with even less money and even more marginal acting talent this one falls flat on its alien
<START> i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say this it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approach br br plot br br simply stated it's not boring most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they don't take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man they're screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie br br characters br br i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that br br choco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to domino's lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic br br rourke's character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to live br br claremont ladies i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this child's illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help br br the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting br br christopher walken 90210 guys br br they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has beens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable br br cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different br br granted this movie isn't for everyone but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously
<START> these type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years making it hard for the movies to still stand out really br br also this movie received little publicity aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little french movie as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies the film premiered at cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well br br the movie doesn't really stand out from others since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that naissance des pieuvres is a bad one to watch the movie is certainly a good watch that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively in a typical somewhat slow french cinematic pace br br it's a coming of age movie that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid teenagers sexuality is a big theme within the movie which gets handled delicately and subtle it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one though perhaps a bit predictable since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre br br this type of french movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty with deep layers and meanings to it naissance des pieuvres however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into euro teen movies to appreciate this movie it's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie due to its subject and visual approach br br the movie is also being made realistic by its actors who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles the strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments br br a good movie on its subject br br 7 10
<START> this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever br br 1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how br br 2 not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day br br 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned away br br please for the love of everything holy don't rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public
<START> i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible but it was far from great mediocre at absolute best i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time think about armageddon and deep impact volcano and dante's peak night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects br br i have nothing against the actors who starred in it even if they weren't great it was the movie itself the directing the special effects the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage br br i really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt
