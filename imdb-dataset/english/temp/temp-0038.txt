<START> the idea behind this film was a good one too bad it wasn't written well casting sidney poitier as the fbi agent was a good idea and he did an outstanding job tom berenger on the other hand only knows one emotion in most of his movies anger kirstie alley's character could have been a great one and even showed some possibilities once but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be i don't care for alley's acting anyway the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did the director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action i will keep this in my collection only as an example of poitier's performances
<START> from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it played by bertille noel beuneau br br the story's frankly quite simple and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust and how they go about hanging around each other dealing with respective adversaries and the likes here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picture postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture br br but while we indulge in wistful scenery the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a leveler in food the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course while i thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a prey br br between the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it otherwise it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers br br as a film i would've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins but i guess the way it was resented probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel bruneau and the multiple foxes that played renard
<START> i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane movie buying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though it's been some months since i watched it br br it's a striking film set in italy somewhere around the 15th century definitely medieval era though i don't think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well br br flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she's immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but she'll continue to see him in her dreams br br her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open air insane asylum the residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped br br the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig sty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavia's views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example then contemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in 1974 revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees br br flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle gear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil br br is she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era weren't big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new boss br br this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a mass audience movie at all to be sure it's quite good though and doesn't belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think there's much value in the final film and i'm glad i saw it
<START> home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies it's the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious br br first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff br br the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i didn't laugh or even so much as smile once rather i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying br br the acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they've been hastily picked off the street and well that's it br br i can see some people saying man it's for the kids don't dis it man well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this br br so in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone 3 ever it's that bad br br 0 5 stars
<START> i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him i was wrong it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven i really don't care what young lassies from scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take visually the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts 1 that's all there is 2 now i see why her boyfriend killed himself rename it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i'm such a sucker for sticking these things out
<START> as a grownup in my mid 40s i am not even close to any of nancy drew 's key demographics but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon so i could tell were the pair of sixtyish silver haired ladies down the row from me the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20 ish female usher who said she'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it br br more to the point however in the row just ahead of me there were nine count them nine ten year old girls lined up next to each other passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews br br once the film began they promptly settled down to watch br br and didn't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll br br this is not a perfect film it doesn't quite pay off its high school subplots it's not quite confident enough of its own tone and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times but the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful the plot hangs together fairly well and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization last but not least emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace josh flitter's superb timing notwithstanding this is roberts' movie and she pulls it off beautifully her nancy drew is very much the direct ancestor of kristen bell's veronica mars and the film is also a lineal descendant of jodie foster's early and underrated candleshoe br br in today's marketplace it's a rarity a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence as such it won't be to everyone's taste but for what it is it is the best movie of its kind in decades
<START> this is an attempt by both author edgar rice burroughs and filmmakers at an arabian tarzan of the apes but this desert set film shows none of the majesty present in burroughs' more successful jungle adventure the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall as el 'lion chatham and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke as princess eulilah with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge the opening states that although guilty of conduct unbecoming the lad's mother is living but she never re enters the picture unfortunately the lion man has deteriorated and is looks like it's missing footage br br the lion man 1936 john p mccarthy jon hall kathleen burke ted adams
<START> i should qualify that title now that i think about it checkout is not entirely worthless i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense so i guess it's worth something for that and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word not a single original thought went into this movie which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie it is definitely not the next clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done i even heard someone groan in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made
<START> overall performance at last the long waiting aag hits the screens unfortunately it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of his career with siva in telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots the shot division is lame characters couldn't carry an emotion performances are not to their mark storytelling is worse background is really really terrible br br babban amitabhz been over prioritized to his job varma produced great villains like bikumatre bhavtakur das mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema there's no comparison of gabbar with babban babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother it's a gift in this movie amitabhz performance is not to his mark his appearance itself is pathetic the scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema what ever they worked on babban is not successful babban is no comparison with gabbar br br narsimha the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands if varma did that it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder itz good he opened the secret early but the flashback is pathetic varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark br br durga the only character with betterment this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story br br heroo raj ghunguroo no body bothers or at least considers these character the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz these characters carry nothing to this movie br br ramgopalvarma his quality is degrading diminishing aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra aag never carried an emotion with its characters storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters don't compare aag with sholay still u will not like it br br if you dare watch this movie you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag
<START> i'm sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet those bazookas need serious site calibration
<START> i loved the story somewhere a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film well maybe there ought to be i thought everybody seemed really human and believable what a top notch cast what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this film br br steve carell br br he really showed a nice subtle depth that touched me he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first at the cost of denying his own needs br br did he act like a petulant ass why yes he did br br and you see that's what was perfect about this film the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something and not simply acting like he was feeling something and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling and what he was feeling was denied br br denied happiness br br denied fulfillment br br denied love br br losing your love is painful beyond belief and many who do so will never feel something like that again br br beautiful film br br i gave it an eight out of ten
<START> all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison there s also a storyline involving a murder br br i will be honest and confess that i wasn t too taken by the movie since i m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it s got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent br br i ll be very surprised if this movie doesn t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they re doing
