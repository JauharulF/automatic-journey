<START> i went in to see d war on a whim and with very low expectations the movie failed to meet them br br i don't mind stories that stretch credulity remember reign of fire but i do expect them to be internally consistent this film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of lotr or even godzilla br br a shape shifting mystic warrior from korea curiously metamorphosed into a caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely boned up on ancient korean folklore because of the fed's excellent paranormal division which has gone unremarked up to this point lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims i never meant for this to happen a reincarnated pair of long dead koreans who died like star crossed lovers mystic pendants faceless hordes of robotic soldiers that owe a lot to peter jackson's orcs and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it br br the dialogue is appalling the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was to be honest tedious however for me the crowning moment was at the end after the finale when the music for the closing credits was arirang this is rather like akira kurosawa closing ran with a karaoke rendition of my way and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director shim to kurosawa br br in short a self indulgent lackluster collection of clichÃ©s and narrative non sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer or even a not so serious movie goer i would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video but i'm not even sure that it's worth that much

<START> lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers o j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit i'm not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to o j simpson and lamas' comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jean claude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o j simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldn't escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br out of 4 bad
<START> hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade the sub plot is original and the main plot is even better the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way br br claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933 well now kevin bacon has shocked us with hollow man one of the most thrilling horror films ever the action is intense and the chills are true you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue josh brolin kim dickens joey slotnick greg grunberg and mary randle all of whom do an exceptional job br br spoilers br br dr sebastian caine kevin bacon and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible after animal testings they move on to human testing but someone has to be the subject volenteering caine is turned invisible but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge end spoilers br br the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go the first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans think of deep blue sea then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man and then change the water into fire and explosions a rehashing of a killer shark movie interesting hollow man gets 5 5
<START> ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneider's line of thinking when he made semi successful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal since i've already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead colleen haskell from survivor and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry nothing memorably good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it there's a word for that milking actually here's another word cheap
<START> the first half of the film is ok the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time pulp fiction was robbed for best picture this is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is slow
<START> once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h beam piper who wrote a classic book named little fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet mr piper died in 1964 but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from br br skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of little fuzzy i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed br br but don't take my word for it here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of little fuzzy for free http www gutenberg org ebooks 18137
<START> this 1947 film stars and was directed and written by orson welles with a funky irish accent and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair so i've hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc but this was my first rita hayworth interaction our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened cagey elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer mike welles and elsa fall for each other he wants to run away with her she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun which borrowed heavily from this scene i wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end br br this movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon the dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect these might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from costco the flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare 7 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
<START> this would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham this guy is an awful actor be it comedy drama tear jerkers etc he stinks it seemed like at some point priyadarshan realized this too and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo scenes a bit funny br br he's the only noticeable drawback there are a couple more annoying tid bits of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise best comedy to come along in bollywood since hungama imo like hungama it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course akshay kumar this is probably his best performance to date he better be a shoe in for best comedian at every award function ak's always been good at comedy but he takes it to a different level here the body language the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line it's a genius performance the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i don't think i've ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usa br br garam masala doesn't have one lead heroine it stars 3 incredibly hot beautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job pretty sure they are all making their debuts paresh rawal is solid as usual although his routine wears itself out after a while rajpal yadav is his typical annoying self sick of his over the top act in every movie rimi sen has nothing to do br br overall definitely worth a dekho i'd say it's funnier than no entry and that's saying a lot could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abraham br br 8 10
<START> ok here it is nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama what we do is first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent and we let him flounder around between french german american and british for over 2 hours then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly but just to make sure the viewer doesnÂ´t fall asleep we throw in details which are shockingly absurd such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22 000 feet naturally we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles so we have every character even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed off city of lhasa in 1943 speak perfect english also with dubious accents of course the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story so what we do is this we have the dalai lama befriend the now reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors radios antique cars and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west in return our hero learns from his young protegÃ© a kind of vague undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader in other words we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist sort of in his own way even though we ourselves donÂ´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go and last but not least we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans which is certainly true thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie even though it is nothing of the sort so zat ist my idea vat do you zink can ve make zis movie
<START> this movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a nonstop action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
<START> after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock there's just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that he's finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his trainee replacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don't see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as 7even well maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt
