<START> in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great it was suspenseful and thrilling yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be

<START> the shirley jackson novel 'the haunting of hill house' is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiece br br the 1963 chiller 'the haunting' stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent br br and then jan de bont made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself br br it starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re telling and then the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face dr marrow's assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears br br from then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilson's character being particularly irritating so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue br br the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i won't bother listing them br br so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don't buy it whatever you do don't waste your money br br final rating 4 10

<START> the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very diligent and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire the judge to end their career and life the contractor or the contractor's go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions we are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city that is not typical of new york that is true in any mayoral office it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he derails his ambition to be the governor of new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly mushy with the ex deputy mayor campaigning in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not better than all the others just still too young in his ambition br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

<START> funny that i find myself forced to review this movie but here i am br br i am reviewing it because just recently i have had the chance to witness the revival of r c sheriff's play journey's end on stage in new york at the belasco theatre starring hugh darcy boyd gaines jefferson mays and others as well as being masterfully directed by david grindley br br i left the theater shattered i am not exaggerating i was flabbergasted after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier's life in the trenches of the somme i speculate during world war one brought to life vividly by everyone involved i came out of the theater with the shakes br br mind you i am not easily shocked nor am i too sensitive i am a stage actor and a director myself so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects both emotionally as well as psychologically br br but what i had just witnessed came so much to life that i had chills in my spine as i left br br none of these emotions came to life while watching aces high the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen in cooperation with r c sheriff himself shortly before he died br br the screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france so gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with br br the only plus of the movie are the aerial battle scenes which look dated in their special effects compared to today's standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen br br granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of all quiet on the western front by erich maria remarque which takes place in trenches and not in the sky but that was the german vision on things if one would like to be picky on such things br br journey's end is just the other side of the medal and would have made it into a great movie if they had left it alone and intact br br the transfer on dvd is poor even though in widescreen and adapted for 16 9 tv screens the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater nothing more nothing less it sports various defects such as minor scratches and dots although the copy for the rest is clean br br if you want another wwi movie in your collection especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old timers then this is a picture for you but i rather would suggest von richthofen and brown as an alternative although that too is a movie filled with inaccuracies br br for the rest of you who love good acting and drama i would leave this one out buy the play go watch the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you but keep off this would be adaptation br br it is an anti war movie granted but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime ever br br the presence of actors such as trevor howard ray milland richard johnson and john gielgud is just a bluff since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie br br mcdowell the very talented christopher plummer simon ward and peter firth all deliver very weak performances not due to their lack of skills but rather due to lack of true and solid direction br br there are too many gaps in it and as said before it drags itself to the dubious end dubious because in the original play none of the men we come to know and sympathize with stay alive they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission in the movie they all die except malcolm mcdowell who manages somehow to stay alive another day being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause br br the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness you just hear the cannons roar the machine guns rattle and grenade impacts throughout the theater then suddenly total peace and silence the curtain comes up lights and here they all are lined up standing straight and rigid obedient corpses br br far more interesting and far more shocking than aces high finale which is also dragged by the hair br br it is up to you to judge br br for me if i had the money and the contacts to do so i would take the play and develop it the way it was meant adding here and there some action scene in the field just to visualize the outer horror and slaughter going on in the vasty fields of france around the men involved but then just strictly concentrating on what is going on in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the world br br want such a movie br br then ask for it br br this is not it
<START> i felt compelled to write a review for space cobra as it has received a good score of 7 3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers this is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy space cobra himself is witty and likable i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly you barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience check out if you can
<START> most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good and bad sci fi movies in hollywood but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land the story is a basic femme fatale premise nothing new or enthralling verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences which instead of defining our main character and his situation are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot the screenplay was solid the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting jereone krabbe was amazing as the tortured artist and the supporters were very good as well also jan de bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director br br 6 5 10 br br 1 2
<START> little man now on dvd is a wayans brothers flop it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home he then goes through all sorts of home alone or child's play like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film the jokes have been done in other places so many times that they aren't cute or funny i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over in watching the deleted scenes minus cgi this actor was funny in a mini me like way but they chose a different route a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes spend your rental fee on borat if you want some real laughs these days br br http mcmusicnotes blogspot com
<START> ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp they are tortured we learn north korean communists are bad people we learn americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture br br i tried to suppress it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of brandy next acting stone cold sober he takes a drunken companion dewey martin to get sulfur to cure mr martin's hangover of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer which is next to a bunch of empty boxes i'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it otherwise it's wasteful br br prisoner of war 1954 andrew marton ronald reagan steve forrest dewey martin
