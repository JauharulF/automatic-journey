<START> a fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at doing something about them when the chance strikes nothing was easy for morris either he had a family job job opps elsewheres a mortgage etc it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play aaa ball for 4 months it took guts i am glad that they showed his indecision almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors br br i can remember seeing him pitch against the red sox i think it was a great story though morris actually looks more like john kruk or a mills watson than quaid that's okay br br quaid does a very good job playing the man the teacher coach and 'oldest rookie' as someone who is in the the same age group i certainly can id with his plight you're not quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid but it's getting there you have to do it sooner than lator br br believably told nicely edited paced acted good to see the familiar faces of the late royce applegate brian cox and rachel griffiths here br br good job all around glad to see it hit br br outta who woulda thought that the tampa devil rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on
<START> at one point violet lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because i'm bore phobic it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom br br have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you bet br br watching the detectives is a clichÃ© romantic comedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of set up we know that neil is pretty laid back guy who didn't really commit to anything and then violet enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say no br br as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely bullshit this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a nutjob after collaborating with many great directors recently danny boyle's sunshine and 28 days later ken loach's the wind that shakes the barley and neil jordan's breakfast on pluto to name a few it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop paul soter by all means he's not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet her acting is a mess i mean it's all over the place and so over the top tony montana would have been proud br br the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine br br bloodymonday rating 1 5 4
<START> the sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions as she had the power of magic she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself frequently resulting in literal puns that are often disastrous and always humorous br br the program began with sabrina's adventures in high school in the fictional town of westbridge located near boston massachusetts as opposed to greendale in the comics in the series' later seasons sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college then moved on to her attempts to live on her own and keep a job at the local newspaper breaking further from its comic roots the show ended with sabrina's wedding although in the end she abandoned the wedding and ran off with harvey br br many episodes involve sabrina getting to meet through natural or supernatural means popular real life musical artists of the time including coolio the violent femmes the backstreet boys phantom planet davy jones of the monkees britney spears avril lavigne daniel bedingfield hanson eden's crush savage garden 'n sync and ashanti course of nature the band of melissa joan hart's then boyfriend now husband mark wilkerson appeared in an episode in 2002
<START> i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matinÃ©e triple bill which also featured vincent price's last man on earth and mario bava's nightmare castle i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards though i didn't know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre no wonder i was so scared though all three films frightened me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact br br it was the first on the bill i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes the unedited runs 87minutes but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined castles fog enshrouded cemeteries shadows and cobwebs gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french italian import it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg i couldn't quite remember the title remember i didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka danze macabre coffin of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usa uk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it illusive but thanks to the internet and perseverance i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as the haunting the innocents or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer georges riviere who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest as is arturo dominici as dr carmus and margarete robsahm as julia br br many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere cobwebs creaking doors fog etc are bound to seem clichÃ© to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer br br the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes i originally missed this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the intro it may have been more of hindrance than a help the english voice dubs are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers br br however synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so br br i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's italian goth films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story br br rob rheubottom winnipeg mb canada
<START> well on it's credit side if it can be said to have one timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g wells' outstanding novella but other than that well to call a spade a spade it sucks bigtime what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged 20 million dollar budget timothy hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed genius anyway look like the best filmmaker of all time the special effects i guess you'd call them that are not even up to computer game standards the acting is well perhaps about dinner theater comparable and the accents are atrocious at the risk of sounding offensive a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially poor ogilvy well ahem gay poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor hey the stormtroopers in star wars had neat white body armor too and it didn't work either they still got blasted even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray' they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance even when they're theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen being left over from jason and the argonauts or was it josie and the pussycats i dunno the soldiers presumably because they're 'military' all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him wow i loved it but the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war or boer commandos which would be more or less correct for the period perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines oddly enough the character of the curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting oh yeah musn't forget the thunder child in the book the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo ram it was meant to ram enemy ships yet it's bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker toy constructed martian war machines with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak and she sank an ironclad warship like thunderchild could've rammed the titanic and survived but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest bidder constraints as our own military the costumes are all wrong especially the british army and police uniforms cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas and timbo in an obvious homage to western films of yore has obviously set his movie in wild western england because all his riders are using western saddles the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky on the credit side and contrary to what one reviewer wrote the only genuine authentic feature of this thing is the artillery the guns are not from the civil war but appear to my eye and research as bona fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders perfectly authentic to the period so was the ammunition shown being used but the artilleryman who is a driver in the horse artillery was not shown correctly driving his limber you don't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team you ride the nearside wheel horses the opening using what i believe is authentic period film footage is okay and the score's not bad however to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground and it certainly didn't in 1898 br br but growing up reading this novel i am very disappointed even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's zillion dollar special effects laden version maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise and vice versa i have a lot more to say but i'll let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds that's faithful to the original timmy's vision is fine for a high school film class or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college level film student and about as bad which is about the best i can say for this thing but that's about it oh yeah just where did the budget go and what happened to michael caine i'd like to hear his comments i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines' breathtaking bound breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk taking director's ticket to cult stardom because i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie which i didn't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me with no malicious intent that i've been able to determine i must add here that i thought blackmoon's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement but an absolute hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch i find it hard to watch master timbo's version after blackmoon keep it up tim make your own version of dune now it just awaits the hand of a master like you and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield forget it it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness hey get a life timbo is worse than the master ed wood i kid you not
<START> less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it br br the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesn't happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them br br the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under 20 and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't a little bit of talent br br the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid bitches that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl injures herself and is whining about it four of them aren't wearing seat belts what do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer and you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whatever br br the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to br br supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up oh gotta mention the soundtrack also if that's what it was it was horrid sad one second then hard rock the next br br at the end of the day five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes it doesn't help when the script is terrible the scares tension suspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous br br this was a horrible low budget movie avoid it at all costs br br 1 10
<START> br br get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick speakman's considerable kempo skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isn't half bad just executed pretty poorly but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts you're missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown way way too few korean actors even extras
<START> if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves sometimes they even admit it but that's not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones br br the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me later br br brian avenet bradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
<START> when the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the blockbuster but honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser the movie has a tag line preeti madhura tyaga amara which means love's sweet but sacrifice is immortal in the movie the hero of the movie ganesh sacrifices his love for the leading lady pooja gandhi even though the two loved each other his justification is the meaning of the tag line this movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this loser like sacrificial attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is when they could have moved on with their lives ganesh's acting in the movie is amateurish crass and childishly stupid he actually looks funny in a song onde ondu sari when he's supposed to look all stylish and cool his looks don't help the leading role either his hair style is badly done in most part of the movie pooja gandhi cant act her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent br br the good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by mano murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie also the lyrics by jayant kaikini are very well penned the director yograj bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner br br anyway all in all except for the songs the movie is a very ordinary one
<START> this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver's license it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars br br such things as dune buggies drag racing custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times none of the people in the film are actually heard instead everything is done in narration and voiceovers sorry but i can't stand that br br there is nothing educational or interesting about dad can i borrow the car it's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their wonderful world of disney tv show 1 10
<START> this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie the story is wrong and a complete lie there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry the marxist leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts br br never ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen mccarthy read ann coulter's book treason for a better look at the truth about sen mccarthy br br it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http www thenewamerican com tna 1996 vo12no18 vo12no18 mccarthy htm
<START> why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf i've been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf grendel starring gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess br br what bugged me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow br br and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn't knock him out he was much too reliant on weapons beo wimp is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem br br i'd like to end this on a positive note but i can't really think of one offhand all i can say is if you've ever read beowulf you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation
