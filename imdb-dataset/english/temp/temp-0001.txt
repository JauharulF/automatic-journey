<START> a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie
<START> i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh neither did how to lose friends and alienate people br br this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off however he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous but in the end he ends up doing them the culture of life br br the movie is well toned with humor romance good acting and also a bit of a lap dance its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends
<START> steve carell plays dan burns newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls at a large family homecoming dan meets his perfect woman only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother br br what's a man to do br br i rather liked dan in real life but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful if you cannot accept it fear not get smart will be along later in the year but for the record i thought he was very good br br dan in real life starts off like your typical incidentally amusing family drama but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and carell's frustration with his situation grows it's not massively original but if you only saw movies with original ideas cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed wouldn't they but dan in real life is entertaining and a good cast who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love br br i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again
<START> daddy's girls florence lawrence and dorothy west receive some terrific news at the local post office unaware they are being stalked by burglar charles inslee meanwhile father david miles receives a message from young robert harron which necessitates daddy leaving home so when the young women return they can beÂ home alone as the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening the local grand ball of the black and tans gets underway and a dark skinned drinker portends additional danger for d w griffith's dynamic duoÂ br br mr inslee has one of his better biograph roles stealing the film from the girls and daddy ironically director griffith appears as one of the black faced extras at the black and tans ball biograph girls lawrence and west are suggestive of later griffith girls lillian and dorothy gish especially in orphans of the storm 1921 and they are excessively affectionate in bed the racist tone is unfortunate since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing br br the girls and daddy 2 1 09 d w griffith florence lawrence dorothy west charles inslee
<START> if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3 d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey 8 of 10
<START> i've seen this film more than once now and there's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then this is part of petzold's game he plays along with the rules of genre br br it's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteo hummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction it's more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings it's a reverie sorts of so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelganger constellations br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesn't say much about the nature of gespenster at all
<START> second feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job happy to accept live in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy i end up feeling like a prisoner too but this rather classy b film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic it's far fetched and unlikely but not uninteresting and our heroine nina foch is quick on her feet rehashing this in 1986 as dead of winter proved not to be wise as the plot elements are not of the modern day julia ross is extremely compact too short at 65 minutes but it stays the course nicely until a too rushed climax which feels a little sloppy from
<START> any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish mcqueen had charisma never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said mcqueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as doc the film had excitement and suspense baldwin and company made this into a comedy i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors did the makeup people have it in for michael what were they thinking if you wish to see movie making the way it was under sam peckinpah's direction get the original
<START> this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies but you'd think that even the homeless and urban dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor ice t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before br br and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle br br i'm assuming this movie was based on richard connell's short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story i reedited the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being 43 minutes long
<START> the film cross eyed by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive settings costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next you can't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can't wait for his sophomore effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo
<START> i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy sooraj badjatya seems to have completely lost it after success of hum aapke hain kaun he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind br br there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say 'oh at least this thing is good' aloknath does clichÃ© in a role of girl's father shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying hard to act actors cacophonous background music cheap soundtracks br br now the spoiler i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note
