<START> tv version of twister springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable my sister bought this at a wal mart a few years back when it was released i saw it back then and thought it was okay later twister with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out or was it before i think it was '97 and did a better job overall but twister was more silly fun this is realistic with a message it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study br br john schneider and devon sawa he's the reason my sister bought it star and devon sawa who went on to wild america final destination and slackers got his big break here so in a way i was one of the first people to see him really take off i don't know if it's an honor or a shame i haven't seen how he acts in recent films br br night of the twisters all depends on personal taste like i said it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study night of the twister has the latter so you decide br br i give it a 2 5 5 br br john ulmer
<START> now i love bela lugosi don't get me wrong he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers this is just another one of those br br lugosi plays dr lorenz a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons he is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful it's revealed that she is 70 80 years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid 50's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained br br anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead then lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it's kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies maybe the neck and then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty we never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosi's wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie a weird old hag and her two deformed sons one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf little person to be politically correct in today's world at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosi's dreary downstairs lab who these 3 are and how they came to be lugosi's scared assistants is like a lot of stuff in this film never explained br br so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on them so she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid this expert turns out to be creepy dr lorenz she quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors i'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work br br it seems that lugosi's movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens i mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed d'oh br br and then later it's revealed that the young ladies don't even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker the devil bat same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly 'reporter gets bad guy' deal br br but lugosi is always good he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him the woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor she had no emotion whatsoever she just delivered her lines like a machine gun spewing them out as quickly as she could everyone else pretty much blew too when it came to being good actors br br but this thing is watchable if only for bela lugosi fans lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog he must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him br br and he was right we horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosi he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera we do give two f ks for you bela
<START> probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful dramatic episode in this case the superb balance of terror with a lighter affair shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci fi and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry the true triumph is trouble with tribbles in season 2 the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness br br diverting from the show's tradition the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode instead kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty a well deserved break after three months of incessant work the earth like planet a budget related fact is very appealing but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens dr mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work soon other people begin experiencing similar things a woman meets a don juan like character sulu has a run in with a samurai and kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy throw in a freakishly real looking tiger and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt br br the idea is a classic one idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest of course everything works out fine again come the end and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves most notably and ironically the otherwise hilarious william shatner and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new previously unseen things the definition of star trek's success br br 7 5 10
<START> the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed and in all probability never will and as in any story about any war beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving it is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective which is what director ang lee provides in ride with the devil ' a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the war itself and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war the infamous raid on lawrence kansas by quantrill and his raiders which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the confederate point of view br br in 1863 the union influence predominates in the state of kansas and even across the border in neighboring missouri those with confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching northerners especially without the aid of what could be considered any regular' confederate troops and when things begin to really heat up around their own town jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and jake roedel tobey maguire form a band of their own and join in the fray doing damage to the union cause wherever it is practicable jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing but they are standing up for what they believe to be right br br there are others however even among their own men like the young pitt mackeson jonathan rhys meyers who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims and so for jack bull and jake as well as many just like them it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood and they will have to ride with the very devil himself against seemingly insurmountable odds br br as with all of his films director ang lee approaches his story through an incisive yet subtle examination of the traditions cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting and in so doing lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers perhaps a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters eat drink man woman' the effects of class distinction sense and sensibility' the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies crouching tiger hidden dragon' or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above the ice storm' lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level this film is no exception and as he does with all his films lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography in this film by frederick elmes who also did the ice storm' brilliantly which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry it's that special lee touch and it adds a wistful reflective sense to whatever story he is telling which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable br br as jake tobey maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops and his character along with it most importantly maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere even in such troubled times the betrayal which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance and it is no small accomplishment it is however the kind of studied understated performance that is often taken for granted which is unfortunate work like this is worthy of acclaim and should be recognized br br skeet ulrich is effective as well as jack bull and jewel in her motion picture debut turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley it is jeffrey wright however who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt as well as jonathan rhys meyers who brings a chilling christopher walken like menace to his role of pitt also in what amounts to a cameo role one scene mark ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time br br the supporting cast includes james caviezel black john simon baker george clyde tom guiry riley tom wilkinson orton brown john ales quantrill john judd otto roedel and kathleen warfel mrs chiles the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation but hopefully as time goes on it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like ang lee and films like ride with the devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing in light of more recent events it is something that is sorely needed worldwide film is a powerful medium it can be educational as well as entertaining and perhaps in the future more filmmakers like ang lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> this film proves that the commercial cinema or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille's name there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot what else the screen is somewhat dim o'neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse br br rating 1 10
<START> once upon a time there were different types of movies these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer br br this seems obvious at first but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans that's all it is it doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture literally after all hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people bodyguard or the preacher's wife w whitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mind br br first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti there are worse things in this world and worse movies the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun the movie starts with schubert's ave maria and then leoncavallo's matinatta pav sings arias from la gioconda manon lescaut and turandot but also sings popular music such as i left my heart in san francisco and the song that was nominated for an oscar golden globe if we were in love w music by john williams lyrics by alan marilyn bergman all 3 previous oscar winners br br the story isn't that bad it was built for pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago when asked to sing again at the same place the met in nyc he loses his voice from fear doctor pamela or pah may lah in italian played by kathryn harrold gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts br br they embark on an affair she knowing he's married promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman despite all that they fall in love thus the song if we were in love and with her help he overcomes his fear goes back to the met where he triumphs i won't tell how it ends but it's fairly predictable which isn't always a bad thing br br the performances in this aren't that bad pavarotti who plays giorgio fini isn't an actor so if you're expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance you are deluded not pavarotti he knows he's not a thespian what he is is cute charming charismatic he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too it's not so bad one funny line is when he tells pamela harrold that she's a thirsty plant fini can water you and of course she says i don't want to be watered on by fini kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little one of my favorite lines in the movie is life never has to be life size and there's eddie albert who does his usual good job as fini's manager there are several themselves cameos by real conductors singers etc and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center br br if you like opera if you like pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go enjoy a little fling just like he proposes in the movie then you can enjoy this movie for what it is i know i do every time br br

<START> evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it
<START> the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleisher's favorite enemies arabs and germans to make us believe that very arab looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both trades are were run by locals and involve d much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer it's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish director br br the acting is above average especially by peter ustinov suleiman and kabir bedi malik michael caine dr linderby is good as always
