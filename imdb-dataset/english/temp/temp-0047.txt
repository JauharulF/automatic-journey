<START> it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes old school and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family he was only 22 years old then and this is a must see br br 8 10
<START> takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did br br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either the dark underlying morals are there but it's also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice br br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuring br br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china ' br br good job takashi miike 8 10 stars
<START> at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so excessively feminist but i was wrong as you maybe have read in earlier published comments i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother i never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman it's like guzman is presented as somebody with a spine this in contrast to her classmates so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised br br in addition i'd like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character i can't really explain why but especially in the love scenes she convinced me it just looked real i think br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because of the dull last half hour
<START> uc 0079 the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meet in battle al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission br br for only 6 episodes gundam 0080 is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked 0083 then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than action br br mobile suit gundam 0080 war in the pocket br br sometimes you have to lose to win
<START> i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn't pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women's ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they're expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap
<START> there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer suffer they do in this dreary truly dreadful film but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non dental variety too if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids barfing kids sick kids lots of long long meaningful glances a deadpan wife and a concerned husband it's all here for you boring overlong it stands out as one of those examples that scream out why is there a saving grace yes there is there is a short scene from nabucco with some pretty good singing save your money or if it's on tv or cable save your time you can always read a book or make an omelette
<START> i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
<START> just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action br br but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it rating 3 10 br br derboiler
<START> a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlin's award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able bodied br br this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks' and that was because i preferred nigel hawthorne's performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill br br my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working class dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet br br life in working class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and day lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard br br the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart warming triumph over adversity movie that it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting in the course of his career day lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100 convincing as christie his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day lewis is able bodied the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole from hugh o'conor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christy's mother which won her the best supporting actress award br br the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait he was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day lewis's acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of christy's character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 8 10
<START> i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself still he mugs well and carries things along the death knell is twofold first of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that robertson's character sitting up in bed in the blue light looking confused that might add another chunk i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that when all is said and done leaves incredible questions i'm not putting in spoilers but when it ends don't think too much i can come up with ten what ifs without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story
<START> ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy br br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200 nothing was firmly established br br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
<START> honestly who in god's name gave this movie an 8 1 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film i'm a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen the props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else i'm all for bad language in movies but the f bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f bomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn't belong on a dvd br br do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but it's not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
