<START> office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps ' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers' and office space ' and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it's predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc'l'isco ' it's an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn't all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp ' it's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm ' the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he's nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he's typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do' in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important' letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth's days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh ' but they didn't and the audience won't because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays' funny as in he knows' he's being funny he never is and that's exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny ' he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad' is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance if only momentarily but it's still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel ' however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it's destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as obscurity ' i rate this one 1 10 br br br br

<START> i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime time every year in the 60's it's a typical hollywood history epic dramatized stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film cecil b demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film his son in law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky cinematographer loyalk griggs assistant director francisco day 2nd unit director arthur rosson art directors walter tyler and hal pereira set directors sam comer and ray moyer costume designers edith head john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson also in the cast are charles boyer e g marshall lorne greene claire bloom and inger stevens at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes i would give it a 7 5 out of 10

<START> murder in mesopotamia i have always considered one of the better poirot books as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot the comedic highlight of the episode being poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hastings the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances but are careful not to overshadow the two leads a danger in some christie adaptations some of the episode was quite creepy a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pigs an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one what made it creepy in particular putting aside the music was when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window about the adaptation it was fairly faithful to the book but i will say that there were three things i didn't like the main problem was the pacing it is rather slow and there are some scenes where very little happens i didn't like the fact also that they made joseph mercado a murderer in the book i see him as a rather nervous character but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer and under developing that made him a less appealing character though i am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer's next victim the other thing that wasn't so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran like it was in the book amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation on the whole despite some misjudgements on the writers' behalf i liked murder in mesopotamia 7 10 bethany cox
<START> making a book into a movie by following the story page by page is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybody's mind's eye opus is different which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a ticked off segment of the movie going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up br br all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see br br there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying carrie 'salem's lot the dead zone or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd awful mess kubrick's version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers br br although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation pet sematary has so many moments of just skin and bone deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings for that we have music video turned film director mary lambert to thank she also directed siesta not exactly a horror movie but another freaky as hell must see you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the 'man ster' himself and probably one of his better ones br br since the majority of you know the story i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details dr louis creed dale midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math it is a king story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br it's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream inducing life here rachel creed's star trek's denise crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow brad greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery and that third act if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse br br good performances by all here especially the late fred gwynne as the well intentioned neighbor jud crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up sometimes dead is better br br about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son gage miko hughes knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately hughes at the time was just too damn cute to sell his intended role as an evil demon possessed zombie this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged especially gwynne's death scene br br other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned but sematary is right up there in the top five br br still will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story not bloody likely for now
<START> i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5 4 rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn't wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyes's death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i don't get the rating honestly i don't sure this film isn't perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun 7 5 10 bethany cox
