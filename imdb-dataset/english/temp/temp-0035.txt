<START> gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish every single episode is a joy to watch the story is typical gundam fare in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government known as the earth sphere alliance is violently taking over the free colonies to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz which later takes control of earth and the colonies select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come these mechs known as gundams fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front stage completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies br br gundam wing as i previously stated is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle now don't get me wrong this show still has many epic battles within it and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1 br br no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime or sci fi in general the show sports some amazing animation and superb action but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed br br a perfect 10 10
<START> cary grant douglas fairbanks jr and victor mclaglen are three soldiers in 19th century india who with the help of a water boy sam jaffe rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult the chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time sam jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem a must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie
<START> this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot better br br the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together br br the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film 12 years after br br this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s
<START> it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didn't i read somewhere either don't care for opera don't care for wagner or don't care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagner's swan song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the text br br it's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagner's text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i can't think why syberberg couldn't splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music br br the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film
<START> having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city jim blandings cary grant finds a property in the country for his wife and children he's hoping to find the simple life but building a house proves to be anything but simple as the headaches and the bills start piling up so do the laughs will mr blanding's ever get his dream house br br what makes this movie so special is the three main actors grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own so when you combine their talents almost every scene is special grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role he is so good at playing the put upon husband loy is a always a joy to watch the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years douglas also appeared in the old dark house a particular favorite of mine br br the movie is definitely a product of its time i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two story three bedroom four bathroom house on 15 000 income a year throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid and it becomes almost fanciful br br however for anyone who has bought or built a house many of the situations and predicaments the blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today and that's where the comedy comes in how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected the biggest complaint i have about mr blandings is the whole wife in love with best friend subplot it's really not necessary to the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented
<START> such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer Â when it's in the right hands that is Â a bug's life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions br br it is only pixar's second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film br br after all it's a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter br br not only are they all entirely amiable and likable Â there isn't an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters Â but they're colourful they're eclectic and they're idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug's life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics br br the problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands however it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers br br if you think about it a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of akira kurosawa's classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies Â one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bug's life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl br br much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively br br as i've said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film Â the clichÃ©d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like however it's easy to ignore this fault and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film br br although a bug's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they're not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it's only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug's life other than see it it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year Â and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998 br br 8 5 10
<START> i have been a fervent hal hartley supporter since i saw his short surviving desire in high school and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant henry fool but this 10 year later sequel is not only unnecessary it's disgraceful br br after a choppy and expeditious start fay grim devolves into pseudo intellectualism flat out boredom and finally unwarranted and unwanted nihilism and that's just the plot br br the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the movie one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself and it's his only spoken scene in the film br br jeff goldblum's agent fulbright it seems is the only bright character a pun surely intended by hartley as well how then is he left spoiler dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentle natured hartley's most violent film to date and tonally all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go br br as for the other new characters angus james ned fool or is it grim not to mention fay herself well i won't spoil their fates as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own when it isn't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle which gives the disconcerting impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film student br br this piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isn't even good humored enough to revel in its messiness instead it self indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say in doing so hartley tracks sh t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them br br i have rarely been so depressed at the movies and i'm counting leaving las vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved br br grim indeed
<START> well i'll start by admitting i'm not a john ford fan i watched the informer only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the greats so if you are just move along 'cause you're not going to agree with me br br what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution but as usual ford is determined to bury it under over acting and cheap sentiment i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less than seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the talkies the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue of course title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times what dialogue there is usually has a they're always after me lucky charms quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent of course as bad as they are the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over it feels as if with an eagle eye you might see some villagers off to torch dr frankenstein in the background br br techniques change tastes change so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day but it's not one of the classics that hold up more just fair warning about the kind of over simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career

<START> this film moved me beyond comprehension it is and will remain my favourite film of all time mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film i have to put it into my dvd player so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says but your own words ask for direct confrontation isn't that a direct call for violence biko replies well you and i are in confrontation now but i see no violence br br craig robertson fife scotland
<START> the main problem with power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever it gets boring after awhile sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward you could probably pass it all off as character development but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie or are just simply to flat and uninteresting lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom he should have cut a few of the characters hackman the wife and concentrated harder on others billings it could have been a great hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting a fact that amazed me considering the cast even gene hackman performance wasn't up to par denzel washington is the only real actor of note here gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere br br sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies i e serpico and stop trying to recapture his success with 12 angry men and fail safe it hasn't worked yet sidney and it most likely never will leave the ensemble dramas to altman br br 3 10 br br
