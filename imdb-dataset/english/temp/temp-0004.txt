<START> if you r in mood for fun and want to just relax and enjoy bade miyan chote miyan is one of the movies to watch amitabh started off pretty good but it is govinda who steals the show from his hands awesome timing for and good dialog delivery its inspired from bad boys but it has indian masala to it people think it might be confusing and stupid but the fact that david dhavan is directing and govinda is acting should not raise any questions other recommended movies in the same genre david dhavan govinda combo are shola aur shabnam aankhen raja babu saajan chale sasural deewana mastana collie no 1 jodi no 1 hero no 1 haseena manjayegi ek aur ek gyarah
<START> when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the 4 for 20 dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks let's put in something else i'll admit a few of the lines from the friends at the cafÃ© made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over or under doing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film br br anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie it's the most pointless thing i've ever had the displeasure of watching do not watch or buy this movie

<START> the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations the evil dead 1982 style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him he succeeds not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative two days later ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn erica hoag her boyfriend nick craig bonacorsi four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show's up with his axe starts to slaughter the friends one by one br br edited written executive produced directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me i'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes it has every bad slasher clichÃ© the character's are awful the dialogue is terrible it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable flawed than usual the killer lumberjack dude is just lame then there's the final 10 minutes or so which if you make it that far believe it's tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen nick dawn everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain then proceed to pick holes in it laugh at it from saying why did they stand around argue why didn't they pick the axe up such things i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap to have it shoved down my throat made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap could see all the holes in it went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up kills everyone within two minutes why didn't he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of time br br director portugal turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight then there's the fact ranger vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the morning' indicating it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows it's pitch black outside when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isn't much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable it's not scary there's no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious br br technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant everyone involved should get an oscar nah only joking not really they were utterly awful even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking br br the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam it has awful effects is boring has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i've got it totally wrong it's the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done
<START> i like david hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood sometimes erotic though never pornographic someone else liked them too because my david hamilton books were stolen in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy obviously nude intimate with a young woman older than he also nude though discrete there was strong sexual connotation new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set br br the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography soft focus becomes out of focus and discrete angles become confusing perhaps because in motion they cannot be considered you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe to comprehend the movie is supposed to be a farce and funny things do happen but it doesn't hang together perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on eventually the 14 year old julien has intercourse with his cousin but it's soft core with no genital contact shown on camera since it's a farce we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and having caught them julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience in fairness the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along br br it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation guys will think lucky julien even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a bad thing all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age women too may have similar thoughts but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind hysterically the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided too bad since sexual awakening is a real human experience afer all children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does it's a fit literary subject cinema included but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children david hamilton i think was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic and unfortunately we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label
<START> i'm going to write about this movie and about irreversible the in famous scene in it so you are warned if you haven't seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended br br acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldn't period then we also have the bartender 2nd rape dude actually i don't think you would need him at least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on br br let's reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasn't intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them rosario's character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her br br rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here's another problem after the first rape takes place rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party it's obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone br br the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer after rape no 1 we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene it's apparent that he isn't a nice guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character isn't the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist 1 who cheats on a test gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clichÃ© to stay with you so rapist 1 submits to rosarios character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink br br so rapist 1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously that's just crazy but what comes next is even crazier first she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isn't about what this guy deserves or not it's just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist 1 if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up br br this isn't supposed to be entertaining enjoyable it's a hard watch it is art house but the 10 minute i didn't count rape scene at the end just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment br br irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the art house movie should've come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn't actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off br br good intentions talia and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn't work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are

<START> late one night on a desolate road in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers who've killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy's girl br br writer director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy but i'm glad he did it no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again br br i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties though guilty of some bad acting this is earnest enough and unpretentious making it hard for me to dislike br br the whole production is a bit odd though but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable
<START> lovely piece of good cinema this is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why well one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today and he is able to film emotions br br when you are watching the film you can feel what mr straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his marvellous john deere what changed in his mind what changed in your mind when you watched this film br br a beautiful fraternal love story
<START> had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix i'd have a couple of hours of my life back i'm frankly suspicious when i see that a film's director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were a few interesting moments e g judy tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy ism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i'd seen the whole thing nope though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless i found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended
<START> following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to cheÂstruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties the change of setting isn't just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle yet as che would go on to say himselfÂsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thatÂa struggle while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that part two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner br br while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible this somewhat distant cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manÂif anything the entirety of che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who Âarguably conducted the whole thing br br yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points here the basic structure of part one is echoed backÂthere's the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming and disquieting note this difference in combination with the similarities to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve br br indeed everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesÂthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged in fact upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review as a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively br br with that said i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that with a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
