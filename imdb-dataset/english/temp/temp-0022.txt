<START> i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched it this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format br br holy guacamole how i wish those days would come again i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car honda civic 1984 but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it also in my civic sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the van' br br 'the van' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately br br i highly anticipate that sam grossman the director has achieved his opus br br ratings john 1 2 sam
<START> a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong Â but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in she is hard nosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flip flops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a staple of film culture it is dated dull and formulaically chaotic br br director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within anna about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia both politically and socially but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is kirkland you remember if it isn't obvious this film didn't sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were non existent there was no enlightening pre story and there was no definition of time or place there was sally kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet anna's boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character Â only to boost the attention onto kirkland's anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads Â and sally kirkland arg it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna daniel and krystina but instead we are forced into a one sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot br br is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beauty less role in monster or halle berry in monster's ball was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by kirkland's portrayal of anna and bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesn't work hard for her parts doesn't care for others and is generally mean spirited Â yet we are to feel sympathy for her near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesn't get her way sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one that is where anna could have improved if this was a mature kirkland i would have gobbled it up but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd make out characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and outraged this didn't make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer the outrageous over the top wardrobe and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened Â anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema it was a show piece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time in this one it worked but i don't think i will be fooled again br br overall i cannot say that i was impressed with this film anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about sally kirkland and only sally kirkland bogayevicz tries to do more with the story but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story there are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or dedicate a sunday afternoon with Â he created an annoyance kirkland wasn't anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides perhaps i missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved that wasn't the case here in anna kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene i couldn't help but think that was what kirkland was like to those on the set she didn't make this into a film she transformed it into her own production and because of it anna failed i cannot suggest this to anyone Â from one czech to another Â skip it br br grade Â½ out of for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out

<START> this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt jane eyre to the screen and how much can go wrong in doing so it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence but even if the editing were better the film would not be the script is bad the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte brontÃ«'s novel at all the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out this is the case with all the short adaptations but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone the spirit the atmosphere and the concept of the novel br br this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with jane's arrival at lowood while this is perfectly all right since some scenes must by necessity be left out it is not understandable that instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying jane's friendship with helen the influence helen has for jane's development the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill treatment of helen which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death and this is about all which happens at lowood if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane's life and this is the problem throughout this adaptation it rushes from scene to scene very often without transition and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel the dialogues are an odd mixture of made up lines and lines from the novel very clumsily patched together and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel but the scriptwriter not only did brontÃ«'s language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set up with just one sentence when rochester and jane go to see rochester's wife after the would be wedding rochester says yet i once loved her his wife as i love you now the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved and that his effort to seek a true life partner is if not sanctified by god's and man's law yet understandable and forgivable but this one sentence completely undermines brontÃ«'s whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer br br from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely blonde blue eyed and full mouthed susannah york as the novel's plain heroine in addition ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it played by her the novel's shy reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised graceful and mature woman completely sure of herself and her deserts i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not brontÃ«'s jane eyre to cast george c scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70 br br to compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding the emotional climax of the novel has become a calm rational conversation between two middle aged persons at the end of which rochester falls asleep when jane returns to him in the last scene he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people's home by his favourite granddaughter the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st john of all people ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for jane's love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st john on the rochester of the novel but good though bannen is his st john is just as far from the novel as york's jane and scott's rochester the only redeeming features of this very disappointing jane eyre are the locations and the score and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of jane eyre
<START> i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be it didn't fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn't recognise one person this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent can't wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci fi stuff produced in the last decade
<START> i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn br br accordingly i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it br br i should have known better br br this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the don't sing a longs to the characterization br br while i remember the character's telling a story through a song this film's soundtrack was laid over the top and didn't seem to fit jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom there's old barn dance type country music it's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit br br even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderella's hoop skirt which doesn't feel right br br the movie itself could have been it's own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldn't say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original
<START> it was jon pertwee who said it s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly well if that s the case pasty faces is very easy david baker as director screenwriter and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior britcoms like lock stock and trainspotting using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly alan mccaffrey especially suffers from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because there s not enough of a film to ruin br br pasty faces is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise i couldn t understand why it ended the way it did it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation that you still get paid to donate blood in america people who i know in america and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter so we ve got a very erroneous view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots perhaps but this doesn t stop pasty faces from being a crap comedy
<START> superman and the mole men is quite possibly superman's toughest adventures ever br br lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby home of the world's deepest oil well while there some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men can superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring br br in my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent well written and well acted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for anyone br br 10 10 stars
<START> a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize 99 of the scifi channel's movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platt's bad writing and directing br br another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there this movie doesn't it's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platt's vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle br br this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn't afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that br br if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because she's ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing q back in st tng so that's nothing new br br in all i gave this movie a 4 10 rating
