<START> l'hypothÃ¨se du tableau volÃ© the hypothesis of the stolen painting 1979 begins in the courtyard of an old three story parisian apartment building inside we meet the collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure impressionist era painter tonnerre a narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with the collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us he's going to show us something br br as he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds the collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings and so on and so on every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different br br i watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about if i have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation an indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which the collector poses some sexless plastic figurines in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life size versions of the figures if we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plastic br br whether i've come to any definite conclusions about l'hypothÃ¨se du tableau volÃ© or not i can say definitely that outside of the early and contemporaneous works of peter greenaway like a walk through h i've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so dense and at heart so mischievous and fun
<START> what the f was this i just watched steven stop please this movie is insatiably bad and silly in a bizarre departure from action and adventure mr seagal is now fighting obviously wish they were vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength ok oh and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way wow even still in this movie however to quell seagals have to have the last punch and no one can kick my a ego he is somehow stronger than they are however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him come on i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer but these are super human strength people oh and get this seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is wolverine oh my go and worst than all of that yes there is a worse than that he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film it was pure madness although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven awful awful awful two thumbs down redemeption qualities well i guess so i will be fair in that aspect at least some of the special effects were ok and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses the women all were quite attractive imo still and i said still it does not make up for the blatant x men underworld insert your favorite zombie vampire movie here rip off the director writer producer all should be bansihed exile from the movie business i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood rayne and just about all other uwe boll pictures about this film that's my whole 1 00 on this film view if you dare
<START> disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight to video back in early 2003 dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall 2003's dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done it's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkey zero stars
<START> greetings again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 9 11 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co stars as sandler's former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 9 11 br br of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writer director mike binder the upside of anger and sandler's accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes don't work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directed br br sandler and cheadle are both excellent sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle br br support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith as cheadle's wife liv tyler as a very patient psychiatrist saffron burrows in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler's in laws br br the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde bruce springsteen and roger daltrey as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story
<START> i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood the acting and story is simply pathetic the direction is awful i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap i bet the movie was made in less than a day i don't know what category it falls into please avoid this movie at all costs just do anything even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie
<START> the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed it's that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song there's an african japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you'll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
<START> citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo the ripper of rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no one untouched in the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds i can only say that next to the silence of the lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i've ever seen br br it is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation donald sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as rea's and what to say about jeffrey dumann playing the serial killer dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co workers he is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious br br i can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well made docu drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects it deserves at least a 9 10 perhaps even more if you ask me
<START> seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released br br gore vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the novel's story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen br br studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast sensing disaster became increasingly combative in her dvd commentary star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls br br the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the basics of vidal's story are there but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing connects and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental br br chief among these accidents is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film br br the remaining cast is largely wasted raquel welch a significantly underestimated actress plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim backus william hopper and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed yes it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one br br the how and why of that is made clear in sarne's audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he emphatically did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed at one point he flatly states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda' which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take off on it br br although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in tandem with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project br br in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians movie buffs and cult movie fans i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone but everyone else should pass it by br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> it's hard to believe after waiting 14 years we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels br br the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell or is it sharon stone possibly a copulation of both br br if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in b s 1 forget it you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them it's interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies via the 1966 georgy girl when ms stone was only 8 years old a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here br br if you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system if not you might as well wait for the dvd release in the rated version unrated version collectors edition or ultimate version and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of basic instinct 3 at which point ms stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care
<START> where do i start per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity in the end i was severally let down this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene rather it is a hollywood or pick your film making hub story loosely based on some real life characters i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german the blood red text title artists should have been the 2nd clue the story line is contrived lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann's parents there is no info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt was there on leave etc etc the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions these went away from daily use once the war started etc the characters are stereo types sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power don't waste your time
<START> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release although sound came into general use in 1928 there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
<START> being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the direct to video movies as i have mixed feelings of them as well br br while watching the lion king 1Â½ i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latter br br the lion king 1Â½ definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos br br i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i don't think many kids are really concerned about disney's profit margin on direct to video movies br br however i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie i'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me br br as for the music it wasn't too bad but don't expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of fun br br so all in all the lion king 1Â½ isn't a perfect movie but it's cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends' perspectives br br my imdb rating 7 10 my yahoo grade b good
