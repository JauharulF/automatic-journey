<START> the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jean marc vallÃ©e who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare br br taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life vallÃ©e instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal vallÃ©e takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching br br a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over encumbering it indeed while watching vallÃ©e's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well br br yet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereÂand indeed to most period dramasÂare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outings br br in the end it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable vallÃ©e never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a run of the mill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middle ground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of there's something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5 day rental because i couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time br br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's missteps the checker at the save mart was great but the script writing is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need br br don't get me wrong slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there's something about mary one more time
<START> i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson but wasn't i said where's bill paxson then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director's alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased one guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up campers were successes in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one
<START> this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so br br there is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie the female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie i suppose it is 'funny' that luke's even uglier dorkier stupider friend is around but well that is what we get br br neither of the female leads would ever ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in friday the 13th 4 dead
<START> this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd the film footage doesn't look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b w silent film set in iran in 1925 the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river men women children animals then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot it is sink or swim and climb or die in search of grass for their animals they have cows goats dogs horses mules in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy they had such a hard life i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this makes you appreciate modern life in usa
<START> loosely based on the james j corbett biography the roar of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s br br the story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world john l sullivan beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and it's all the spin off vignettes in corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support corbett's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous yet as brash and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and it's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim br br the film never sags for one moment and it's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you alexis smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goes it will do for me to be sure to be sure 9 10 for a truly wonderful picture
<START> simply great movie no doubt about it great story and superb performances be it amitabh akshay shefali priyanka boman or rajpal hindi film industry is going shameless with mallika and co this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our indian society but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb anu malik boring copy cat could have been avoided and ismail darbar or himmesh reshmmiya could have been used as musician i think vipul shah should have given little bit gujarati touch particularly in music also anu malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required he looks only good with govinda style songs i felt some nice serious music with couple of good ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable
<START> this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn't find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer's role or at least in francen's which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget
<START> its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do br br biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
<START> i just don't see how a concorde new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just boggles the mind doesn't it br br well let's make no mistake about it munchie strikes back is indeed a bad film munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the mom's problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of 20 000 ouch she can't come up with the money because she just got fired ok just is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think br br munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was borrowing it from the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange hmm br br anyway i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie anne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer munchie strikes back 's credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe munchie hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force heh 1 10
<START> spoilers br br i wasn't sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it br br i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars but i do recommend the movie even for a sequel br br 8 10 br br quality 9 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 7 10
