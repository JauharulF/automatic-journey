<START> all day now i've been watching dinosaurs and all day they've had the same fundamental problem br br they don't believe in firearms they just don't seem to have been told about them or something bullets bounce off of dinosaurs maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder and the laws of physics were just different back then aah no come on if they're close enough to chemically operate today they'd have to be vulnerable to fast even subsonic lead projectiles it's that simple br br look the toughest skinned reptiles on the planet today alligators and crocodiles are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire they're nothing magic you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs they don't take armor piercing bullets or anything special small bullets penetrate them they just don't kill them somewhat but not really large bullets are preferred because the challenge as with most game is to kill the animal with one shot so it doesn't run hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested br br most animals including predators are easily repelled by gunfire between the noise and the pain of even a non lethal wound most will run away an exception are big bears which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded we've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions a big cat will run if it can but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation where a t rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown their behavior simply has not been observed with these larger animals safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile and or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge with a t rex of course this could be a serious problem i've seen a t rex skull they have one in the museum downtown and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach small bullets would still penetrate them they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill br br so here we have cortez and his men this is before the famous mexican campaign apparently captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t rexes that terrorized the continent in the day rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt kill them ok maybe they don't have m 16s like the guys in the carnosaur series but they do have flintlocks crossbows pointed sticks big ones made from trees and swords maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto but they've several guys and i'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur oh wait there's a cannon about a 4 incher that's just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus' skull so they lay a trap with a squad of men cannon pointed sticks in a ravine and lure the first t rex into it using a pretty brown girl as bait cortez points out that they'll not have time to reload so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim t rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire and we see both a crossbow bolt and the cannon ball bounce off forget it end of credibility a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez' torso armor and a 4 cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship this would also certainly get through the hide ribcage or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet do you think a whale could withstand a 4 cannon ball and here's t rex still standing not even bleeding so cortez lures it to the ravine where it falls onto the pointed sticks which i guess by magic penetrate it and kill it yaaay pointed sticks br br the dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol this runs it off so it's not as mean as a bear or a buffalo at least in the movies br br they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones my money would still be on the cannon it's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction toward the target a bomb is a much more diffused application of force a real bomb not a gourd bomb has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure think pipe bomb vs firecracker a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof trust me on that one
<START> the garden of allah is a prime example of popular women's literature turn of the xxth century style combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado masochistic bite of catholic guilt just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins or the heroine of rebecca couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife and her castle burned down around her or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs domini the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards oh well it could have been much worse and it often was br br without the religious overtones the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery all passion spent leaving her to clean up his mess and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's thais a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name thankfully br br but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism of course is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering vibrant life imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all a truckload of worthy character actors including one cute dog a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the composed film that michael powell who ironically had a bit part in the 1927 silent version always dreamed about tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic operatic exoticism a dream like atmosphere where material considerations are no object characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next dialog is sparse vague and suggestive the art direction is close to celestial flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats saints doomed but horny sinners mystics or poets br br ahh hollywood the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable the bit rate is very high throughout the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2 0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession br br a historical note on this sort of women's subject the following year 1937 julien duvivier visibly inspired by the garden of allah directed carnet de bal where a very similar clothes horse butter won't melt in her mouth heroine widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book she finds them all in time only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later
<START> i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john gielguld vittorio de sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce but maybe in 1968 people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine br br meanwhile the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china br br our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice br br so when the pope gets crowned in rome he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust br br apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie i'd give it three oscars for stupidity br br by the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope he is much more plausible as zorba the greek
<START> this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it
<START> i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the point br br timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the 25 clichÃ© expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned crusader for justice journalist it simply will not fly br br however timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and i'm surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake br br there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air br br but enough of timberlake bashing words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very run of the mill corruption story it's plot ranges from clichÃ© to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown don't get me wrong edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through it br br the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode it's your typical far too glib for reality let's impress the audience with how well we articulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slow motion br br thinking about it edison is a curiosity it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
<START> this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching br br i don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture br br dean morgan rochester ny
<START> wow alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run unearthed films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go i've seen it all almost every horror film known to man argento fulci bava buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place this review is for the devils experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the devils experiment not only delivers but that's all it is pure unadulterated violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released br br i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place the devils experiment is not for everybody it's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life
<START> frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldn't be laughing you've already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide open mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the point br br but for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for him br br it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein's film but for some insane reason i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer if someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the pain perhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can't even begin to attempt to explain br br unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a doggie bag
<START> the human tornado is a campy 70's blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian rudy ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date the movie tells the tale of dolemite a bad ass pimpin' hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife dolemite barely escapes and journeys to sunny california to visit an old friend a nightclub owner and madam to dolemite's 'ladies' named queen bee however it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket so dolemite takes matters into his own hands rudy ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film including strong dramatic skills a mastery of kung fu an impressive singing voice he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack a touching compassionate side with the ladies and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing this film has it all people a deep plot blistering action laugh a minute comedy beautiful women in distress a slam bang ending what more could you ask from a movie run don't walk to your local video store and rent the human tornado today and be sure to share it with your family
<START> hotel du nord is the only carnÃ© movie from the 1936 1946 era which has dialogs not written by jacques prÃ©vert but by henri jeanson janson was much more interested in the jouvet arletty couple than in the pair of lovers annabella aumont the latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf's song les amants d'un jour except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one what's fascinating today is this popular little world the canal saint martin settings br br this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason the pimp jouvet tells his protÃ©gÃ©e raymonde he wants a change of air atmosphÃ¨re because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphÃ¨re the whore raymonde wonderful arletty thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole french cinÃ©ma br br in french atmosphÃ¨re atmosphÃ¨re est ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphÃ¨re translation attempt atmosphere atmosphere have i got an atmosphere face this is our french nobody's perfect
<START> this was a truly bad film the character cole played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil it didn't after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance this would have added some sincerity br br 1 badly acted 2 unsympathetic characters 3 razor thin plot line br br yuck br br
<START> i'm fan of art i like anything about art i like paintings sculptures etc this movie shows it so i like it a lot it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art especially naked bodies but she can't do it because of her strict family father at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked but she wanted a man for her paintings but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked she falls in love with her art teacher and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying he said that he raped her but it wasn't true artemisia fell in love with him but if she says that she will suffer a lot because in the trial in which artemisia her father and the art teacher were somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth i think this a great movie about art and an artistic love it's worth watching valentina cervi is great as artemisia she acts very well i also like her performance in the portrait of a lady as pansy osmond 8 5 10
