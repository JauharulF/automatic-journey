<START> i just saw this episode this evening on a recently added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekday br br as the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonetheless br br my father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago br br minor spoiler br br this particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period br br viewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4 5 decades ago and still provide some food for thought as did this episode br br while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20 some minutes of entertainment and interest
<START> personally i find the movie to be quite a good watch it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized br br not only that it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads br br overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens br br i'd recommend this movie to any triad mafia movie fan another good watch would be dragon squad that movie has more guns than this as in this movie there's more knives than guns in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun
<START> necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic moby dick john barrymore is captain ahab who falls in love with the pastor's daughter joan bennett his brother derek is a rival for ms bennett's affections when mr barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident bennett rejects him he must slay the whale and win bennett back br br there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg the film hasn't aged well however there are much better films from the time both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies the two name attractions john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best br br moby dick 8 14 30 lloyd bacon john barrymore joan bennett lloyd hughes
<START> i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind movies by will hay and abbot costello especially as those are my favourites i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will hay's oh mr porter which is one of the finest comedies ever made i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago the movie finished at 12 45am i find that movies of this kind to do with ghost trains etc are best viewed at night time with the lights out that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie br br the one liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers i guess this depends on the viewer they are not dated to me though i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released my dad was though i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind sitting in the room in front of the tv with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this it is an escape from reality for a while br br i noticed that one of the men in the movie he has a black mustache he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station this man was in the will hay classic the ghost of st michaels as well just thought i'd point that out in case no one noticed br br the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes br br we need more of this type of movie in todays market but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour this sort of movie making era the ghost train oh mr porter etc to me is the golden age of cinema
<START> i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide i definitely liked it this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen my first impression i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex to be confusing br br the movie is set in the future a man james cole bruce willis is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past 1996 to be specific a virus killed 5 billion people he is sent from the future to get some information about it also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end br br one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post apocalyptic movies the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life you want to see the ocean be with her is especially a poignant line in this movie it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters br br the performances are quite good bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully i have to check out his other movies the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch ever since i saw this movie i have become so obsessed with her she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him br br the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary br br good thriller 10 10
<START> due to the invention of a the domestication collar flesh eating zombies are brought under control and become productive members of society however they perform menial tasks the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s styled small towns while untamed zombies roam around in the wild zone in the town of willard pre teen k'sun ray as timmy robinson lives with parents carrie anne moss and dylan baker as helen and bill robinson alas the robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie their new neighbors the bottoms have six so to keep up the robinsons obtain zombie billy connolly as fido br br unfortunately mr connolly's domestication collar is damaged by an old lady's walker and he eats her then new and hungry zombies infest the town meanwhile young ray has grown attached to connolly the boy and his zombie are like tv's timmy and lassie and the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling zomcom authorities br br fido doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing wild zone but it is a colorful stylish and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore ray and the cast perform well individually with nubile zombie sonja bennett as tammy and owner tim blake nelson as theopolis the most memorable pair director andrew currie and crew including rob gray design jan kiesser photography don macdonald music and james willcock design deservedly won awards br br fido 2006 andrew currie k'sun ray carrie anne moss billy connolly dylan baker
<START> joel schumaker directs the script he co wrote and has a group of georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations the story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good there is a lot of wasted talent and time here the cast is more impressive than the movie featured are demi moore rob lowe judd nelson andrew mccarthy emilio estevez ally sheedy and mare winningham the most notable being mccarthy and moore lowe is quite obnoxious coming of age is not so damn easy
<START> this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tv looking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age and the examination day a point where 12 year olds must undergo a government required iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry it's pretty obvious they are worried i won't give anything away in the ending but i will say this there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night by today's standards we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching but why would his family ask this the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i haven't read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a 16 year ld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesn't go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college he's been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700 the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably 3 4 of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew
<START> bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van halen bring out a 3rd film
<START> this was one of the worst films i have ever seen br br i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film br br most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it er ok br br also trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work alas it does here as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous in an enclosed space with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea br br anyway about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation however if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate br br it pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made br br oh did i mention the last five minutes well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques absolutely priceless

<START> when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show salem the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good i'm not a fan of when they started introducing brad and dreamer cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if you're gonna have new people at least keep them i didn't like josh he was a tw t i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of libby it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years and mr craft as well if him and zelda got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into roxie miles morgan's house i didn't like theses people either it didn't really seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they're own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re runs were back and i was like whoo hoo lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now she's working at some magazine shop so they're putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if they're in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it zelda was reduced to a candle and she's about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it's appealing self through the seven years was salem the cat
