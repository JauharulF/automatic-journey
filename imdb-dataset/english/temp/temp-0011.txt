<START> the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay br br in a positive note kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid br br jason vanness
<START> this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture it's still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing there's no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie it's their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesn't make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichÃ©s but somehow manages to transport a story oi warning is full of clichÃ©s doesn't tell anything new or provocative and that's the sad thing about this movie it's far from any oi reality br br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael haneke christoph schlingensief oskar roehler hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel br br benny's video funny games die unberÃ¼hrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmÃ¤uschenstill br br out of ten because of the topic and the photography

<START> i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are i don't know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it's time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk i don't think it should be remade and bastardised like i said it's a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without mini's and michael caine i give it 10 10
<START> i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmo's moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don't know what a cosmo's moon is
<START> unremittingly bleak and depressing the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecq's controversial novel of the same name like many french films its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow or should that be slowly painful while this is an excellent and challenging film it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the 'right' mood to see it
<START> well i don't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie br br and talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives br br i would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it grade d imdb rating 3 10

<START> this is the page for house of exorcism but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of exorcism when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70's it was a critical success audiences responded well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass consumption no distributor would buy it so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa' seemingly with a chainsaw by removing just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new hideous additions so technically house of exorcism is not a bava film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is jarred out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different haircut begin to writhe on the ground making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my co k etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist rip off leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil bava himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again re surfacing on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films vandalised in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague
<START> this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme i used to love superman movies but this one made me want to shoot myself very poor acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero to summarize superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again who is now razing his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old and what about that lex luthor trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land please br br i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie only because i am not allowed to vote 0 if you have anything else to do with your time don't go to see this movie and even if you don't have anything else to do stay home and watch tv
<START> since the advent of literature people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love love that cannot be the israeli filmmaker eytan fox' latest film Âthe bubble is about that and then it is also not the title of the film refers to the Âbubble that is tel aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel the country's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with nablus a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film it doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints actually it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it the Âbubble of tel aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any western city teenage girls looking for britney spears' records a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol it is this Âbubble that also has the potential to lull one's mind into a false sense of reality br br the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and for the most part try to stay out of politics yelli the camp owner and manager of Âorna ella a hip cafe rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the Âcrap that surrounds them noam a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations lulu the only female of the lot is on the contrary linked to the israeli left although her political activities seem to be confined to Âraves against the occupation yelli and noam naturally don't object to participating in these lulu and her political friends make t shirts with the rave's logo put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets in other words predictable products of the Âbubble br br the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam's doorstep in tel aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border his name is ashraf he's palestinian and he's gay and he hasn't just come to hand back the id he has come to see noam without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam's flatmates he stays he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli's cafe having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew he doesn't have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity the sky is light blue and the air is sweet but it cannot last for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be br br at one point noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards they find a way of being together on another level a metaphysical one a level where no one else has access this is also where our couple arrives in the end and it couldn't have been much different for them not in today's israel br br Âthe bubble is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist Âthe bubble is also a beautiful film about people gay and straight inhabiting that strange city tel aviv shown through the eyes of people who really care about them the film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched
