<START> i rarely write reviews for imdb com but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies i'm not a hater and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many 10 best kung fu martial arts movies websites i'm now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut and paste jobs first of all there's barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16 9 enhanced
<START> the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay br br in a positive note kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid br br jason vanness
<START> this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture it's still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing there's no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie it's their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesn't make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichÃ©s but somehow manages to transport a story oi warning is full of clichÃ©s doesn't tell anything new or provocative and that's the sad thing about this movie it's far from any oi reality br br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael haneke christoph schlingensief oskar roehler hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel br br benny's video funny games die unberÃ¼hrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmÃ¤uschenstill br br out of ten because of the topic and the photography
<START> in april 1946 the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research argonne thereby became the first national laboratory it did not however remain at its original location in the argonne forest in 1947 it moved farther west from the windy city to a new site on illinois farmland when alvin weinberg visited argonne's director walter zinn in 1947 he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site when zinn described a heavy water reactor operating at one tenth the power of the materials testing reactor under design at oak ridge weinberg joked it would be simpler if zinn took the oak ridge design and operated the materials testing reactor at one tenth capacity the joke proved unintentionally prophetic br br the s 50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns it was built next to the k 25 power plant which provided the necessary steam much less efficient than k 25 the s 50 plant was torn down after the war br br concerned that the atomic energy commission research program might become too academic lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers and during a november visit to oak ridge he discussed with clark center manager of carbide carbon a subsidiary of union carbide corporation at oak ridge the possibility of the company assuming management of the laboratory br br prince henry of prussia arriving in washington and visiting the german embassy 1902 evidently with prince henry of prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers their were already concerns with the applications of new science with military applications the hohenzollern 1902 ii kaiser wilhelm's splendid yacht at the 34th st pier new york taken at the exact moment of prince henry's arrival and the raising of the royal standard if royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare wwi and wwii the quality of management control i presume br br thus did the commandos of operation swallow volunteer for a military mission or a business plan based on the security principles of laboratory management because supposedly their were no survivors and the ones who were caught in europe ordered to be executed of the 400 man commando team the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the german army against subversion and espionage acts of the state of germany br br the fÃ¼hrer no 003830 42 g kdos okw wfst fÃ¼hrer hq 18 oct 1942 signed adolph hitler translation of document no 498 ps office of u s chief of counsel certified true copy kipp major declassified dod 5200 30 march 23 1983 reproduced at the u s national archives br br the oss societyÂ® 6723 whittier ave 200 mclean va 22101
<START> i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are i don't know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it's time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk i don't think it should be remade and bastardised like i said it's a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without mini's and michael caine i give it 10 10
<START> i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmo's moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don't know what a cosmo's moon is
<START> unremittingly bleak and depressing the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecq's controversial novel of the same name like many french films its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow or should that be slowly painful while this is an excellent and challenging film it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the 'right' mood to see it
<START> well i don't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie br br and talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives br br i would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it grade d imdb rating 3 10
<START> to make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism 1 we are never told why these people believe this 2 location is new years eve in toronto canada so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight why based on the costumes did it seem like september br br 3 the acting was in that neo au natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it br br 4 the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the film br br rating 1 2 out of 4 2 on imdb scale br br thank you i am as always br br jay harris aka sirbossman

<START> this is the page for house of exorcism but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of exorcism when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70's it was a critical success audiences responded well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass consumption no distributor would buy it so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa' seemingly with a chainsaw by removing just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new hideous additions so technically house of exorcism is not a bava film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is jarred out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different haircut begin to writhe on the ground making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my co k etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist rip off leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil bava himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again re surfacing on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films vandalised in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague
<START> this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme i used to love superman movies but this one made me want to shoot myself very poor acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero to summarize superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again who is now razing his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old and what about that lex luthor trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land please br br i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie only because i am not allowed to vote 0 if you have anything else to do with your time don't go to see this movie and even if you don't have anything else to do stay home and watch tv
