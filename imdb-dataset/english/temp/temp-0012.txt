<START> since the advent of literature people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love love that cannot be the israeli filmmaker eytan fox' latest film Âthe bubble is about that and then it is also not the title of the film refers to the Âbubble that is tel aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel the country's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with nablus a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film it doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints actually it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it the Âbubble of tel aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any western city teenage girls looking for britney spears' records a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol it is this Âbubble that also has the potential to lull one's mind into a false sense of reality br br the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and for the most part try to stay out of politics yelli the camp owner and manager of Âorna ella a hip cafe rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the Âcrap that surrounds them noam a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations lulu the only female of the lot is on the contrary linked to the israeli left although her political activities seem to be confined to Âraves against the occupation yelli and noam naturally don't object to participating in these lulu and her political friends make t shirts with the rave's logo put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets in other words predictable products of the Âbubble br br the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam's doorstep in tel aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border his name is ashraf he's palestinian and he's gay and he hasn't just come to hand back the id he has come to see noam without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam's flatmates he stays he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli's cafe having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew he doesn't have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity the sky is light blue and the air is sweet but it cannot last for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be br br at one point noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards they find a way of being together on another level a metaphysical one a level where no one else has access this is also where our couple arrives in the end and it couldn't have been much different for them not in today's israel br br Âthe bubble is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist Âthe bubble is also a beautiful film about people gay and straight inhabiting that strange city tel aviv shown through the eyes of people who really care about them the film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched
<START> when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there so i couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre what a disappointment the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over with hardly any plot and no substance and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed some of these so called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive the only good things about this film were the wardrobe music and acting it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's and the same goes for the music and the acting was top notch throughout almost all of hollywood's best comedians were present too bad they didn't have better material to work with
<START> my complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment tc or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown also the movie crawls along in covering c 1920 1939 and then steams through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels' life still i found it wanting
<START> i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in she falls in love but when spring comes along she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her on br br it's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has he can't part from what he loves the most that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is br br it's a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one
<START> standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process rÃ¥narna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense br br banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient military styled gang of robbers two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first br br as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again mikael persbrandt must be in every swedish film from the last few years but that's ok i guess since persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here like he usually does the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself first of all the robberies feel mostly like background rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then it spiced things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step br br in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind mostly hollywood it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting and forget about trying to make hollywood action light like they do now because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie industry i rate it 3 10
<START> over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous chucks wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm preying on the group in various violent ways br br registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the u k in the 1980s the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term 'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks alt title expecting a sleazy slasher experience and that's what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the film's not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail it's simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but that's about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isn't cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it's a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for 90 000 which would be over double that today the dorm that dripped blood isn't a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces it just cannot compare don't expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films i've seen that would actually be better with a remake and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well br br obligatory horror elements br br subgenre slasher br br violence gore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part but nothing special also they off screened some of the best murders br br sex nudity there's a little unappealing to me nudity but not very much br br cool killer s nah the ending monologue s of the killer made him her pretty uncool br br scares suspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effective br br mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didn't care enough and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face br br br br final verdict 3 75 10 bah humbug br br ap3
<START> just kidding br br seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gump like joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street thugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive br br while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra urban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his out of place position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo br br midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure hearted and out of place lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between country cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend br br 8 5 10
<START> despite louis b mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful it's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce it simply looks beautiful even 84 years later br br as for garbo herself like her other very early american films she too looks different while she's quite recognizable her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn't see in subsequent films i kind of wish they'd kept this look but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look who am i to say they shouldn't have gone that route the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord while the landlady the much esteemed doÃ±a bernarda claims it's because the bank has demanded payment it's because her son has fallen for garbo and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets nice lady huh years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world famous when she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother doÃ±a bernarda refused to allow it sees her his new love for another lady is now tested will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame and more importantly will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly in the meantime a huge rainstorm hits the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes then he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe she tells him to get lost next you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the pork king he obviously has little enthusiasm for this and you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong soon cortez is seen wandering back to garbo's home he's love sick and needs her in this scene garbo is quite luminous and can't tell him to leave as they dissolve in each other's arms once again he tells her of his love for her br br when doÃ±a bernarda learns of this she is not pleased evidently a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer because of the meddling of this nasty old lady garbo leaves unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son but cortez comes running announcing he must have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife moments after making this proclamation a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation so much for won't rest until he has her for his wife huh despite cortez being a wimp through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him and so he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life when years later garbo meets cortez again he is a dull looking middle aged man while she is as beautiful as ever and not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lost br br at the time this film was made garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was so in light of this it's surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play instead of the usual confident valentino like role they'd been giving him here he is an indecisive wimp a huge wimp and from here on his career was on a slow downward spiral as for garbo the role helped establish her as a big star as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas br br as for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive the print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards which could use some restoration br br a most enjoyable film expertly constructed wistful and worth seeing and for one of the few times i can think of it i have no real complaints in this excellent film
<START> i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production while a comedy oldies radio dj in 1988 i got a call from the production company they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv the television screen itself would never be shown i said sure wrote a parody of '50s sci fi monster clichÃ©s rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj pam landry to play the female part as she happened to be on the air at the time she put on a long song joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take giggling she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects we'd have never done it if we'd known that woodchipper massacre was going to be such a turkey but then again we never got paid for our efforts either gary theroux
<START> i just saw this film i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end so i watched it like 10 minutes ago and i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne marie because she said 'i love you charlie' and also 'i'll miss you charlie' just made me really cry ha ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha ha thats all i can say xd br br but i love this film its a true classic br br xx maverick xx 10 10
<START> spoilers in as far as i describe characters and their relation to the plot br br this is a quality film the subject matter is at once grim and gripping the dogged determination of stephen rea's character burakov is simply captivating with any due apologies to him his hangdog continually put upon expression serves the character well he is as we in england would say of the inspector taggart tv series character bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week well that's not strictly accurate as chikatila operated over a number of years br br you get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the ussr bureaucracy brilliantly portrayed by joss ackland who often seems made for this sort of role br br a key character and i write this as the remake of invasion of the body snatchers is being shown on bbc1 is the donald sutherland character mikhail fetisov his quiet support of burakov is steadfast and it endures through perestroika and drives the involvement of the fbi for profiling brilliant br br this is a must see as far as i am concerned
<START> this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen i haven't seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clichÃ©s and the story doesn't ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don't think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good
