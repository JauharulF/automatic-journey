<START> years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes for the uninitiated john cassavettes was an actor screen writer and director married to actress gena rowlands nominated for oscars three times who wrote and directed a variety of good low budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat up until seeing the incubus we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether but we did not walk out at the time my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made now frankly this is not true i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax did i just say that out loud that are far worse than the incubus almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus however i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better or worse than the incubus br br http thevillagevideot blogspot com
<START> when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it at the time i was eleven years old so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum i really had no intentions of watching it but then i decided to go back and re watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions so i went out and bought both the original movies and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them identity i found the superior of the two but supremacy isn't far behind they're both slick action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint br br matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley but i never thought much of him in general however it appears he was born to play bourne pardon the pun throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes in this movie we see matt damon at his very best even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy here she excels herself her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles well decent roles than she gets david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels he's definitely the nastiest character we've met and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time i will not say anything about the character that's best left as a surprise but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie br br the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts that very final scene in supremacy in new york a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups all very violent and shockingly brutal a bike chase that is absolutely amazing many foot chases which are even more amazing a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable and oh so much more but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped br br so any flaws for the movie in my eyes no but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series it is definitely nearly its equal
<START> several years ago the navy kept a studied distance away from the making of men of honor a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism ever eager to support films showing our navy's best side the u s s nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers with supporting shore installations were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage some of the movie was shot aboard the u s s belleau wood br br antwone fisher wrote the script for denzel washington's director's debut in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating fisher played effectively and deeply by derek luke br br fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the u s s belleau wood lha 3 a front line helicopter assault platform fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men sent to the m d as part of a possible pre separation proceeding fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality br br the story develops as fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest an enlisted sailor named cheryl played by a stunningly beautiful joy bryant br br fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers however painful in order to grow and move away from conflict seeking destructive behavior br br while all the main characters are black this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings viola davis a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom mrs tate novella nelson who in short but searing scenes would earn if it existed the oscar for gut churning brutality br br films about patient therapist interaction follow a certain predictability all that transference and counter transference stuff but the earnestness of fisher and his doctor mentor is realistically gripping it's a good story well told period br br while set in the navy antwone fisher is not in any real sense a service story as was men of honor an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person nor is it truly a film about blacks it's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and as fisher says being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still standing tall the persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor br br my only quibble is that washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander with all the navy support people listed in the end credits someone should have told director washington that his character like all naval officers below the rank of commander is addressed as mister not a big criticism is it br br i don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters it deserves wide distribution derek luke may well get an oscar nomination br br 8 10 br br
<START> how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was and still is the best document of texas life for the time period consider the following men beat their wives get drunk at bars nightly get married to settle a fight commit adultery and compete on mechanical bulls try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly they dont make them anymore it seems current films are always about people with lots of money they live in huge homes drive expensive cars and don't work this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake br br anyway i watch it at least once a week no kidding i have dissected this movie from end to end feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary consider the following scenes bud sees sissy they are split up he amicably honks and waves she flips him the bird he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off br br buds mom calls him approx 18 hours after he gets into town on a sunday to see if he has a job yet all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid x2 with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him br br you all live like pigs think about why this scene is needed think about it was it necessary could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink god i love that br br sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull only a few days or possibly the next day after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband steve asks hey sissy remember wes oh yeah didnt you beat my husband up the other night so let's get this lesson goin' to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy's many fights which by the way all take place in public in gilley's br br the wedding reception picture taking session oh the humanity could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way my legs are sweatin' momma br br in conclusion you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology it is a documentary of real life br br i only wish there was a director's cut
<START> in 1978 a phenomenon began the release of john carpenter's halloween got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers the critics loved it the world loved it it was imitated and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history br br plot 15 years after a murder took place four friends all females are babysitting and having it on with their boyfriends on halloween night after escaping from a hospital the night before michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety he does not speak he walks slowly he hides br br only one of the friends escapes after being saved by doctor loomis michael's pursuer and doctor br br there is one reason why halloween works so well simplicity we don't know where michael is we don't know why he kills and he frightens us they're the only reasons why we are afraid br br john carpenter wrote the movie and directed he builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch and the climax is truly startling br br as horror this is essential it is terrifying and well acted it is also mysterious michael is a force not a human a force that cannot be denied br br the sequels focused too much around michael and his history this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece
<START> i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while what with all it's raving reviews nominations and media attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie was good it really portrayed the black music scene back then however as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent br br furthermore i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters i just didn't care what happened to them even when eddie murphy's character died of a drug overdose i knew i should have been sad but i just couldn't feel any emotion for that character the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in br br finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances
<START> for me this movie just seemed to fall on its face the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer i don't know whether this grows out of type casting or simply his demeanor but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain he's a good guy and that's always obvious in his performances other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story nothing very innovative
<START> in a not so conventional sense of the word br br this movie was one of my favorites as a young child and i just recently remembered it and thought to look it up while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years br br if parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then i highly recommend this movie it taught me a lot about life and death and brought forth in me a lot of emotion to this day it remains one of my favorite films
<START> title robot jox 1990 br br director stuart gordon br br cast gary graham anne marie johnson paul koslo br br review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re animator from beyond dagon and castle freak took a small detour here and did a little sci fi flick i stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick and there in lies its main weakness br br the story takes place in the future a world in which the great superpowers that according to this movie are the united states and russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues br br well the idea is awesome i guess the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director br br i as a kid loved this movie and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco and i'm like well this movie is a sci fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture i could go through it cause i loved this film as a kid and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it but everyone else was just not going to get it br br and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good first off the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief but unfortunately this being a small scale movie from a small scale company empire pictures which went bankrupt after making this film the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed br br ok granted once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool and made me go thats why i liked thid movie but every know and them some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in and boom your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise br br and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie this movie is basically a movie for kids you know giant robots duking it out stop motion animation hello but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities which really isn't a good mix br br so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie like i do well id suggest you steer clear away from this one gordons a great director but this movie he made just didn't do it for me well at least not now that i'm a full grown adult br br rating 2 out of 5
<START> while i can't deny that his movies are often entertaining i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream look at me aren't i an imaginative director his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative raging bull br br for this remake it appears it was business as usual though the dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself the melodramatic close ups combined with the sub par imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror the score for psycho was brilliantly unnerving this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature' the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden family br br the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away now i'm no expert on american accents me originally coming from near manchester in england an' all but surely he could've come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite it was disconcerting for me as a de niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performance br br possible spoilers br br the over the top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer not dead yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ br br all in all a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller' scorsese and de niro have done much better work together
