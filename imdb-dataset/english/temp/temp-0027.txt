<START> you'd better choose paul verhoeven's even if you have watched it
<START> it was a doubly interesting experience for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar where like a deus ex ma china the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain intent on stealing some machines of theirs it is notable that in those two cases and in iq we are dealing with comedies so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro magnetic field theory into exciting dialog but then only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind maybe nobody really has tried br br subsequently after writing this i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago but that is an exception and it was a spoof br br the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert it was walter matthau here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor in both comedy and drama but normally his comic personas were variants of his whiplash willie gingrich from the fortune cookie they were connivers and gonifs later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them but they remained grumpy types but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet more like his kotch than like willie clarke br br he plays albert as good old uncle albert it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd meg ryan and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland stephen fry but fry's car needs repairs and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters tim robbins works robbins falls for ryan who is attracted to him but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires good old uncle albert aided by his three friends lou jacobi joseph maher and gene saks decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things as he hopes to do br br the atmosphere is sweet as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on by switching the positions of their bodies the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower keene curtis br br it was a charming comedy and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal but far more subdued
<START> honestly my expectations for little bush were low i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun but rehashed and overdone bush jokes apparently i should have lowered my expectations even more br br the writing was absolutely pathetic aside from the cheney chicken eating joke and some giggly little swipes it was really boring and unfunny br br the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen year old's flash project it's disgraceful that they used macromedia's product for this because it's capable of so much more br br i don't like bush that much and i enjoy a bush joke as much as the next guy but this was just a half hour swipe at the president with several painfully un funny moments trey parker and matt stone did so much more with that's my bush br br do yourself a favor skip lil' bush and go buy a copy of the short lived comedy that's my bush you'll thank me
<START> i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard lots of yawning though paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so called comedic movie
<START> words can't describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro what were you thinking so there's a mall and its parking space is totally full basinger's character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper br br when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place come on i won't even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one br br this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it it's a total waste of time honestly
<START> a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must
<START> this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day it's pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit 1 2
<START> this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories br br i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der gucht's singing
<START> sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn't even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
<START> while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on even my a d d couldn't keep up it felt like a slight acid trip everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything there were so many shapes lines and patterns i really wanted to stop the movie mid way and smash my burned copy of this movie but after i finish watching it i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching br br the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells a small boy brendan is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written this book will contain information that will help change darkness into light brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls taking place in the 8th century brendan's uncle the abbot of kells is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out brendan's uncle insist he help complete the wall but a traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out it's word br br the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn't really understand what was going on i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells after reading many articles my opinion of the movie greatly changed br br the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century along with it's paleographic and insular script the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art a type of early art form know for it's intricacy complexity and miniature illustrations much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors br br the secret of kells is very colorful i originally thought the animation was flat and boring it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and amine look to it once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan's mind whenever he goes into his imagination circular shapes resembling the sun cogs clocks and wheels begin filling the screen the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles transitions are filled with color and celtic knots from the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns br br clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested i think one has to generally be open mined to the secret of kells as half art piece half movie about history despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator it's a very nice looking movie but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration i don't think it was worth being nominated over mary and max br br thatwasjunk blogspot com
<START> many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game or even the first shoot 'em up it's also one of the first stealth games one of the only and definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty well rounded gaming experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game thrusts you into the role of b j don't even think i'm going to attempt spelling his last name an american p o w caught in an underground bunker you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes but let's face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that however and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then you've got one heck of a good shooter sneaking game the game play consists of searching for keys health and ammo blasting enemies aforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficulty which of course grows as you move further in the game unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you were basically if you beat the 'par time' which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many play throughs how much nazi gold treasure you collected and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got 100 of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the coveted high score placings the game mostly but not always allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is gunshots many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly silently in your inventory you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys unlock certain doors most doors in the game aren't locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levels you restart in levels resetting weaponry health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just alluded to this game like many of the period late 80's early 90's is based on collecting extra lives personally i think it's completely and utterly useless it was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next 3d shooter and onwards since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry health and ammo like starting on a new chapter which is a real pain in later levels where you need heavier artillery now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knife which is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for conserving ammo unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german smg a sub machine gun it's faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a gatling gun oh yeah think t2 think predator think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies however that's for each player to discover for him or her self the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machine gun firing the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems that segues me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than once though that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of humidity and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isn't terribly high what there is is great remains of victims guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for it's limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters sure weapon bobbing and different height levels stairs and such didn't come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view so it goes beyond simply left and right adding vertical dimensions to it and jumping didn't come around until a third later title the first quake possibly fellow gamers help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the luger open the door to enter the bunker and step into b j 's shoes he deserves the recognition even or maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of 3d games 8 10
<START> an end of an era was released here in the states in spring 2002 with the rookie a disney live action film that seemed to be the best for last it took place right here in texas actually the story began in west texas as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional br br what i liked about this movie it was sooo nice it was a very good sports movie ala the mighty ducks trilogy it had also taken moviegoers across texas from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex where i live i can tell because i recognize that ballpark was the ballpark in arlington now it's ameriquest field it was nice to see disney's golden age end here in my area br br r i p br br golden age of disney br br 1920s spring 2002 br br it all started with a mouse and it ended with baseball sobs br br 10 10
