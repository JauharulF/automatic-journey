<START> following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to cheÂstruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties the change of setting isn't just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle yet as che would go on to say himselfÂsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thatÂa struggle while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that part two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner br br while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible this somewhat distant cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manÂif anything the entirety of che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who Âarguably conducted the whole thing br br yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points here the basic structure of part one is echoed backÂthere's the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming and disquieting note this difference in combination with the similarities to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve br br indeed everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesÂthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged in fact upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review as a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively br br with that said i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that with a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'the fiend' targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'the fiend' and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br taking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzman's lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end 1930s traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silent talkie crossover cast perform it amiably br br a face in the fog 2 1 36 robert f hill lloyd hughes june collyer al st john
<START> i was very pleased to go and see a milanese film shot in milan alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy br br film tells the story of a standard in career milanese couple starting from the birth to the death the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the urbe of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher then finally the product a child who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle's director br br the actors are well chosen stefania rocca nice and well characterised and a positive surprise an unexpected good fabio volo well known by the trash tv serie le iene br br rating 7 10
<START> simply i found the tv show mash trite preachy oh ever so politically correct repetitious pretentious and biggest sin of all and that is that it is was incredibly dull you have alan alda as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his cleverness that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both mclean stevson and wayne rogers whom i'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike farrell both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread loretta swit which i also found dull also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at and gary burghoff who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on seeing one show a year showed that to me jamie farr was just low brow comedy and is not even worth really mentioning here at all the reason i did not give it a one rating which anyone reading this by now would be wondering is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call but a relative one television except for relatively few exceptions is such crud that relatively speaking mash had some production quality by television standards of that era and today and therefore it is deserved of a two rob ritter

<START> roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemary's baby and chinatown probably what makes polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horror suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done br br polanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building br br while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films repulsion rosemary's baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky's head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant br br trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film br br also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive br br if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one br br while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksi's masterpieces 10 10

<START> i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition br br if you didn't notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain he's driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunion br br i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention
<START> this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor what is he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover blade surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left what happened with the other 10 15 vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun that's really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality
<START> this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here there's an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointment br br that said there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
<START> wait don't tell me they threw out the movie and kept the out takes you know this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york the gangster bangster i guess gangster rap designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k mart hats budget rent a horsie it seems supplied the horsies the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words i though it was him talking you know watching this movie just confirms that it isn't about the acting anymore its about looks and it's about the money couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made just one more thing though where was ice t did he finally get to go on oprah
