<START> a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'the fiend' targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'the fiend' and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br taking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzman's lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end 1930s traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silent talkie crossover cast perform it amiably br br a face in the fog 2 1 36 robert f hill lloyd hughes june collyer al st john
<START> i was very pleased to go and see a milanese film shot in milan alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy br br film tells the story of a standard in career milanese couple starting from the birth to the death the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the urbe of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher then finally the product a child who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle's director br br the actors are well chosen stefania rocca nice and well characterised and a positive surprise an unexpected good fabio volo well known by the trash tv serie le iene br br rating 7 10
<START> simply i found the tv show mash trite preachy oh ever so politically correct repetitious pretentious and biggest sin of all and that is that it is was incredibly dull you have alan alda as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his cleverness that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both mclean stevson and wayne rogers whom i'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike farrell both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread loretta swit which i also found dull also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at and gary burghoff who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on seeing one show a year showed that to me jamie farr was just low brow comedy and is not even worth really mentioning here at all the reason i did not give it a one rating which anyone reading this by now would be wondering is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call but a relative one television except for relatively few exceptions is such crud that relatively speaking mash had some production quality by television standards of that era and today and therefore it is deserved of a two rob ritter

<START> roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemary's baby and chinatown probably what makes polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horror suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done br br polanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building br br while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films repulsion rosemary's baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky's head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant br br trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film br br also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive br br if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one br br while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksi's masterpieces 10 10

<START> i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition br br if you didn't notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain he's driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunion br br i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention
<START> this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor what is he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover blade surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left what happened with the other 10 15 vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun that's really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality
<START> this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here there's an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointment br br that said there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
<START> wait don't tell me they threw out the movie and kept the out takes you know this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york the gangster bangster i guess gangster rap designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k mart hats budget rent a horsie it seems supplied the horsies the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words i though it was him talking you know watching this movie just confirms that it isn't about the acting anymore its about looks and it's about the money couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made just one more thing though where was ice t did he finally get to go on oprah
<START> this is a low budget scream style movie maddy is a new worker at a conspicuously unnamed office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co worker chris during a hot tub party chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a murder club where everyone has killed someone for kicks when maddy loses it and kills someone for real hijinks ensue br br the film looks good and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level nudity gore maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast but after the credits roll you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
