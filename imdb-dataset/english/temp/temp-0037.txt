<START> anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead ' in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers ' and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill ' br br 'dillinger ' released in 1973 is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole 'dillinger' is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius 'magnum force' but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career br br the 109 minute 'dillinger' epic for aip's scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 'dillinger' is basically a chase film with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover br br 'dillinger' has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life br br this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn't there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde ' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot 'em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail br br aside from this the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them br br warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent br br as a piece of 1970s exploitation 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it's certainly worth checking out br br out of 4 br br roving reviewer www geocities com paul johnr
<START> how can this movie have a 5 5 this movie was a piece of skunk s t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw it second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t v show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s t they call a movie br br rating 0 3
<START> after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb br br 'the fantastic mr fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or 'foxy' as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded boggins bunce and bean that's right one short one fat one lean or however it goes br br i don't quite know where to start with my criticism br br well i'm in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults i'm still unsure many of the 'jokes' would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of i'm assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens i'm all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their necks surely that's a bit much and also the plot well it's kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions br br the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and sleek but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didn't even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelve years old in fox years sounds like he's about 30 br br i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit characters are tall spindly and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs it actually freaked me out br br fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasn't for me
<START> i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved naive high school graduates best friends since childhood take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer yankee hank hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice claire dane however the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene beckinsale had me in tears i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it
<START> i've been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting of course i am catholic come from a well educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill's opinions br br bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative he's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i e one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god but that said he never looks at its positive side quite frankly i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor she's dead now of course but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit usc's institute for advanced catholic studies which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than 1 a day of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes br br that fits into the other large problem with bill's movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is in this movie you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ and with an actor playing jesus at a holy land theme park br br what you won't see in bill's film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame byu or wheaton college who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter you won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c s lewis g k chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non abrahamic judaism christianity and islam faiths whatsoever all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it br br i get a lot of what bill's saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies
<START> it is of course very nice to see improvements on turkish movie industry however i would have expected something more creative from togan gokbakar starting from the script which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think especially the cheesiness of the dialogs which were putting the audience in a position that as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations which most of the times makes the movie unbearable it also has an obvious ending you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people like professionals right away did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film and that scene was so suitable for dikkat sahan cikabilir title those are not the only weak parts of the movie there were also a lot of preciosities in the film the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from hannibal also appearance of togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it gen is a total disappointment i would have wonder if sahan was not this famous would togan be able to shoot this movie with this much of budget amount i hope togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview it was hitchcock who did it wisely and night shyamalan continued it successfully he should be aware of the fact that he is not hitchcock nor shyamalan yet hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry

<START> if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill cobbs you don't need billy burke coolio or any other distractions massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script my neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime i wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with merk
<START> the 1980s tv show updated with fresh female flesh and raunchy language the dukes of hazzard passed me by it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california or i probably would have watched still from somewhere like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release i knew it was about a fast orange dodge charger and the general lee is still good to go br br hunky cousins seann william scott and johnny knoxville as bo and luke duke are the new riders of the orange sage beautiful jessica simpson as daisy fills her skimpy short well but even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing topless coeds the too stupid plot involves a graying burt reynolds as boss hogg threatening to turn hazzard county into a strip mine br br the dukes of hazzard 7 27 05 jay chandrasekhar seann william scott johnny knoxville jessica simpson burt reynolds
<START> i began watching this movie with my girl friend and after 5 minutes i was alone br br i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experience br br i liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie br br there are only 5 characters and the rest could be called 'art' or something that i couldn't express but that i didn't understand at all br br the only worst movie i saw was crash but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again br br good luck o
<START> i have to say as a bsg fan i wasn't exactly sure what i'd think of this show i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight as part of the paley center screenings and the cast and film makers spoke after wards ron moore said they 'wanted to make a clean break from battlestar and do something different and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others br br even without their talk i am now a fan of the new show but here's what i thought of the film br br i loved it it was really very good i guess i'm a true sci fi or 'syfy' do i really have to type that geek because i'd totally watch this as a series it has a strong and rich story and kept my interest br br it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing the actor playing ben should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs the actress playing zoe seemed a little posy but she was playing a teenager and i'm sure i won't be the only one who thought zoe was a cylon at first perils of being a bsg geek if they're hoping these will be the new bamber helfer park they may want to rethink it surprisingly it was the adults that captured the audiences attention br br eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters traps her then dismisses and releases her no sign at all of the 'serial killer' he played on gray's anatomy really impressive acting br br equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltz's part and i completely believed that they are a couple and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship something rarely seen these days i look forward to seeing what happens with this family and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid you cringe it's really great not to mention her eyes which could hold magical powers that's how intense they are the scene where she takes on the government agent very short scene but beautifully played really gives you an idea of her power br br the other part of the show that did not work 100 for me were the scenes with esai morales and the mafia type clan of his he does a good job overall but i did not believe in this mobs power nor intimidated by their threats i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit but given time i can see how this will develop into an interesting 'upstairs downstairs' kind of thing with the poor minorities morales et al versus the rich folk who rule the planet stolz et al and to be honest i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name that was a very well played scene br br note to bsg fans the boy playing 'willy adama' doesn't really look much like olmos but he's just a kid whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film who knows i sure couldn't tell but it didn't bother me because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him br br polly walker plays 'sister clarice' and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in i'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with but i was very impressed with her acting in this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on she was nothing like her character in rome something i always find impressive in actors br br one nice surprise the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg even though it's the same guy doing it bear mccreary it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise i'd buy this score if i had the chance br br as to the 'panel discussion' after the show it was hosted by seth green ron moore was very smart and articulate david eick was cracking wise much like his video diaries esai morales told a long story about how he was cast and eric stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions but i've always had a thing for him paula malcomson was tough she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on '24' and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling grace park and tricia helfer were there as well answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg overall a very interesting and wonderful evening br br i'm giving the show a 9 out of 10 and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold br br note i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for i have no idea what that may be but it holds a great deal of fascination to me
