<START> this quasi j horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends she finds that one the daughter of the village priestess drowned several years earlier she and fumiko another childhood friend then learn that sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie unlike stellar j horror films the suspense doesn't really build the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd br br this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long you end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is chinese or japanese food without rice but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey gooey tastelessness of it all 3 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
<START> i was so impressed with doug mcgrath's film version of the jane austen novel emma and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re united for nicholas nickleby i immediately rented it without any other consideration br br i have read the book and for those overly critical fans of this jane austen adaptation i don't know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen's work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long and as far as gwen paltrow's accent is concerned i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress br br i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker then perhaps you should rent something like death wish iii br br the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story br br this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist the story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touching br br i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite
<START> huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classic br br it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's infinitely better than the american pie's that plague us now br br there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of '84 three o'clock high and the cheesy yet gripping doesn't seem possible river's edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it br br i love you riff randell br br 10 10
<START> this film was probably inspired by godard's masculin fÃ©minin and i urge you to see that film instead br br the film has two strong elements and those are 1 the realistic acting 2 the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film it's unattractive comparing to godard's film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society br br a movie of its time and place 2 10
<START> the morbid catholic writer gerard reve jeroen krabbÃ© that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen while in the railway station in amsterdam he feels a non corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag renÃ©e soutendijk who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx and they have one night stand on the next morning gerard sees the picture of christine's boyfriend herman thom hoffman and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of seducing the man christine travels to kÃ¶ln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe finding three film reels with names of men he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband br br the ambiguous the vierde man is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs magnificent performance of jeroen krabbÃ© in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer and stunning cinematography the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films however paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism last but not the least the androgynous beauty of the sexy renÃ©e soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer my vote is eight br br title brazil o 4o homem the 4th man

<START> the first home alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90's the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes now comes home alone 3 i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997 he could take care of himself right so what does the director decide to do he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie but please i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it it's not worth your precious time go fold a piece of paper do chores balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap it's better to do then to watch home alone 3 br br 1 10
<START> ice age is not only animation of the year in my eyes it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen br br the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website scrat is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes br br the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed it's hard to say which one really steals the picture br br i experienced their journey with laughter tears and amazement nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 also a fox production and before that it was the land before time 1988 all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the cynics 10 10 br br
<START> i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a sermon i'll go to church but i don't want one from a movie i don't mind some supernatural themes after all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had horns br br and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained herein
<START> this movie is one of the many kung fu action films made in asia in the late '70s early '80s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies they hire a con artist gordon liu to try to scare them off when his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real but instead of making him a kung fu student the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers well it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he's learning the skills to be a kung fu expert it's sort of like in karate kid when mr miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores wax on wax off et cetera there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors this time it's not just tricks it's the real thing liu declares proudly thumping his chest if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one
<START> peter m cohen has a winner satire on the mating game twisted around and turned inside out the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as offensive and raunchy only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions it is in the tradition of what i call reality based satire following in the footsteps of in the company of men chasing amy your friends and neighbors and two girls and a guy cohen's dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations brian van holt zorie barber and jonathan abrahams are three distinct unrelenting sex obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy superbly played by judah domke are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator amanda peet underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar coated studio products
<START> this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them we know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car and that is what happens now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap now how is he going to get out of it that's what you must discover by yourself and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river we also know when he is going to be wounded they did not know what bullet proof jackets were in those days it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq but what is the meaning of such a film this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
