<START> kalifornia is one of my all time favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90 s the film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others one of the film s strongest aspects is it s performances brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer trash psycho named early pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heart breaking kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality there are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a power house climax that will haunt you for days kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for it s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for it s violence and gore
<START> i couldn't believe it i had to rub my eyes a few times was it true br br yes there were billy dee williams jeff conaway maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax style skin flick set on board a spaceship br br sad as it is alien intruder tries to be unique with a computer virus alien demon harpy whatever else you want to call her named ariel scoggins infiltrating this sort of high tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over seen by their captain williams br br interesting maybe but here everything just plays out like a well padded episode of red shoe diaries williams out classes everything right and left and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else anywhere else ah the things people do for money br br the fx are pretty static maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight to video cheapie like this unfortunately even the female nudity is less than you'd expect sexual innuendo is the real star here and of course it gets all the best scenes br br if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains check out alien intruder of course you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning br br no stars not even for what star power this flick can muster br br leave this one lost in space
<START> following the release of cube 2 hypercube 2003 and playing off the alleged success of the original cube 1998 director ernie barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy the prequel cube zero br br deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution time and place unknown two low ranking operators wynn zachary bennett and dodd david huband sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers some of which are rigged with death traps told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection these observers have had no problem with their jobs until wynn a mathematical genius discovers that one of the prisoners a woman named cassandra stephanie moore never agreed to be put inside the cube suddenly it's realized that perhaps their jobs are not what they seem and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted br br for people that have seen and enjoyed the original cube this prequel will probably not be to your liking it's not that the story does not have potential it's simply that the first cube film never needed to be expanded on standing alone it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message it was also nicely self contained the problem with cube zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing br br what this new film has to offer which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil certainly are good questions to be raised but probably should have been done so on their own merits rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations br br having said this the other traits of the film such as acting and direction and writing are not awful there is a bleak dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'the matrix' and 'dark city' and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube unfortunately for barbarash these are not enough positive qualities to save it
<START> a question for all you girls out there if a man you ve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you d phone the police yeah that s what i thought so i couldn t swallow the idea of marti gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of connor hill br br mild spoilers br br this is a really dumb story connor hill s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor phoning marti so he can have an alibi but there s a massive gap in logic here couldn t connor have employed a hit man something the prosecution seem to have ignored and wasn t there any forensics at the murder scene so why does the whole trial rest on connor phoning marti at the time of the murder dumb dumb dumb and it s as predictable as it is brainless br br my abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter olympics marti gerrard is a really crap downhill skier

<START> i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for last comic standing if they don't have a good agent then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80 of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent if they do make it to an audition i was told that it's pre determined if they get a second chance so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us br br if the comics do make it to the show then most of them don't get imdb credits i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of last comic standing and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job it's really a disgrace a month ago i asked last comic standing 7 on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this i just want people to know the truth i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians comedians get exploited on hbo bet tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen br br please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized http www youtube com watch v rmb4 hyet y
<START> john schlesinger's 'midnight cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only x rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didn't really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didn't consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners Â a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybody's talking' at me i don't hear a word they're sayin' make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever released br br young joe buck then newcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new york br br joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as naÃ¯ve as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck's classic novel 'of mice and men ' br br shot largely on the streets of new york 'midnight cowboy' is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso's squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in 1967's 'the graduate ' both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting Â bafflingly Â was sylvia miles for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in 'true grit ' 'midnight cowboy' eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt br br 'midnight cowboy' is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe's past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating 'midnight cowboy' is one for the ages
<START> spoilers spoilers br br this movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine i've got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very sceptical br br upon viewing i was surprised br br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and it's all good br br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitles br br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research it's all good br br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war it's a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect it's a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i 52 it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck br br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i can't remember it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again it's all good br br plot wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and it's crew one of the visitors a man in his 50's has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever found br br what to expect br br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprise br br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem it's not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtle br br overall really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while yes a child's story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nice br br medusa 2001 br br
<START> a huge hit upon release with australian audiences it can still be funny today but its over the top political incorrectness and blunt unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer it goes on far too long some of br br the content could have been saved for the sequel barry mckenzie holds his own which desperately needed some new stuff anyway granted his ocker aussie attitude is funny but also becomes annoying as the film drags on some say crocker's songs are the best bits and they are certainly original but hilarious the adventures of barry mckenzie will go down as a landmark in australian cinema but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of australians as barry mckenzies or for that matter mick dundees rating 5 10
<START> the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written br br i first saw this movie back in 1978 79 when i first subscribed to cable in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri br br this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early 1980's i received a free month of the star channel with my new cable subscription the van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time br br i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flick along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties br br i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere 4 99 br br seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was is however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now 30 years later br br it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking weed and having sex in the back a fancy van often all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should be br br there isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van with shag carpet walls mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it to get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a preppy lesser attractive girl that he half ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier better off and the movie ends br br the movie does have it's funny moments but watching this movie 30 years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza parlors pinball arcades it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes i'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the backseat afterwords i also remember many of the songs in this move when they were new this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memories br br the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i don't young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the 70's self included wanting a pontiac trans am chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang but never a van this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one which just wasn't true of that era
<START> the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes br br the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience br br i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if you're bored and nothing else br br 4 10
<START> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom br br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the list br br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
