<START> ok i'll be honest when i first saw the trailer for the programme i thought it was an advert for some sun screen product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at but i was seriously amazed br br from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc etc br br it's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence humour action and suspense but 'lost' manages all of this with a great cast and crew beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects 'lost' will catch anyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone who's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv br br lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 uk 4 8 15 16 23 42 o
<START> grand epic as it is kenneth branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric and he sends himself up so well and his many flourishes thus hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip br br from patrick doyle's music to alex thomson's cinematography to tim harvey's exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing his adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of hamlet the strain seemed to be showing yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role derek jacobi gobbles up the sinister claudius with glee and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen gertrude richard briers is marvellous as polonius and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king many others drop by including jack lemmon superb in a very small role billy crystal dame judi dench sir john mills sir john gielgud sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu the acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years kate winslet hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair ophelia br br to finish before this review goes on longer than the film i must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes too many of them outstay their welcome watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it neither a lender nor a borrower be or be true to thyself and of course to be or not to be br br the opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward br br monday june 8 1998 hoyts croydon
<START> the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker generally female garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional the oppressed workers who are given a voice and of course the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans br br the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like 0 10 per hour to do so you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor br br i have wondered where those necklaces came from not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world honorable mention goes to wal mart it is simply amazing and clearly just the tip of the iceberg
<START> generally i've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd there's probably a good reason for it i hadn't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured i'd give this one a shot br br it's really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the singles ward or the r m if you're into those type movies you'll probably enjoy this br br however if you're not a mormon this movie probably won't appeal to you there's no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you don't fall within the mormon demographic you're probably better off watching something else br br admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
<START> a nightmare on elm street the dream child br br this is a bad movie there's no escaping it i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies but even being a fan i can't help but see this movie is mediocre br br there's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters by now they had just given up they don't even try they are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollars br br the story doesn't grab your attention its so simple it's almost absent br br alice a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother and that's it br br the story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting in fact that's the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br the characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them br br the girls are as unattractive as possible the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group i've seen better actors in school plays it's embarrassing really br br lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this she is beautiful sexy and has some talent but the material just didn't let her shine what a pity br br stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlinÂ´s brilliant direction in dream master he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found br br the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel it's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br the end for the once scary freddy it's too sad to see him now a clown that's not funny a bad joke goodbye freddy
<START> a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore which leaves him hideously disfigured five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion of course an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors writers directors mark ezra peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichÃ©s which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun fake jump scares prowling steadican shots a fierce storm an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity a totally ridiculous what the hell supernatural climax tacky make up f x and one of those lovably lame it was all just a terrible dream fake out non endings moreover the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer a lady taking an acid bath a guy being crushed under a huge tractor and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick the cast all give solid performances with especially stand out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank and donna yeager as foul mouthed slut stella co producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny harry manfredini's moody rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his friday the 13th scores alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick good trashy fun
<START> somerset maugham's characters are brought to life in rko's of human bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with bette davis' star making performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise it's the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr howard's struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the film br br along the way right away in this version howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis as mildred rogers davis' characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted br br still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a write in campaign for the 1934 best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were br br 1 claudette colbert it happened one night br br 2 norma shearer the barretts of wimpole street br br 3 bette davis of human bondage br br 4 grace moore one night of love br br of human bondage 6 28 34 john cromwell leslie howard bette davis reginald denny
<START> i recently found this movie on vhs after looking for it for a number of years i was not disappointed it gets better every time i see it peter ustinov stars and co wrote the original screenplay nominated for an academy award other stars you've heard of include karl malden bob newhart and cesar romero ustinov plays an accountant embezzler just released from england's infamous wormwood scrubs prison he had embezzled from the conservative party headquarters selected because he is a liberal he immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle and discovers that computers are the wave of the future he social engineers his way into a london men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town he steals the identity of one caesar smith who has just left town for south america to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild he talks his way into ta can co an american conglomerate headed by carlton klemper karl malden klemper hires smith and shows him around the computer center especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells him disconnect blue light using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies the scheme starts to unravel when klemper's assistant willard g gnatpole bob newhart notices the amount of business ta can co appears to be transacting with ustinov's scam companies with the help of his secretary patty terwilliger maggie smith ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after to tell you how would spoil this very funny romantic intelligent and ahead of its time picture
<START> it is a good film for kids who love dogs it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil the basic plot is the same as the first movie the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog the bird talks like a human eric idle of monty python and barks like a dog it is the comedy that the film needed more of see it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney
<START> steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse br br this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clichÃ© 'evil english villain' that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days br br suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to br br in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse br br save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagal's most ardent fan
<START> batman mystery of the batwoman is in a word stale br br the plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante batwoman is intruding on batman's turf and while batman is trying to combat a penguin bane rupert thorne threesome he's trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is br br there is nothing strikingly wrong about this but there is nothing really special about it either noting really made it stick out br br mask of the phantasm had bruce's long lost love re surface and mess with his head br br subzero was a major event in the life of mr freeze br br even the batman beyond movie spin off return of the joker dug deep with the characters involved br br but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat frankly this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in it's prime
