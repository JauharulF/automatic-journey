<START> this film aka the four hundred blows is a mistranslation faire les 400 coups means to live a wild life as a french i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good but by no means outstanding film 1 it's not the first film of the nouvelle vague move check agnes varda's la pointe courte 1956 alain resnais's hiroshima mon amour 1958 claude chabrol's le beau serge 1958 are anterior historically les 400 coups comes after 2 the nouvelle vague was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors overnight julien duvivier henri george clouzot claude autant lara yves allÃ©gret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion this selfishness and this contempt is typically nouvelle vague you 've never heard or read the great generation of the thirties renoir carnÃ© grÃ©millon duvivier already feyder laugh at say maurice tourneur or max linder so thanks to truffaut and co some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties duvuvier's sous le ciel de paris autant lara's douce yves allÃ©gret's une si jolie petite plage and manÃ¨ges the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless 3 les 400 coups is technically rather disappointing it's very academic the story is as linear as it can be the teachers are caricatures and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is well your father 's got only his brevet junior school diploma and as for me i've got only my high school diploma you've got to know that circa 1960 hardly 10 of the pupils had the hsd in france antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all she wants him to have diplomas who can blame her 4 compared to the innovations of hiroshima mon amour which features a brand new form and a new fragmented content les 400 coups pales into significance truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior jules and jim helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau 5 the interpretation is rather stiff jean pierre lÃ©aud arguably listenable when dubbed in english is still decent but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation 6 the topic stolen childhood had better days before julien duvivier's poil de carotte luis bunuel's los olvidados and will have after maurice pialat's l'enfance nue kenneth loach's kes i do not want to demean truffaut his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer jules and jim l'enfant sauvage a film honest true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault l'argent de poche as academic as 400 coups but much more funny or his nice hitchcock pastiche vivement dimanche br br
<START> new york playwright michael caine as sidney bruhl is 46 years old and fading fast as the film opens mr caine's latest play flops on broadway tv reviewers poke fun at caine and he gets drunk passing out on the long island railroad lands caine in montauk instead of his residence in east hampton finally arriving home caine is comforted by tightly attired wife dyan cannon as myra an unfortunately high strung heart patient there caine and ms cannon discuss a new play called deathtrap written by hunky young christopher reeve as clifford cliff anderson one of caine's former students the couple believe mr reeve's deathtrap is the hit needed to revive caine's career br br the trap is setÂ for a wickedly funny who'll do it br br directed by sidney lumet ira levin's long running broadway hit doesn't stray too far from its stage origin the cast is enjoyable and the story's twists are still engrossing one thing that did not work for me was the curtain call ending surely it played better on stage deathtrap is a fun film to watch again the performances are dead on but in hindsight the greeting reeve gives caine at the east hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling hello the location isn't really east hampton but the windmill and pond look similar and the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid but the play was so good even a gifted director couldn't ruin it and mr lumet doesn't disappoint br br deathtrap 3 19 82 sidney lumet michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon irene worth
<START> as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s br br fastward to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at http www johntopping com harvey 20perr war 20widow war widow html
<START> perhaps it's me and my perverted ways or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise i enjoyed it br br yes i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer i was clearly deceived after seeing well everything to cut a long story short i can see why it was banned not only for such explicit sex scenes but for beastiality br br of course as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast a personal favorite of mine it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever the hell that thing was like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation of course the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods br br but that's not all oh there is so much more br br not only do we get to see interspecial sex but there's also humping horses the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her er satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals br br creative and enjoyable but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed i was 15 words of advice when watching this film make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed it may be fun but i doubt there are other porn films like this one
<START> purple rain what else can i say the title speaks for itself but i think all the actors were well picked the movie had a great story i loved it ever since i watched that movie i've been stuck in the eighties and i'm only 13 my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance murphy brown also did a great job in the movie he actually acted like himself i'm so glad i've seen this movie the song purple rain beautifully sung was so heartfelt i cried more than once
<START> like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst i've seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilers br br i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra to spend on cgi i've seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers and or technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being br br this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel br br two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors' performances aren't half bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a career move but i guess we all have bills to pay br br to those of you who gave this movie top score you have to be on the studio's payroll or something that's my only explanation br br to all who haven't seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some
<START> i figured that it's about time i let this one out pokÃ©mon fans are suffering in america these days why because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now i have seen all three pokÃ©mon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing pokÃ©mon 2000 in theaters i can't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb extreme sarcasm there and created this crap br br possible spoilers from here on br br well i guess i should first talk about pikachu's rescue adventure my first gripe with this came with no narration i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokÃ©dex narration that plagued pikachu's vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration all together this wouldn't have been a problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn't let togepi go until the end possibly the fans but i'm sure not the parents then there's the theme song i couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou' and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana nice music fun to watch that's changed with the bellossom the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the pokÃ©mon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary oh and then there's the poliwhirl who thinks he's a poliwrath you'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but i haven't touched on the worst of it yet br br you'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power for some unfathomable reason i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb my thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well ' that in mind i just didn't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said you will believe that one person can make all the difference ' with the way they said that at every turn i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version then comes nintendo power in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature 'the power of one ' at that point i became a bit more uneasy the power of one ' not a good sign however i still kept some of my false faith big mistake br br sitting in the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle i can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing repeating it over and over like in msb however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash ' ah hah so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokÃ©mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony this time he's the chosen one a greater way that this did damage was to lugia lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokÃ©mon movie when the movie was about lugia in this one lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash in the scene where they're flying back to the main island lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia's existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasn't really the one person' that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way br br a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card ' ugh even worse misty's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held why didn't you put them in pokÃ©balls when you caught them this is like caging them to be displayed ' much different from whining about him thinking pokÃ©mon are things to be collected like stamps if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american pokÃ©mon movie i'm going to see i've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two i'll be importing the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and 4kids you have forsaken me for the last time
<START> this is cult stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry i've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing if you enjoyed morons from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the worlds i love the red neck rampage to get the aliens the bug on the hood the dod the heat seeking populous annihilator the mine field the red camo breaking the speed limit by 1800mph i'll get the bucket very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd forget the negative reviews see it for yourself
<START> that might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true just have a look at what he as done so far they barely make it past the 3 star mark br br why did i watch this movie 2 reasons lucy lawless and heroes star greg grunberg lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie i do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills greg was not so impressive typical tv acting style br br the movie is oddly categorized as a horror the only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2 5 seconds with a little blood in them i personally would call this more a drama thriller br br but no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting appart from lucy destroys it you get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one you just sit there watching feeling nothing its like watching a bad tv soap actually i think the tv soap would be more interesting br br my advice stay away from this movie or better yet just stay away from anything michael hurst is involved with
<START> i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie this is a totally sucked movie i mean sucked s u c k e d the story development is strange mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all in addition all the actresses looked way too old for being college students college students looked like about 30 years old you figure out the rest i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes all the sex scenes are lame hasty and most importantly no frontal at all all the sex scenes are laughable considering how many clothes they had on do yourself a favor put it down and save yourself a few bucks conclusion story 0 sex 0 acting 0 score 0 out 10
<START> some films manage to survive almost on originality alone wonderland is certainly one of those films the script manages to throw everything into a near fever pitch but without making it incoherent the speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script but rather to accurately reflect the drug addled reality br br as director james cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors most of the characters are perpetually on edge and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities val kilmer has described john holmes to be a hustler able to manipulate and control no offense to kilmer but his version of holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak minded nonetheless it's a stunning performance comparing this to kilmer's more 'hollywood' roles like in the saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks br br the actors are the main force holding all together there are various little performances that stand out especially the women carrie fisher kate bosworth and lisa kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts but they are all fantastic aside from kilmer ted levine and dylan mcdermott give a weird stunning energy to their roles br br i originally put off watching wonderland because i assumed it was a film about a porn actor in the strictest sense yes the story revolves around john holmes but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career basically this film is a murder mystery and as such it's excellent br br rating 7 5 out of 10
<START> myself and my groovadelic 20 something pals just can't get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but can't seem to find it too bad as i'm sure the features would be extra special we all highly recommend this uber cool comedy flickerino for a date or even just a cozy night home alone this would also be the purr fect type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable huggable squeezable parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense you've just been outdone by a way radder movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesn't get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie macdougall aka dj cyber rap
