<START> all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison there s also a storyline involving a murder br br i will be honest and confess that i wasn t too taken by the movie since i m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it s got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent br br i ll be very surprised if this movie doesn t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they re doing

<START> a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four br br the plot is a simple one but works very effectively the blurring between child like fantasy and hard hitting nightmare is very well blurred the budget looks pretty low but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often it also hasn't dated that much either br br i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago and it has withstood half a dozen viewings it's one of those films that won't appeal to all though as usual those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this br br charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene cross is also very good carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture br br there are some genuinely and i don't say that lightly disturbing moments in this film both half second shockers and more drawn out tensions watch it with the lights out br br highly recommended br br 9 10 br br
<START> wasn't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn't disappoint br br for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent which made me feel better about mine which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie br br the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope br br however the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible br br on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections they only last 5 minutes anyway br br ca vaut la peine
<START> spoilers powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it until like in the case of bull like gypo noland victor mclaglen it's too much too late br br it's 1922 and the hight of the black tan irish revolt against the mighty british empire with the tans british occupying troops on the lookout for wanted irish republican rebel frankie mcphillip wallace ford wanted for the killing of a briish soldier gypo a good really the best friend of the fugitive mcphillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend katie margot grahame forced to turn tricks in the dublin red light district in order to pay her rent br br after an outraged gypo worked over a potential john who want's to spend a few hours with katie for a shilling or two an angry katie tells the not so bright gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has her body katie also tells gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in telling the mind numbed gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to america and get out of the poverty of ireland gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend frankie mcphillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling thats enough money for both him and kaite to travel to america br br gypo going to a local dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend frankie mcphillip frankie tells him that he snuck into dublin to see both his mother mrs mcphillip and sister mary una o'connor heather angel and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his irish republican unit outside the city br br all gypo can see in frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police without as much of a second thought after he assured frankie that everything is all right gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and tan shootout in his moms house br br with the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling much like thirty pieces of silver to an almost emotionless gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him you can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for gypo's betrayal of his friend frankie mcphillip even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the british empire that's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for br br gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind gypo sees and hears everyone including his unsuspecting girlfriend katie pointing a finger and implicating him in frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the british authorities gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk on the reward money that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his irish republican army colleagues who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering gypo on trial the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring br br whatever good feelings if that's possible that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation in order to keep from getting shot he falsely implicate an innocent man mulligan donald meek in his crime of informing on his friend frankie mcphillip which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt ridden gypo himself the dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable crime punishment classic
<START> ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces i found only the egyptian one disappointing stragely all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 11 the afghan refugees deaf people palestinians the widows of srebrenica aids and poverty and corruption in africa pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath suicide bombings in israel paranoia hit and state persecuted muslim americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while they effectively do the same with their short films br br surprising myself i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection and spoiler ahead i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc collapsed out of light's way i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it
<START> comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant but we weren't to notice and when colby was a f g triple agent but now in tonight's episode david is trapped with a paranoid nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun in an elevator and he can't disarm him a trained experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand to hand fighting can't take out a nut job not when said nut job blinks looks away drops his head closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds br br then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick love interest amita my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged don gives david the distress word that is the code for the s t is about to go down david is ready they kill the lights drop the elevator startle the nut job and br br david cannot disarm kill beat into submission the nut job the bad guy ends up with both guns david ends up shot br br i'm done hope the numb3rs are fun
<START> i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured claudio cassinelli an actor i like i was certainly disappointed br br the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with rollerball logan's run blade runner and the new film death race which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason statham br br this was just a bore for the most part the kill bike action was ridiculous the training was a snooze fest it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including dallas star jared martin or fred williamson br br pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off
<START> spoilers careful br br what can i say i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy i love it and have watched it countless times and usually find out something new about it with each viewing br br i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people not rich people who live in either l a or new york well it is true except for pam br br travolta plays bud a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys good guys in big budget movies this is a really good movie the mechanical bull riding contest and two step dancing may be silly but you have to enjoy this for what it is br br bud meets sissy played by debra winger with slutty brilliance and soon after they are married and living in their dream trailer but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes bud wants to be a real cowboy sissy wants to be with a real cowboy but in modern times men's roles are not as clear where can bud prove he's a real man he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night he can be a urban cowboy but sissy wants to drive his pick up truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too so where does this leave bud as sissy asserts her independence she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex con and prison rodeo star a real bull rider wes played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn bud is threatened and bud and sissy break up br br sissy shacks up with wes who abuses her emasculating himself further bud becomes the boy toy of pam a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up pam doesn't do that kind of thing she writes a make up letter to bud but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy's housework br br bud's uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation but are too stubborn later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley's and you know bud is going to win pam realizes that bud doesn't love her but sissy he did it for her wes tries to rob gilleys but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy bud saves the day and wins back the woman he loves br br of course you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and live like pigs maybe that contributed to their bad marriage or why didn't bud stay with pam she wasn't that bad and had money or why they had to kill off uncle bob or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up marshall says to bud she sissy rides that bull better than you do but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit and saying isn't that bonnie raitt on the stage
<START> you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i'll take a stab at one now br br episode 'valentines pay' br br jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing wages she realizes 'her' mistake and the usual 'oh jim you're so lovely' the end br br another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk br br imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of human beings with tvs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you'd get an audience br br 'two and a half men' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious
<START> obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence ' directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarter br br at an italian resort in the 1920's alexander luzhin john turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament that man is valentinov stuart wilson luzhin's former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin br br valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati fabio sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort natalia emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life br br to tell luzhin's story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling br br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesn't happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true to life he captures luzhin's genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real it's a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rush's portrayal of david helfgott in shine ' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes' to pete in o brother where art thou ' to al fountain in box of moonlight ' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is br br as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor br br the supporting cast includes geraldine james vera christopher thompson stassard peter blythe ilya orla brady anna mark tandy luzhin's father kelly hunter luzhin's mother alexander hunting young luzhin and luigi petrucci santucci well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man we don't need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one 9 10 br br br br br br
<START> the eternal jew der ewige jude does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the film's logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as light skinned europeans thereby the text admits that so called hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach infested filth despite the supposed treasure they've hoarded and then flip flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldn't the use of scenes from a well known american film house of rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic first the film is denounced as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the rothschild character's spin is that jews are taxed excessively finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching for all of eternal jew's imperfections i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date i'd say the reason is that ej's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the film's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandist's tool about this time i should expect director hippler to flip flop once again springing forward to say that's what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate
