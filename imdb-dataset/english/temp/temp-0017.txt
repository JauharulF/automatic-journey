<START> considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
<START> don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it's ambivalent about the japanese whaling industry which morally is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish haggis cull it stinks cos it's pretentious tosh the sort of up its own behind guff that gets modern art a bad name that said there are some stunning images but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted and then just when you thinks it's finished it starts again i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show barney's film works which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty old men in macs brigade but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard stroking bjork fans were to be honest everyone might have had a lot more fun if they'd just shown one of the pornoes
<START> after you've seen this small likable and comical film you will for sure feel better cheer to yves b pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment that according to me will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the quebec the actors isabelle blais emmanuel bilodeau sylvie moreau and stÃ©phane gagnon all deliver a touching performance i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'amÃ©lie poulain have given me so if you've like the jean pierre jeunet magnificent film i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b pelletier les aimants
<START> the first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with which is exactly what a young latino girl does in girlfight ' written and directed by karyn kusama diana michelle rodriguez is an eighteen year old high school senior from the projects in brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester she affects a whatever' attitude which masks a deep seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go she lives with her father sandro paul calderon with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother tiny ray santiago with her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her and one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where tiny trains ironically tiny wants nothing to do with boxing he wants to go to art school but sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons when diana convinces tiny's trainer hector jaime tirelli to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money ultimately with tiny's help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home it's an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better and the fact that she will have to fight men not women in gender blind' competitions does not faze her in the least diana has found her element br br first time writer director karyn kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere and there's no candy coating on it either as hector tells diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is i was a fighter once i lost ' then looking around the busy gym like most of these guys they're going to lose too but it's all they know ' and it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is it's a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run down gym you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know br br making her screen debut michelle rodriguez is perfectly cast as diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves she is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really rodriguez exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin whatever it is it works it's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation she certainly makes diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out br br as positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note though diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of hector after all realistically and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women and in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate br br the supporting cast includes santiago douglas adrian elisa bocanegra marisol alicia ashley ricki and thomas barbour ira though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of girlfight ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring that aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience i rate this one 7 10 br br br br
<START> for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be there was no doubt about it being funny and bad because i had seen voyna i mir 1968 shall we begin here we go br br robert dornhelm brendan donnison's pierre bezukhov a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original robert dornhelm brendan donnison's natasha rostova a scarecrow her image can cause insomnia robert dornhelm brendan donnison's andrej bolkonsky an ok incarnation which like the lean fellow cf above lacks depth of a russian soul and struggle within robert dornhelm brendan donnison's napoleon a rather unimpressive leader robert dornhelm brendan donnison's prince bolkonsky a turd with an english face robert dornhelm brendan donnison's count bezukhov a spineless freak show br br the rest of the characters are not much better br br the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious they behave like modern eu citizens dressed up for a one day masquerade it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early 19th century br br a good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of we had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product which had been shown the previous evening on our tv br br user rating 8 0 10 29 votes i guess many young people have never watched our film voyna i mir 1968 or have weird sense of tarantino spielberg quality remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend turns around shoots and the bridge goes boom looks like a cgi explosion br br there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel which was screened properly in our country once but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of gone with the wind hey directors wake up and get busy with that instead of spoiling our classics br br now back to common sense jokes aside what i mentioned above is nothing new though deadly exaggerated br br to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians while participating in very serious epics and dramas is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again of course it results in numerous laughs especially clemence poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think this sucks so much that it's funny br br in order to say something new i'd like to mention the pace of the movie to my mind this new version is very patchy the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing they stagger and pop up like in a modern video again i have to remember our voyna i mir where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy going with the flow br br i thought that maybe the borodino battle would be great to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968 br br there should be something good in this movie after all and there is the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined the losers' team plus 1 point for that recklessness it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best it all evokes pity and sometimes fits of laughter br br what i still like about this serial is the last part of it it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her salary and taxes besides judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene which would definitely kill the whole project but fortunately it does not have such rubbish and that's a big plus br br voyna i mir is no harry potter and nowadays even we here in present day russia do not have enough craft to film it properly do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely fortunately a proper film was screened during our soviet times the american version of the 1950s was justified to some extent ours did not even exist yet there were extenuating circumstances then br br 4 out of 10 1 point is given from the start 1 point goes for the recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the serial thanks for attention
<START> my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it br br this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it weren't for mystery science theater i wouldn't be here today p
<START> in spite of the great future design touches the clever asimov premise and will smith's dependable cool performance this movie doesn't live up to expectations the clichÃ©s come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject 'nanites' you know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but it's less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years

<START> the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation a woman and the senate read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it won't come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
