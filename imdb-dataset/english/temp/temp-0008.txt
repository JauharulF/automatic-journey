<START> typical de palma movie made with lot's of style and some scene's that will bring you to the edge of your seat br br most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller is the style it has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat the best scene's from the movie the museum scene and the elevator murder there are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie so this movie might not be suitable for everybody br br the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie br br there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking not bad for a 49 year old br br the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well just like his score for the other de palma movie body double br br brilliant nerve wrecking thriller i love de palma br br 10 10

<START> and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom anais nin marcel proust says the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the u s navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes based on his autobiography finding fish written many years after the events his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher denzel washington's first directorial effort it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time br br required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone derek luke recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport denzel washington he is at first unwilling to talk but when he begins the floodgates are opened after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years suffering humiliation and sexual abuse according to antwone the treatment by his foster mother mrs tate novella nelson who referred to him only as nigga and by his cousin nadine yolonda ross was in fact much worse than shown on the screen br br the only friend he has is a local by named jesse jascha washington who later in the film only adds to his feelings of abandonment it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke though the film's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile davenport's humanity and warmth however allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl joy bryant his new girlfriend who is also in the navy supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough br br with cheryl's help and dr davenport's counseling antwone develops enough self esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past what comes through in derek luke's incredible performance is antwone's longing for acceptance dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him comedian mort sahl once said that people just have to remember what we're all here for to find our way home antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep not knowing the joy of being loved
<START> erendira is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about the film only exists in a low quality vhs format it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release erendira is stunning and gorgeous with its magic realist images erendira is based on a short story from the novel 100 years of solitude erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house her evil grandma played by irene papas forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages the whole town gets a piece of erendira so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesn't exploit sexuality it's done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center erendira is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as they'd say in espanol es muy muy bien excellente
<START> first off i'm not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well done impressively well done at that he actually looks kind of other worldly like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a attending to nature's call spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down that or he's the caucasian brother of the wishmaster i haven't decided which br br actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and vistas say canada to me and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china it's a sci fi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location br br further apparently as we have just established sci fi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said it's a sci fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things br br the movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between alive about the donner party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman or super mario remember run faster jump higher live longer br br also the yeti has missed his teddy bear he's searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a cadaver work poor yeti you can't help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss he's missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is banished do ya hear me well it does seem to be an unmated male rebanished br br and it's superhuman well it's not human it's super yeti but then again what's normal yeti i don't know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous dahlink it's spotlessly white at times when it so shouldn't be he's fastidiously superhu super yeti br br all in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly gravel like production style this is actually quite entertaining i can't help wondering if they're planning on another one br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the m4tv scale br br it rates a 4 4 10 on the movie scale from br br the fiend
<START> sugar spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out but this pg 13 trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some t a that would've have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
<START> i really think i should make my case and have every horror and or cult movie buff go and see this movie br br i did br br it is excellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scary br br incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low read no budget they had br br synopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse br br on this website imdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out br br www softfordigging com
<START> when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate br br his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china's devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930's br br he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child br br his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man br br there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye br br the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended 9 10 stars
<START> waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap 02 out of 10
<START> movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other 10 minus 8 1 2 equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two br br movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other 10 minus 8 1 2 equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two
<START> once in a while a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come a chinese ghost story' falls in this category it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's possibly one of the best ever made br br the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan the story is engrossing and original the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening the sets are creepy and atmospheric there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house but don't let the horror' label scare you off if you're not a fan of the genre this film easily fits into many different categories br br the screenwriter has deftly blended the drama comedy horror kung fu and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza a chinese ghost story' is a beautiful epic love story told thankfully without the gratuitous nudity and or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood love stories' those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast paced swordplay and wire fu' if that's not enough actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy this film offers something for every film fan br br director siu tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian i cannot possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed ling choi sin better except maybe chow yun fat joey wang is enchanting as lit su seen the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of cheung's character her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable wu ma is hilarious as the cantankerous taoist who aids the young lovers br br on technical level this film is very impressive even by today's standards the direction is superb i wish that today's hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like siu tung ching rather falling back on the usual mtv video or pepsi commercial directors' the cinematography is gorgeous you have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night the special effects make up is top notch in fact most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films br br since its release a chinese ghost story has spawned two worthy sequels a full length animated movie and countless imitations none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic however this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time 10 out 10 br br
