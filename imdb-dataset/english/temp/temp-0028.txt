<START> spoilers herein br br my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than australian kickboxing's favorite son stan the man longinidis the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia's greatest kick boxer he said that he wasn't a sell out he was happy and a retiree he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxingÂ then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called trojan warrior this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight for now br br stan plays ajax a kick boxing ex special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne ajax's cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didn't stray too far away from everything to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party it's all pretty ridiculous but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again br br i'll admit i was actually pumped to see this i love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect stan's actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities remember those plot holes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now that's a marriage br br amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as Âa cross between jackie chan guy ritchieÂ has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doingÂ well anything and guy ritchie is the crime film messiah and you're comparing him to salik silverstein this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja br br now where do you thing the whole trojan warrior title comes from ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the gangsters' unification to find theo like that of the trojan empire no it's becauseÂ wait for itÂ theo carries a condom around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket he is a trojan warrior br br i had the displeasure of seeing trojan warrior on dvd as well as it's special features br br Â video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark chopper read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together br br Â bloopers there was no real difference between these and the actual film br br Â stan the man longinidis kickboxing featurette this wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage br br i don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of trojan warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad
<START> this movie was on t v the other day and i didn't enjoy it at all the first george of the jungle was a good comedy but the sequel completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all they should of had the original actor brendon fraiser and original actress i forgot her name so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought it was good to see ape the ape back but wasn't as fun as the first they should of had the new george as georges son grown up and still had bredon and whats her face in the film that would've been a bit better then it was
<START> there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the business br br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you don't notice king vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving thalberg br br it's about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs br br please even if you're not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can it's really a terrific trip back in time
<START> this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values the movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie besides this it is flawless
<START> i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not i'm glad i gave it a chance br br bait ain't perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film br br most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell he's working on instinct and instinct doesn't fail him br br the plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person again they could've slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better br br i'm surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but i'd give it a 7 10 bravo mssr foxx

<START> this movie is bad if you are thinking about watching it there is only one decent scene in the movie and it lasts about 5 seconds amanda carraway's topless scene the rest of the movie is horrible i think high school plays probably have better acting the plot makes no sense at all the set was pretty lame and it wasn't even good to make fun of it was just dull and very very bad i watched this on starz so i thought it had to be at least decent the mini description sounded like it'd be alright the girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie after you have to watch some horrible music video the transitions between scenes are very abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them just cuts from one scene to another no smoothness kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is to explaining why the plot sucks the audio gets low at some points where you can barely hear it then gets loud with gay 'horror screams' thrown in at random points in the movie it is the same sound every time this is now officially the worst movie i have ever seen br br acting 0 10 effects 1 10 storyline 0 10 music 3 10 br br lame meter 1 000 000 10
<START> mardi gras made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and globalization through the making and tossing of beads i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eye opening film is humorous in depth serious non patronizing and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to murderball it's simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the revelers during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides in depth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between beads china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of globalization inequality and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on globalization that i've seen
<START> good exciting movie although it looks to me that it's not been recorded on location in thailand it still looks realistic nice story about some girls having 'fun' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world in real the thai people are very kind
<START> kalifornia is one of my all time favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90 s the film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others one of the film s strongest aspects is it s performances brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer trash psycho named early pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heart breaking kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality there are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a power house climax that will haunt you for days kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for it s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for it s violence and gore
