<START> the problems with nikhil advani's salaam e ishq are many a one line concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier english film love actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing a well intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition a director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film kal ho na ho try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick the problem is what worked fabulously in kal ho na ho were the emotional excesses of the karan johar school of film making but here 'emotion' doesn't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen no not even cursorily the writer director gives us 'six relationships with one common problem love' but where is the intensity where is the depth where is the 'emotion' a 'tribute to love' sans emotion and one that goes on and on and on nah it just cannot work br br in my opinion the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be 'complete' it should in some way or the other follow the graph of the traditional three act structure screen writing guru syd field's paradigm that's the real reason why salaam e ishq didn't work for me none of the stories had any depth or a roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream hindi cinema also the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced it's not clear what salman khan is doing at ayesha takia's wedding if he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap up why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding that would be neater br br but yes some of the stories did have a lot of promise for one the anil kapoor juhee chawla story tries to address a very real situation mid life crisis but its journey is so linear that you're left wondering if it was really an issue similarly the problem of commitment in the akshaye khanna ayesha takia story is also true to life if only it was developed a little better i felt that the more promising stories in this mish mash were told from the male point of view which is fine but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters juhee chawla and ayesh takia in particular have all the depth of a half filled bath tub wasn't this film supposed to be about '12 different lives' now the actors john abraham still needs to learn acting while vidya balan is dependable and endearing as ever anil kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character since she didn't get a meaty character to portray juhee chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it akshaye khanna is fine despite going a trifle over the top in a few scenes ayesha takia has nothing much to do but she does remind us that she's the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in dor govinda tries to make up for that huge mistake called bhagam bhag and succeeds to a large extent br br that brings me the most irritating track of the film which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time salman khan and priyanka chopra the track is irritating mainly because of them but i must credit them for their consistency they're consistently bad all through the film priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming i don't buy the crap that her role that of an 'item girl' required her to act over the top somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming if you've seen rakhi sawant who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and bigg boss you'll know what i mean i strongly feel that if nikhil advani had taken rakhi sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like priyanka the story would have worked better salman khan's phony accent is well shannon esra's hindi is less accented than salman's br br to be fair to the director he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film i particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the anil kapoor juhee chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman but will anyone choose to paint their house in varying depressing shades of grey that's acceptable cinematic license i would say but when the film runs almost for 4 hours it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his 'touch' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences br br maybe nikhil advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible pata nahin kal ho na ho
<START> bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940's and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones br br bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards br br you have got almost everything in this movie the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf her sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela's house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie br br the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should i could let this slide it is after all a movie however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in nebraska i live in nebraska i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on first of all the small town that is talked about as the setting is the third largest city in the state with a population of around 50 000 grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver second the scenery for the movie is wrong grand island is in the platte river valley which is very flat with very few trees i tried watching this movie but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad this was a real event large sections of the city were wiped out in the book they talk about riding bikes from mormon island to fonner park i guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here http www theindependent com twisters
<START> without question this film has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history i have it watched too many times to remember and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time br br where does one begin br br meena kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar each movement and nuance of her performance makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen br br pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition the photography sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left breathless br br naushads music is unsurpassed his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable br br my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should watch this epic mediation on life and art
<START> as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed we all made over 100 a day when 20 40 a day was much closer to reality when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work and offered me work i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the 100 000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years and kept most in the bank and still left myself 10 20000 for nl 1 2 and 2 5 cash games at the casinos i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll instead i win about 1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke sometimes i had over 1000 2000 in my sock while i slept outside anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger i admit i was different than most homeless people though due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs im no longer homeless am now in govt housing for 177 a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping worrying about getting caught by security are finally over had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner its a shame how they don't better select who they pick
<START> whoever wrote the nice post about this must have been a friend of these guys this is bad even for backyard wrestling in fact this isn't even backyard wrestling really it's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this it is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name if that is possible if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain it stars the 2 biggest names in byw mdogg20 and josh prohibition these guys are good they have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as real pro wrestlers they went legit and have gotten better i recommend checking out those 2 guys mdogg is insane and off the hook so don't waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd there are better back yard videos out there
<START> in the early 1970s many of us who had embraced hippy acid alternative culture wholeheartedly had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would for me this film defined the tension of now what that many of the people i knew felt at that time do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change br br from the futile gestures to police the radical rhetoric the music of pink floyd to the love making and the explosive images in the desert so much is in there it captures well a significant moment in time
<START> near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess' i really couldn't say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine clichÃ© jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic br br as a story on finding love it's not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula br br kate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes it's the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year's what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepard br br it's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn't necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade a hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but i simply didn't care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any wayÂ so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair i'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> i saw this movie during a tolkien themed interim class during my sophomore year of college i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy everyone else was laughing but they weren't within constant eyesight br br let's get it out of the way the peter jackson 'lord of the rings' films do owe something to the bakshi film in jackson's version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi's film shot by shot you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda br br i'm sure the similarities don't stop there i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film i'm sure others have outlined the similarities look around br br this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocrity br br due to heavy use of rotoscoping gandalf is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film br br saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman' during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason br br sam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying yes hobbits are small like children but they are not children br br merry and pippin are never introduced they simply appear during a scene change with a one sentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like this br br frodo sam pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back which was not visible before and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into la la la s awful br br aragorn apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants complete with huge square pilgrim belt buckle he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass br br the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frightening br br the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen in which they stare at frodo who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything else br br gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf he's a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome it's a crude but accurate description br br boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculous br br despite the similarity to tolkien's illustration the balrog is howl inducing and the least threatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and it's barely taller than gandalf purists may prefer this balrog but i'll take jackson's version any day br br the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments i'm not asking for action packed scenes like those in jackson's film but they are supposed to be fighting br br treebeard makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film you'll see what i mean br br alright now for the good parts of the film br br some of the voice acting is pretty good it isn't that aragorn sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant br br galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom bombadil she seems immune to the ring's powers of temptation and her voice actress isn't horrible either br br boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene but it's still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did br br as my professor pointed out between whispered threats the orcs mainly at helm's deep if i'm correct resemble the war ravaged corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted br br while this isn't really a positive point about the film bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so i've been told the project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher ups who i'm sure hadn't read the books br br let me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product br br overall i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters places and events i'm sure somebody somewhere will pick a copy of this up in confusion if you do keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it
<START> note i couldn't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just can't be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the movie br br things that i thought about while watching prom night br br i'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didn't the whole it's just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death br br the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichÃ©s on two hands not a good sign br br even after just meeting the protagonist's boyfriend i'm convinced he will die anybody want to place bets br br the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna br br high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn't keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasn't in place the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything i've already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and i'm only in the 20 minute mark how else will i entertain myself br br note to self don't forget milk and bread on the way home br br dear screenwriter you've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year br br the 1980 version of this film wasn't that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish she'd act more br br apparently at prom there isn't much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in br br the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes that's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just saying br br it's official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snow's unconvincing performance i'll have to say it was all of the above br br okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the pot br br finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasn't too smart that's the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience br br i can't wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review br br i can't recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isn't served br br rating out of
<START> as a another reviewer states hanna's war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person hanna anniko senesh who would become the jewish joan of arc unfortunately i diverge in opinion not agreeing that miss detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces maruschka detmers performance is brave poignant heartfelt or understood and totally believable in other words for me in the zone from the opening credits if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give hanna's war with maruschka detmers a try my hat is off also to ellen burstyn as hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film in that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress' but not an all about eve situation
<START> there are three movies with this animation style that i fondly remember from my youth this movie the last unicorn flight of dragons and the hobbit i own copies of both dragons and the hobbit both excellent and i hadn't seen the last unicorn in more than a decade that was until today and now i wish i hadn't what bothered me the most was the script it was incredibly choppy and often inane things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation we're not just talking about little things here either we're talking about key plot points the story itself isn't that great to begin with but it could have worked had the script been decent not even close on top of that the music was awful i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day but it just got cut i don't think i could ever sit through that crap fest again disappointed is putting it mildly
<START> a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie
