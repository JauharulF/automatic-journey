<START> i really felt cheated after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos it ends suddenly and you know there's going to be another episode next week it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didn't know the rest of the story they wanted to make a dahmer 2 after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods all of a sudden i hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail how about showing how he got there how about showing dahmer's trial how about showing some more detail i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place i actually found myself saying in disbelief that's it that's the end i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made to the filmmakers i'd like to say if you're going to do it do it right
<START> bela lugosi revels in his role as european horticulturalist sic dr lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia the good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows sedating them into a coma like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie br br the corpse vanishes 1942 wallace fox bela lugosi luana walters elizabeth russell
<START> it's a short movie from david lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the lynchian ingredients it's mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysteriousÂ br br about the setting itself it hasn't the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eeriness br br the plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she's there just because of her faultÂ we don't know what did happen or what will happen nextÂ it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good lynch movie must end br br it's a great short despite some amateurish acting the girls are professional actresses but i think their acting could have been better in this short

<START> what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 hrs to kill watch it you won't regret it it's too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him i still liked it the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
<START> me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty they were such a cute couple the ending was so sad love this movie although it is a little dirty it reminds of a british or irish version of prime if you liked this movie you should watch prime same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed don't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me umm if you like irish movies i would recommend circle of friends that movie is so good quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined lol
<START> this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying it's quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re runs br br most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads br br i haven't commented enough you've got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show br br the gnome was a nice character
<START> this is a very very early bugs bunny cartoon as a result the character is still in a transition period he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right in addition the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual elmer is some poor sap who buys bugs from a pet shop there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations in later films he messed with elmer yosimite sam and others because they started it they messed with the rabbit but in this film he is much more like daffy duck of the late 30s and early 40s a jerk who just loves irritating others a true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons while this isn't among the best bug bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years
<START> spoilers br br while the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time br br i have two complaints 1 it's too short and 2 the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 5 10

<START> ordinarily i really enjoy movies like chances are but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body played by robert downey jr he meets up with his wife cybill shepherd and friend ryan o'neal and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated but from there the film goes downhill there are several sex related scenes that turned me off completely especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now after that however the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible considering the circumstances of the plot i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end there was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher but ultimately the film is not great for a better similar film try heaven can wait decent but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half br br out of
<START> when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying first of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every clichÃ© possible you can guess not only the general plot but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there on the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most ostensible manner the actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that will use a limited set of acting skills the i am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is ours body posture while the bad guys have the i'm a bad one frowning and the you caught me look followed by the i'm good for nothing and i should be removed from society head banding this kind of also sums up the general development of each show true story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers don't give a s t about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you
