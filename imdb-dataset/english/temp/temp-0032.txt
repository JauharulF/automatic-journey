<START> after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock there's just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that he's finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his trainee replacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don't see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as 7even well maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt
<START> sort of family parody blending an officer and a gentleman heartbreak ridge full metal jacket and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now into a rather dull movie with some bright spots the gags are always there where you would expect them and damon wayans's lines are well predictable as i said unfortunately this movie never surprises you
<START> tony arzenta a sicilian hit man or professional killer decides to leave the business and his former employers do not agree in terms of content this highly enjoyable action movie doesn't have one in terms of sheer amusement it is funÂit is very melodramatic violent quite brutal the car chases are notable arzenta is an unpretentious yet very likable filmÂmuch better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label it comes from delon's rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the '70s it carefully uses delon's tough guy persona belonging to the gallery of bad ass thugs that he made in his youth br br i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick br br the score is very fine with a good introductory songÂmaking felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work where the musical art has an important part br br in tony arzenta big guns no way out the very appealing erika blanc 31 years in '73 appears as an unnamed hooker meanwhile arzenta's girlfriend sandra is played by carla gravina a starlet that practically left the movies after '75 br br arzenta is interestingly filmedÂan ambitious visual conception some expressionistic peculiar angles the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari the one who made also zorro the delon comedy needless to mention that these two films tony arzenta 1973 and zorro are very unlike the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie the second is a lighthearted comedy more kindred to a spoof though remarkably coherent and skilfully made duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss bang bang 1966 sons of satan the bloodstained butterfly Â¡viva la muerte tua tough guys 1974 safari express 1976 etc
<START> that's certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested and it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio given that 1 the feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie's release 2 the feud between the producer robert fryer and director michael sarne was also common knowledge 3 the cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhere br br and 4 the author gore vidal hated it practically from day one nevertheless that tagline just about sums it up raquel welch does br br give a decent performance as myra and she looks lovely besides john huston is very funny as buck loner the ex cowboy star who runs a phony acting academy mae west in her first screen appearance since 1943 naturally rewrote her part to suit herself and she is great as ''oversexed'' and that's putting it mildly ''talent agent'' leticia van allen still she must have wondered after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return how she ever ended up in this mess br br tom selleck in his film debut is one of her ''clients'' john carradine and jim backus as doctors also amble in briefly rex reed as myron farrah fawcett and roger herren as the victims of myra myron's sexual passion are neither here nor there the same goes for the script which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book but seems to head in at least three different directions at once although west's part was originally larger she was reduced to a cameo role by the time sarne was through with the editing and partly because of this she seems to be in a different movie apparently at some point the producers realized that mae was going to be the film's big draw and unable to replace most of her cut footage they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs both of which come out of nowhere the device sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making doesn't work at all by the time the movie concludes all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about not surprisingly just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way and it died at the box office a technically flawless dvd includes among other extras separate commentaries from both welch and sarne each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong no doubt it's home video re release was prompted by a 2001'' vanity fair'' piece which attempted in great detail to do the same thing true the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking but with sarne at the helm of what was obviously a ''troubled'' production it really never had a chance
<START> because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story without having to listen to banal dialogue and be finished in 10 minutes max come to think of it even 10 minutes is too much to waste on enid blyton meets struggling wanna be artists vomit
<START> chang cheh's shaolin temple might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast a veritable who's who of the shaw stable though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in the long gray line cheh's shaolin temple is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style br br the cultural correlation i am tempted to make is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo at the end of the film you too might be tempted to call out remember the shaolin temple
<START> especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed 1973 this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong too many people and nothing works the only people who can live in comfort are the rich it's set in new york in 2022 i think and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta br br i got to appreciate charlton heston's acting after seeing him in orson welles' touch of evil he was maybe is capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi heroic people here he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt taking rare food treats from the rich and being totally corrupt actively condoning evil br br the movie all seems to take place at night and sweat is dripping off everyone except in one of the rare air conditioned apartments even though i hadn't seen it before i knew the famous ending which will not here be revealed but the ending is certainly foreshadowed br br great scenes with edward g robinson going to the council made up of elderly jews with heavy accents so it seems where the truth is revealed and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out br br gritty pre star wars dystopian science fiction
<START> had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in between scenes normal ambient sounds are missing but given it was 1931 and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french films by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely such as in l'atalante from 1934 br br okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like a nice charming film all in all
<START> the incubus is a mix of the good an interesting murder mystery the bad a disconnected script a sloppy resolution badly made attack scenes and the weird strong incestuous overtones a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes was that character really meant to be so wacko not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be but not particularly successful either 1 2
<START> though i've yet to review the movie in about two years i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel br br disney i've got a little message for you if you don't have the original director and actors handy you're just looking to get your butt whooped br br in the sequel our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter melody my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang yes i understand that disney is big on sing and dance numbers but really that's what made eric my favorite prince he was calm collected and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun and he did not sing br br and then there's the villain oh how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world unfortunately that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister morgana nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby oh how cute the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident decides to kidnap a month old baby gag me br br other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her morgana was just very unorthodox the same plan as her sister the same minions who by the way did not scare anyone i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie and she laughed hysterically she had no purpose being in there i'd like to have seen mom be the villain i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there br br king triton held none of the respect he'd earned from me in the first movie and don't even get me started on scuttle sebastian and flounder triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie and in the second it's almost like he's lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects scuttle once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle hopper' yes i'll admit it i did call my fork a dingle hopper from time to time after that in this film scuttle's all but forgotten a supporting character even in the first he at least added something to the movie he was rich with a flavor the others didn't have and in the sequel they all but stripped it from him entirely sebastian was still the same but twice as worrisome as before disney don't do that don't even try to mess with our favorite crab or our favorite little fat fish who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children he's fat and he's bland and he looks like he's going to flat line any second br br the walrus and penguin were unneeded and after a while you just start to resent everyone especially melody who has no depth to her whatsoever br br and one of these days disney i'm kicking out of my life br br if i didn't love your originals so much
<START> sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lacking br br on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a season long reality drama dating show jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesn't just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancÃ© or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the women's actions the women are super competitive while they don't even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost br br not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women weren't there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses Â either low cut or short br br while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations br br so a reality dating show couldn't be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sex driven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someone's attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side br br another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i don't get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they don't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated br br michelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and we've only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show Â narrowly missing elimination Â and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminated br br it began with survivor and from there it just took off Â reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we weren't watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappings br br this begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds i'm not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each one br br episodes used for critique season premier and episode 2
<START> kolchak is sheer entertainment great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him simon oakland jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes erik estrada in legacy of terror phil silvers in horror in the heights antonio fargas in the zombie it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files darren rip simon rip ruth rip
