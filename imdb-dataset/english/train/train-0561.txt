<START> the worst and chock full of people who really ought to know better the cast have six oscars between them it's set in 'contemporary' africa it was made in 1979 and is about the slave trade it's appallingly scripted and acted michael caine peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus it's also ludicrously plotted you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone this is as bad as it gets
<START> i first came across 'my tutor friend' accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that i'd never watched any korean films before in my whole life so mtf was really the first korean film i've ever watched and what a delightful surprise i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which i've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience i thought there're quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious witty and original too br br i watched mtf the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprise comic effect on me kind of mitigated that has however by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly 'enemies' who're utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say ji hoon's sassy girlfriend br br the film is divided into two distinct parts the 1st part deals with the 'fight' between su wan and ji hoon and is more violent and faster in pace after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the in ji hoon's opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss br br just one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a 21 year old self proclaimed 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his 'cool' is just a little odd i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isn't really what his appearance seems btw kwong san woo ji hoon does have a sexy body and perfect figure br br mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time
<START> i like cheap perfume better it doesn't last as long ralph meeker's convict character lawson tells this to barbara stanwyck's helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w her husband in tijuana this line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfume loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen's attraction to lawson even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn't likely wash away with the tide
<START> it happened with assault on prescient 13 in 2005 it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's wargames why oh why oh why won't hollywood ever learn leave them alone they can't be remade they suck we all hate them br br those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with matthew broderick ally sheedy go rent buy it now the hardware may look dated the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down br br for those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8 floppy variety well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war br br never before has a nice game of chess seemed the better option
<START> well then i just watched an crap load of movies all with varying degrees of quality i wasn't too sure about which one i wanted to review first then it hit me like a sack a rats rodentz warn people about rodentz this monstrosity stars nobody and is painfully dull to sit through and it's about mutant rats killing people yeah real freaking' original food of the gods or willard anyone those were better than this and that doesn't say much br br possible spoiler okay here's the story inna laboratory the scientist and his plucky assistant are experimenting on rats and their laboratory is in a crappy neighborhood and crappy building and the plucky assistant's moronic friends show up drunk and everyone becomes food for the crazed rats and just about everybody dies and oh yeah there's one giant rat that looks crappy but it gets killed the end there all in once sentence spoiler you say ppfff i beg to differ the second we all realize that there's a giant rat we all know it's gonna die eventually end spoiler br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br well i watched it for free but for everyone else hmmm no there's nothing good here br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br um well the gore was decent very average cinematography br br cg rats not as bad as they could've been in some shots br br the bad br br and in other shots the cg rats were pathetically cheap looking look if your film has a low budget maybe you shouldn't rely on cg lesson to take to heart br br the acting is extremely poor br br the characters are beyond uninteresting we have a mish mash of clichÃ©s and none of them are even done that well br br booooooooooooring br br been done before plenty of times br br stupid story just stupid br br giant rat looks like fat man in poorly conceived bear costume that was kind of funny but not funny enough to give this film any worth br br retarded unrealistic and boring dialog br br all the college student rat chow people are drinking tequila from huge plastic milk jugs and yet they don't appear to be drunk for anything longer than a few seconds way to stick with continuity guys br br the ugly br br this film is bad simply terrible worse than you might imagine it's not even laughably bad like for instance scarecrow 2002 or house of the dead now those movies are crap you can enjoy even if they do make you stupider br br memorable scene br br the lame action movie ending complete with uninjured heroes and explosion because it didn't feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity but still sucked br br acting 2 10 story 1 10 atmosphere 2 10 cinematography 4 10 character development 0 10 special effects make up 4 10 nudity sexuality 1 10 i was tending to my son occasionally during the film so i may have missed it but was supposedly in there violence gore 4 10 dialogue 2 10 music 1 10 average for the time writing 1 10 direction 2 10 br br cheesiness 7 10 crappiness 9 10 br br overall 1 10 br br watch it only if you love rat and vermin based horror films wait check that don't watch it it's crap br br www residenthazard com
<START> i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean shaven kerrigan's first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen br br but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character br br is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some johns and not others the filmmaker doesn't seem to know br br it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasn't the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary br br after the screening i saw kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned rhetoric i think it was a cop out br br i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches
<START> even though this movie is quite old no matter how many times i watch it it still makes me laugh br br one particular quote in the movie stands out br br when danny joe piscopo pulls up to the d a's office parks in a disabled spot danny's partner says br br can't park here it's for the handicapped br br danny replies i am handicapped i'm psychotic br br that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch it'll make you chuckle br br johnny dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy spoof movies of all time br br as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast so watch this movie like myself many others who have watched it you'll be hooked
<START> panic is a sneaky little gem of a film you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize with great pleasure that henry bromell is a much better writer director than that br br the film builds slowly with one quietly devastating scene after another all enacted perfectly by william h macy donald sutherland neve campbell tracey ullman john ritter and the most remarkable child actor i've seen in a long time david dorfman as macy's son who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind rich and rewarding this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled
<START> god zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan and probably had about as many actors in the title role br br this serial is one of my own personal favourites and as previously stated it is one of the top 5 sound serials oddly enough this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 by the time of this production in '39 zorro was really well known as a pulp literary and movie character the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexico's struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy namely spain the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary war br br the story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its 'council' it is being addressed by benito juarez on their gold mine's relation to the new republic of mexico gold shipments must get thru to mexico city br br don francisco uncle to diego vega states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys a thug from the don del oro mob stages an 'insult' to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords don frasncisco getting run through br br suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark 'z' on the face of the bad guy he dispatches him to the hereafter don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon william corson that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro but expires before completing statement br br there is a big reception for diego at don francisco's hacienda where diego disappoints ramon'sister also ward of don francisco with his timid act a fop she declares br br later diego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers when they ask who will lead us with don francisco now dead ramon declares zorro we are zorro's fighting legion well there is a big battle with the legion now all clad on gray with masks and capes protecting the gold train then zorro seems trapped at a man made avalanche intended for the convoy when well you know cliffhanger end of chapter one br br wow that was a lot of writing for one chapter but like most other serials the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line let's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good well made action filled chapters following br br zorro's fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of 'don del oro' we had soldiers renegade whites hostile indians and the legion br br in short it's safe to say that there is everything one could want and then some in this serial and incidentally they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accents br br as to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest what makes it different or unique well br br first of all it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track br br and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others that is the film not only has a heroic musical theme but it also sports lyrics yes the legionairres sing we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing br br when the serial was first shown on our local television circa 1955 all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to 'captain braddock from racket squad the tv series mr hadley had a very distinctive deep voice he also handled the role very well his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional br br there is a small slip up a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarez carleton young addressing the san mendelito council as juarez was about 18 years old at this time 1824 and though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexico's history he surely hadn't achieved such prominence yet his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers' juarez that year which starred paul muni in the title role br br this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial but also my favourite zorro film br br we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year what with gone with the wind mr smith goes to washington the citadel juarez the wizard of oz of mice and men one million b c zenobia we want our mummy all counted among the output that year br br once again juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 about 25 years later also the political sub divisions are referred to as 'provinces' in the story in actuality they are called 'states' just as we are called the united states of america so too south of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexico br br reed hadley was prominent in some very 'a' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect watch listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street 1945 and guadalcanal diary 1945
<START> my left foot in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters the performances were smashing the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect i thought that christy daniel day lewis was a very talented man although i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time in addition when he threw a tantrum i got a little scared also it's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy in conclusion if you are a die hard fan of daniel day lewis or like biopics i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters you're in for a real treat and a good time so don't miss this one
<START> a hit at the time but now better categorised as an australian cult film the humour is broad unsubtle and in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it crude contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian pilgrimage to 'the old country' and every cliche about those rapacious stuck up whinging tory brits would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors and to australians of that generation who can 'get' the humour americans forget it the language and jokes are in the australian dialect of english and as such will be unintelligible
<START> at first i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet but as i casually saw this movie i was totally captive by the story already as the jewish watchman primary said that he knows no one who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w campbell junior was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war terrific and the fictitious story about the most effective spy for the usa in wwii who have lost everything that was important for his life is wonderful emotional transcribed this is the best story about the duality of humanity i've ever heard about the questions this movie is introducing are in my opinion very important for our society when does someone bear the guilt of something what is guilt who is a hero and who is a felon what is important in our life can you live without paying attention to the political changes is the protagonist guilty or not these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years this is a must see for everyone who have to think about the acception of war this movie is a must see for everyone who meditate what matters in life and what doesn't
<START> i think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that it is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most but in her case what she did was remarkable i have been in the mental health field for five years and i think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and i believe she helped i always thought she was great and always will i am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made she is a remarkable lady and i hope she continues to act she has been through a lot and has faced it i would really love to see her work more with children especially child actors her ordeal should not have happened and i think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people the movie was so moving to me that i was very touched suffering a tbi which brought the onset of my disorder and having ptsd it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did i believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help thank you ms duke or anna which ever you prefer
<START> there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood cary grant was an angel in the bishop's wife 1947 of course the best were the topper movies in the late '30s early '40s and more recently warren beatty's heaven can wait 1978 which was a remake of 1941's here comes mr jordan these were well written funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels br br now comes writer director jeff lowell making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman kate eva longoria parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist ashley lake bell who is falling for kate's fiancÃ© henry paul rudd one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no constance bennett marion kerby in the first two topper films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured br br there is a line right at the beginning when henry's sister chloe lindsay sloane tells henry you don't smile that aptly described my situation throughout this film br br the main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny but it's made worse by longoria parker's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen just to start out with compounding her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue she's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is br br chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kate's death from what i saw of kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to ashley who really doesn't know what she's doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate there's a lot of meshugaas that goes on br br the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a b story revolving around ashley's assistant dan jason biggs this is thrown in near the end but the way ashley handles it indicates that she's as much of a boob as kate since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he gets br br eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin it doesn't and more's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny as it is norman z mcleod constance bennett roland young alan mowbray and co must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two topper films has wrought
<START> this movie supposedly a thriller had about five sub plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawn br br the writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter br br the worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middle east i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if there's absolutely nothing else to do
<START> the concept was ok but hardly original the acting was plastic but the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a grubby one at that this is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time don't dare to watch it with your kids
<START> i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both the movie more than the book made me come close to tears on several occasions this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible i give it ten stars
<START> this was a typical grade b movie in 1940s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch george macready and dame may witty as a female villain of all people br br when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter in law and wife respectively macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimed br br the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does why don't people believe her
<START> two things haunt you throughout l'intrus the intruder who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching the ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions the intruder pops up as different characters different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene so they're expelled from it kindly or brutally but often without emotional involvement the main character louis is a contemptible man he's got rough ways some mean job and no heart he needs one and goes after it he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life can this man succeed in his quest for redemption a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat you know it but claire denis doesn't encourage you to judge him occasionally there's a young russian woman a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth who does judge him she may even punish him but not denis there's the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him don't touch me she says but denis lets this man be himself films him in his self absorbed quest i don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics whatever she films you get it in the end you know who's the intruder you know why more or less and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning but was it a movie or a dream
