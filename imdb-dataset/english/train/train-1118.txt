<START> i first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on uk's 2000ad my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point i'd really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark pronounced apparently choy huk br br yet for all the smoky back lit exteriors and ambitious special effects stop motion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse and though joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isn't this will always be the enduring image of that actress br br some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around 1700 that's a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chest br br for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together it's about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss it's about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of true love and the comedy stylings of wu ma don't hurt a bit either br br enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and you'll get on with it just fine
<START> a very funny east meets west film influenced by the closure of gm's flint michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us set in western pennsylvania it features great performances by michael keaton gedde watanabe and george wendt music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan
<START> as the story in my family goes my dad milton raskin played the piano for the dorsey band after sinatra joined the band my dad practiced with him for hours on end then at a point in time my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group band and that he should venture off on his own by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that dorsey never forgave my dad and the rest as they say is history br br i have some pictures and records to that effect and so does berkley university in california br br i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say and his movies never get old thank you frank
<START> this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself first blood pt 2 is very similar to schwarzenegger's commando but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys this movie is a typical american anti soviet propaganda true this was the peak of the cold war but i'm sick of having communists or the nazis always being shown as the enemy there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common why can't there a movie that show americans as the enemy who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army do you really think that something like this would have really happened by the looks of it an average brain washed american viewer certainly would
<START> nothing is fantastic simple as that it's a film that shouldn't work yet does natali stays in the realm of sci fi however this film is also a comedy cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali at 7 5million woo hoo pa so with nothing he scales down again this is low budget independent film making at it's best simple good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask no it is not anything like seinfeld basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with by bizarre mis fortunes however dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work place incriminating dave and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout canadian humour people as it turns out andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling they are desperate and can't escape and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white what has happened have dave and andrew died they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet no police no demolition team no angry girl scout mother what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world they are left alone the house is surrounded by nothing which is portrayed as pure white so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water they begin to tire of each other they discover they can hate away hunger which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say i can't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold br br this film is quirky funny interesting the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube david hewlett and andrew millar to lead the film they have chemistry and also work very well they have to hold 90 of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background yet it works certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers br br natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature i prey to god he doesn't do the proposed necropolis written and directed by add sufferer the ever crap paul anderson vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad run run like the wind i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex proyas did with the enjoyable yet pussy footed sugar coated helium light i robot keep your eyes peeled for this guy
<START> such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow up should be it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality br br the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of australian history legend and horses the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism the plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry the lead cast from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton and a well replaced brian dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film as far as sequels can go the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again
<START> kolchak the night stalker is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy sarcastic forty something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural and occasionally extraterrestrial forces based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character this series died a quick death in the mid 1970s due to low ratings but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today but will the average modern day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead br br that's actually a tough question to answer fairly detractors of this series tend to argue that it's formulaic and hopelessly dated on the other hand fans argue that it's cleverly written well acted and sometimes genuinely spooky and me i've got a foot in both camps i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws br br i'll address the question of kolchak being formula fiction first now i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern for example repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek out repetitive entertainment however the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid it's too repetitive even by the most generous standards br br in almost every episode kolchak investigates a murder and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster he tries to publish a story about said monster but his editor vincenzo blocks him always on the grounds that kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work and alas kolchak is also obstructed by the police so in the end kolchak does some independent research on the monster figures out how to kill it and then kills it without ceremony or reward or writing a big story about it br br you can see where this ever so strict formula might get tiresome right i'm particularly mystified by vincenzo if kolchak's always raving about monsters and vincenzo never believes it well then why doesn't vincenzo fire kolchak or have him committed that's what any normal boss would do but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists as a result many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable though they are also quite funny br br the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula however usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist these select episodes are good enough that i think they're largely immune to typical criticisms of the series some of my favorites include br br horror in the heights an episode that's noteworthy for being grimy inventive and socially aware kolchak's dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula the script written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster is remarkably literate and it delves deeply into the monster's backstory br br the devil's platform a possible inspiration for the omen films this episode stands out to me because the villain a very young tom skerritt tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies and in so doing reveals a lot about the reporter's character br br firefall this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans but i enjoyed it because it's got a great red herring and a really creepy almost unstoppable seeming monster br br though i've singled out these three episodes for praise i'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least for my money there are only two complete turkeys in the 20 episode run primal scream which is about monkey men running rampant in chicago and the sentry which features the dumbest looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan br br on balance then this is a good series a little repetitive a little cheesy perhaps but it has elements of greatness even during the weaker episodes darren mcgavin's wonderful performance as the caustic world weary endlessly funny kolchak truly shines he carries the series effortlessly in a way that for example sarah michelle gellar never managed on buffy mcgavin was one great character actor and this series is worth watching for him alone
<START> i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies after about 30 minutes i just rushed and picked out a few i stumbled upon masters of horror which contained pro life and right to die they seemed ok same old cheesy horror crap but i was interested for some reason it said about pro life on the case about being a classic a return to form for john carpenter i loved his the thing so i thought this would be good and all that so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting i was very wrong it started off casual just a girl running through a forest scared of something a car stops and picks her up just so being the people she needed to see amazing they take her back to some clinic and examine her at the sametime all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in he isn't aloud near the area most likely from something he would of done in the past but you don't know of any of this at the moment he really does not want his daughter in this place an abortion center he is very strongly against such acts believing it's sickening and not what god would want he supports what i heard is called pro life acting against abortions and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born they are sick they don't like the life of an unborn being taken yet they've killed humans in the past to allow the birth justice is only a figment of the mind anyway back on track after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant but far ahead than what she should be she is only a few weeks pregnant but is months ahead she keeps telling them they wont understand her and that she wants an abortion and all but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell and that her father wants this baby but believes god wants this baby not who truly does he gets his 3 sons they arm themselves with pistols and shotguns and begin to make they're way into the clinic shooting down anyone who won't co operate the head of the clinic who must of had trouble with them in the past is well prepared this time ends up killing one the fathers sons but in the end gets shot a few times wearing a bullet proof jacket the father then performs what he believes is done to the women he cuts a hole where the vagina would be if he we're a female and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood whilst all this is happening the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs and some demon raises from beneath the earth not in the same room and starts looking for its child the father sees this later on and starts questioning why this happened he did what he was told to do and doesn't understand why it's like this the demon had killed both of his sons earlier and now goes for father whilst the girl kills the baby and the demon carries it away not in the same scene br br yeah it probably sounds pretty cool and a thrilling horror movie but it isn't the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm the script is boring and not even creative they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them just everything put together all the small parts don't even add up to something great a waste of time i wouldn't classify this as a horror though it has elements of horror they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed it felt more like a beginners short movie than by john carpenter br br sorry for my lack of information and detailed review i just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect i couldn't really be bothered to research anything
<START> this movie is fun to watch if you liked dave with kevin klein you will get a kick out of this think dave gone south american as dreyfus plays jack noah an actor between jobs who is hand selected by the head of the island nation of parador's secret police to replace the drunken sot of a dictator alfonse simms after he has had a heart attack and died noah bumbles along aided in his role by the ex dictator's mistress as they attempt to thwart the plans of raul julia jonathan winters also makes an appearance as a hearty american Ã©migrÃ© who turns out to be cia also starring polly holiday and fernando rey br br there are a few absurd moments such as the body of the old dictator be kept frozen for a year and the final scene where sonia braga who has bee cradling the bloody bullet riddled body of dreyfus is seen moments later all in pristine white with nary a smudge on her but all in all it is a great romp
<START> sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast i'm not saying that the acting was good because it wasn't but every actor actress was hot and attractive br br one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time it's not that i'm against nudity but this was a horror movie not 'the dreamers' br br unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or you're a die hard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if you're looking for a good horror movie stay away
<START> sequels hardly ever live up to the original this definitely proves true in this case however if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch although the camera work is lacking brian krause's character is annoying and the plot is clique it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it br br don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film quite frankly it's a bit different rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action br br i'm giving it a 6 out of 10
<START> this is one of the funniest series ever i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor if only someone would release in america region 0 or 1 non pal please br br i know it being released in the uk but that's region 2 and pal besides let's give this series its fair shake america must know this series moffat is a genius i loved tracie bennett's quirky goofy role in this of course i liked fiona gillies but tracie was a treasure br br release this show in america or show it again on the pbs stations i need to laugh and laugh again please indulge us please please br br thanks for reading

<START> if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic 10 10 why isn't this movie in the top 250 list
<START> i don't know where to begin the cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since debralee scott is listed on cover boxes but does not appear in the movie at all the writing is quite bad even for college films it's obviously very low budget with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing br br the characters are pretty typical for college films timid guy nerd suave black guy tough guys guy with mustache attractive girl small town girl etc the featured teacher is about what's you'd expect middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily br br if you wan't to see a college flick stay clear from this one it's so bad it's not even funny
<START> probably the worst bollywood film i've seen br br no plot line very little character developments br br full of silly and pointless humor the whole film was chaotic and direction less there was no proper ending to the story the airport was filmed in a shopping mall br br same story chewed over and over again until you want to say please just move on with it even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed br br the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days br br btw i'm not from an indian background br br 2 10
<START> at least the under ten year old set will stay interested eleanor geena davis and fred hugh laurie little a nice well to do couple set out to bring home from the orphanage a new little brother for their son george johnathan lipnicki they come home with quite the odd new sibling a sharp dressed little mouse named stuart voiced by michael j fox yes mouse stuart is happy to have found the sense of belonging even if it is in a super sized world that contains his new family's pet cat snowbell voiced by nathan lane stuart embarks on the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship george will finally accept his tiny new brother when the dapper dressed stuart saves embarrassment at a model boat race br br also in the cast julia sweeney harold gould estelle getty and jeffery jones and the voices of chaz palminteri bruno kirby and jennifer tilly
<START> i remember this movie from the 50s when i was in college it is one of the funniest satires of american westerns that i have ever seen i'm only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd it is a real treat
<START> this is the first non zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b movie the dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process jane longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs curse of the komodo coughs i enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general overall 3 6 stars and worth a watch
<START> what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends br br the story has a true to life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolve br br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy
