<START> of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste br br take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle
<START> the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time sarah michelle gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe i'm wrong and that was just a flashback with this movie it's impossible to tell can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel that movie had it all sluts zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm the forgotten didn't even have one of these things
<START> i was hoping for some sort of in depth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission linked by over hyped disaster predicting sensationalising voice over in the worst tradition of tv production br br if you could cut out the voice over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great but i feel i've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme i want those minutes back
<START> the original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences unfortunately the sequel while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle br br the biggest letdown is a lack of a story like belle's magical world the characters are told through a series of vignettes magical world while marginally better still manages to make a mess of the story in between the vignettes we see the mice at work and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie br br the first vignette is the best about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess this is the best because the mice were at their funniest here the worst of the vignettes when jaq turns into a human is cute at times but has a lack of imagination the last vignette when anastasia falls in love was also cute the problem was i couldn't imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom br br the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to however i hated the songs they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original br br the characters were the strongest development here cinderella while still caring had lost her sincerity and a lot of her charm from the original though she does wear some very pretty clothes the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren't enough to save the film likewise with prudence and the king as i mentioned the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie as they alone contributed to the film's cuteness i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average and the voice acting was surprisingly good br br all in all a cute if unoriginal sequel that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story 4 10 for the mice the voice acting the animation and some pretty dresses bethany cox
<START> this movie is simply awesome it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb this movie did not create any controversy in india as far as i know and its publicity was also kept low initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka mangal pandey loc etc br br there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added br br but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie also a must watch br br if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor producer and firoz abbas khan the director for making such a great movie
<START> when i saw this movie a few days ago my eyes were completely fixed to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime but to anyone who likes great movies period or who likes really weird stuff the style of art is beautiful the sound is perfect and the symbolism within it is breathtaking i've heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie the self attributed description of hello kitty on acid doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions i'd like to find more works by whoever made this and see them
<START> you know jason you know freddy and you know leatherface now get ready for the safety pin killer that's right in killer workout a dumb slasher movie if i've ever seen one the unseen murderer dispatches his or her victims with an oversized novelty safety pin it is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing br br as the title suggests an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect in fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it's really just process of elimination br br oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the aerobics classes continue in earnest in fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing while three men are murdered in the next room the workout goes on death isn't even a factor one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout br br cop chases explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of women's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure much like the woman caught in the tanning bed i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout finally thankfully the end flashed on the screen what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them br br
<START> is this the future that awaits us an overpopulated unforgiving wasteland with a hellish unwanted existence this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this br br soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much it had likable characters a semi apocalyptic setting a compelling and thought provoking storyline and the macho est macho man out there charleton heston richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant dirty feel you're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants br br the characters are wonderful charleton heston who has become one of my favorite actors is thorn the man created this role of badass yet likable tough guy i could definitely put myself in thorn's shoes he sees that something isn't right but everyone around him either doesn't listen more like paid not to listen or wants him dead edward g robinson in his last film r i p plays the lovable old sol who has had enough of this nasty place everyone else is great especially leigh taylor young as shirl a piece of furniture that comes with the apartment in which she resides br br the special effects are fantastic even for 1973 the soylent green factory the futuristic apartments and especially the scoops bulldozers that get rid of people were excellent the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling br br one final note is the ending which even now still shocked me it is gruesome but if you think about it it's a pretty good idea br br the bottom line br br an excellent 70's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy
<START> run do not walk away from this movie aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears if the gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar this film just lowered it it's slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen this movie had me dry heaving in the cat box just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series br br spoilers beyond this point here are the top 10 reasons gamera fans of the 90's series will hate this film br br 10 this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die br br 9 you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film he gets his butt kicked by a few gyaos and self destructs he looks old and lethargic plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen his suit looked cheap and rushed br br 8 the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon big eyed and cute it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2 gamera is now too cute br br 7 this movie has the pace of watching a nascar race during a 3 hour rain delay i watched this movie with 2 other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along i've seen an suv full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster br br 6 like godzilla final wars this movie had very little kaiju time on screen final wars had much more actually and better fights although short br br 5 kids take the title role the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the 2000's the most successful gamera films abandoned the sesame street feel and went to a darker place why go back to a failed formula this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue thank god br br 4 gamera lost his iconic roar he now sounds like an elephant with strep throat br br 3 this movie may produce a new olympic event imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm's way you have to see the ending to understand this point where were the parents oh yea right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone br br 2 the special effects were good but sub par for a gamera movie legion and iris had better effects the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly not too impressive br br 1 this movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect the director was involved in power rangers and it shows it comes off like a cross between et always sunset on third street and tmnt kudos if you know all 3 references br br rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series
<START> the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell lochlyn munro has brought a farming property which he is renovating planning to turn into a holiday inn he is joined by his girlfriend darcy wagner chandra west her young 12 year old daughter pamela nicole munoz who arrive to help for the weekend while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma jianna ballard who warns her that evil lurks within her new home she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children then kills them pamela is worried becomes even more so when she falls off her bike her last baby tooth falls out it's not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on pamela's tooth just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across br br directed by chuck bowman i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straight to video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves fill late night obscure cable tv schedules basically it's not very good the script by producer stephen j cannell corey strode cookie rae brown is a complete snooze fest for the first 40 odd minutes nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone it introduces the character's sets the tooth fairy legend up that's it the second half of the film improves slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff there are a few decent set piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable forgettable stuff the character's aren't great most of them are there purely to be killed off the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 why has she come back as a ghost despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself using weapons to kill people there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment br br director bowman does ok it's reasonably well made there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about there's nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here don't take any notice of the comparisons between this darkness falls 2003 as besides the teeth thing they're quite different the gore is ok someone is shoved into a wood chipping machine there's a decapitation someone has their penis chopped off the best scene when someone is nailed to a door then has their stomach hacked open with an axe their guts slide out br br with a supposed budget of about 1 500 000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here the acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad unusually i didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something i suppose br br the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight to video horror fare that seems everywhere these days if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor forgettable stuff
<START> i viewed this movie in dvd format my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani while fun to watch i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance however they were fairly enjoyable also the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion the story line while some could say slightly compelling lacked direction i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film but otherwise leave it alone
<START> remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn't quite meet those same feelings as an adult that occurred to me when i went back to school the national lampoon's class reunion the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth a man who appears to be a vampire and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head you have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread but as we see in the film he's a coward and joke a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed and no one can seem to remember his name this is the one running joke i enjoyed there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog and the cook you know her from goonies and throw mama from the train who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands the film is essentially about a nutcase who is or at least attempting to taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened trashed hallways of the old high school they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself the film has a few good gags that work pretty much early on but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute the film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go the film is pretty much a one joke premise for it has unassured direction if it really has any direction at all the cast is enthusiastic enough but the material they are to make funny just doesn't have the quality to hold any interest it's a curio for fans of early 80's comedy relics that are forgotten this one rightfully so
<START> istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs it's a remake of the fred macmurray ava gardner film singapore from a decade ago br br unlike that studio product istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn but errol flynn who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film was way too old to be playing these action adventure types any longer his scenes with cornell borchers really do lack conviction br br as for cornell she plays errol's former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia she both doesn't remember errol and is now married to torin thatcher br br but errol's got some nasty people led by martin benson and werner klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession got to deal with them too br br best reason to see istanbul is to hear nat king cole sing and play the piano most people today don't realize that cole was an accomplished jazz pianist they only think of him as a singer actually he was a pianist first the singing was an afterthought br br istanbul is a routine action adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie
<START> typical de palma movie made with lot's of style and some scene's that will bring you to the edge of your seat br br most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller is the style it has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat the best scene's from the movie the museum scene and the elevator murder there are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie so this movie might not be suitable for everybody br br the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie br br there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking not bad for a 49 year old br br the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well just like his score for the other de palma movie body double br br brilliant nerve wrecking thriller i love de palma br br 10 10
<START> sterling and younger brother try to survive on land being squeezed by big cattlemen when 'rogue' brother preston arrives a moral dilemma ensues john 'drew' barrymore steals the show as the younger impressionable brother barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax
<START> there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii but sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks tachiguishi is one of them and even though i loved it to bits it's not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it br br in between his big and serious films oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category oshii has really outdone himself with this one creating something that is very hard to classify even as a freaky japanese flick go figure br br at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level oshii's approach on the subject has close ties with dai nipponjin as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be deadpan humor taken to the extreme br br but that is not all rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation a weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick performed and acted out or posed if you want by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as low budget as possible br br and if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogue heavy making it a good companion piece for innocence the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues and to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film br br that said on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post war japan the film plays like you'd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and crudely animated cut out photography limbs of which figures are assembled don't quite make it all that serious the range of characters introduced is sublime shinji higuchi taking the cake as cow creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast food chains with his gang of bull people br br oshii regular kenji kawai provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film br br visually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogue heavy despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film br br beware though because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer if you don't speak japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention on top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about i'm sure i missed many of the finer points of the film br br tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesn't let off from there on i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs a dub would actually be best for a film like this much like container though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for br br with all of that said i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film it's rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works the film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity it is immensely funny even if you can't catch all the details on the first viewing but be sure to at least get this with decent subs as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all br br tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and i'm not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe and the rest of the western world is still waiting for a sign of this film but for those that like oshii appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire 4 5 5 0
<START> first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel revelation matthew 24 isaiah and other prophetic scriptures there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations as a christian though an amillenialist i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low br br no what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message but rather its lack of production values awful script mediocre acting and pitiful fx this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s no this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel br br the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this but they failed the left behind series the apocalypse series and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem but their scripts are still poor and their acting is wooden br br there are great christian films with extremely low budgets but this film is not one of them i'm surprised the mst3k crew never lampooned this one
<START> the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi autistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances
<START> the potential movie extravaganza set during the 19th century failed to produce with big name actors like maggie smith albert finney and many others there was no reason for the movie to fail however the movie lacked an ending had a sorry excuse for a plot line and fell to pieces with its continuity a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy brought together by love and destroyed by beauty or lack thereof and disapproval has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father the father played by finney is a disturbed man tormenting his daughter in life as well as death he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status the actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 purely for the actors' attempts save yourself stay clear of washington square
<START> the bad news is it's still really dreadful i gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny br br it's supposed to be better than mulva zombie ass kicker and progress should be rewarded or maybe i was drinking heavily when i watched it and felt generous whatever 2 it is br br maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick it takes elements from most of kill bill i ii's key themes and fight scenes hacks them up dumbs them way down dirties up the dialog and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video br br you'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one and get this dvd back to the video store on time you'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee
