<START> haunted boat sells itself as 'the fog' meets 'open water' in many ways this is accurate there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested br br however the acting ability is poor at best showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film which in all credit they do to the best of their ability when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on br br many aspects of the film are creepy and strange but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end you actually want to know what is going on and are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax br br this is no ghost ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the t v
<START> full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy it's not like i hate it but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the first br br full house is about widower danny tanner bob saget and his three daughters d j candace cameron stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate and ashley when danny's wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave coulier and the girls' uncle jesse john stamos moves in with them once they live there together they find they can't live without each other br br full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
<START> before seeing this movie i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now it's everything minus one james woods is pathetic not his character his acting someone should've told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche ditto for randy quaid's stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess if you enjoy the country you'll enjoy the scenery that's the best i can give it br br i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible
<START> this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection br br the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me br br but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over br br i think the voice over is too glib
<START> before writing this review i went back and reread the reviews of others this movie was a particular disappointment to me since it features two of my favorite dancers gene kelly and george chakiris boasts a score by the often wonderous michel legrand wuthering heights ice station zebra the thomas crowne affair the dancing was stilted unmotivated and unoriginal the songs forgettable the story a joke even the costuming was not particularly flattering only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit i'm glad other people enjoyed the young girls of rochefort though i most certainly did not
<START> genre dinosaur animation new york time travel circus br br main characters rex the tyrannosaurus rex elsa the pterodactyl dweeb the parasarolophus ooo the triceratops a boy called louis a girl called cecilia and captain new eyes actors john goodman rex yeardley smith cecilia martin short stubbs the clown felicity kendal elsa etc br br what happens four dinosaurs see above are fed some brain grain cereal and are now cuddly friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children they go into new york with big plansÂ br br my thoughts this is a cute animated film the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not so good but they look pleasant all the same that way i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly they are nice friendly and good i like almost all the characters featured especially elsa and cecilia but of course i like the others as well overall i like this film a lot br br recommended to people who like good children's animated films people who like dinosaurs john goodman and people who think that circuses aren't always what they seemÂ enjoy
<START> arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state it's most popular game show is the running man in which criminals are forced to survive against stalkers that live to kill them br br the movie opens with ben richards arnold leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name butcher of bakersfield eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin koto and harold weiss mcintyre breakout of a detention zone they worked in they make their way to the underground led by mic mick fleetwood mic quickly identifies richards as the butcher of bakersfield and refuses to help him but his friend's convince him otherwise they want him to join the resistance but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez alonso has taken his apartment knowing who he is she won't help him but he convinces her but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out br br meantime the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill damon killian dawson the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture richards refuses to play killian threatens to use his friends instead of him so he signs the contract you'll love that part but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable sub zero buzz saw and many others eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off br br the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name some have said that the book is better i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows hate boat among others also the cast was great besides arnold koto and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka jim brown ventura and sven ole with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the evil bush the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things blasphemy overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him you can't miss this its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day the futuristic world and humor are great overall 10 out 10 stars definitely one of his best
<START> i'm really getting old am in the midst of watching this 40 year old flick and wonder what my grandchildren will be watching 40 years from now its an old saying but they don't make em like that anymore it's not only the story its the music the acting both by young and old the cast it would seem were born to play their roles young oliver old fagin too many to mention them all the role played by the judge oliver stands before i've seen in other roles over the years the artful dodger ron moody as fagin mr and mrs bumble the movie not only won 5 oscars but took a few golden globe awards too if you decide to see this film do yourself a favor take a few if not all the children to see this masterpiece
<START> if you see this movie you know you will see an extense video clip of popular music but you will find more incredible fx great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids if you compare this movie you have to remember is a pop extravaganza clips of man in the mirror leave me alone smooth criminal and beatles' come together
<START> henry fool surprised me i didn't expect it to entertain and amuse as well or as strongly as it did fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie however it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film at least as good as ginger snaps back if not better br br i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum's part is so small but i'm happy he is a part of this short run he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim the son of fay and henry br br this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons i am pleased for example to discover that henry isn't really the loser he seems by the end of fool and to further discover that he is in fact a genius well that really is a lovely stroke of the pen br br i am hoping they do a third like the end of the trilogy it seems to be missing they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father to validate the awesome change in his mother and the sense of near genius he himself feels welling inside him assuming of course that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father it feels like it needs to be done i'd buy it br br even with more action this is still not an action flick it is more drama and intrigue a mystery of sorts i'll watch it often br br it rates an 8 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal br br one of the reasons that was so at least for me was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted with too little contrast it doesn't look good at least on vhs once in a while it breaks out and looks great but not often also the characters come and go too quickly for example i would have liked to have seen more of moby dick when the film starts to drag however it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong br br overall just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years
<START> this film is not deserved of the next few minutes i will spend criticizing it but i know many people like myself rely on imdb com to assist in deciding on films for that reason alone i am writing this br br live feed is like an asian version of 1976's the incredible torture show aka blood sucking freaks http www imdb com title tt0077247 torture dismemberment murder cannibalism sure it's all here along with a third grade script pathetic acting and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy br br the film takes place in china yet everyone speaks english there is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor one gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film the film is absolutely awful even for a b movie even if you were to download it for free it would be an insult to your hard drive
<START> this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson wields a tommy gun plain and simple br br this movie rocks because it is freaking' hilarious it may be creepy to see jacko w little kids but this movie also stars wait for it br br joe pesci br br think about it joe pesci and jacko with tommy guns throwing coins into jukeboxes from 20 feet away whats not to like as stated before this movie rocks
<START> with its companion piece masters of horror nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limits br br of course part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience instead aiming at ten year olds who are only able to count body bags and scarcely that and so grossness is king and king is grossness br br stephen king is simply illiterate Â in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies br br true the cinema is not such a bad place to start since it has generally escaped the onslaught of realism but these films are only the rumor not the thing and if you want to write you have to dig deeper br br of course only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances but even so it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosi br br at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary br br not mind you trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part making the stupid stupider but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things wouldn't that be gross and that boys and girls is the story br br what about characterization oh yes he's one of these suits who never really appreciated life you know and now it's too late right and he's shouting Â well they can't actually hear him you know Â he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital but he's not such a big shot anymore you see lying there or is it laying i can never remember and all and he's thinking oh no please please don't cut me and this is terrible lying or laying like that Â now wouldn't that be a great story you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie what was the name of that snake again oh yeah a boomslang Â has quite a ring to it doesn't it br br let's make it a peruvian boomslang sure steve that's great Â except that boomslang is afrikaans you moron but how can you really tell that the target audience is children and not simply mental defects it's easy there's no sex br br well there is but it's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent's bedroom modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre the monster the female victim the chase br br but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea what's going on all that's really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil br br in spite of a certain discrepancy in size king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray freddy krueger can only kill her br br and since there's no real titillation in that he has to torture her first Â not in any way that might excite her you understand since that would upset our puritan sentiments and so horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths br br our hero you see is a rubber fetishist and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know Â rubber gloves giggle and that's what they use in autopsies and that's how they discover that he is in fact you know br br obviously this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers too bad they cut it out since it might have upset the five year olds watching the show
<START> the only explanation i can muster as to why this film isn't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some this movie was a genuine happy surprise the satire is genius this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized religion and big media and the roaches scurry for cover rent the dvd and watch it for yourself if you haven't yet this film succeeds where many have failed dogma comes to mind to poke it's nose under the tent both by using humor and very clever analogies coupled with telling backdrops and locations can't comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by
<START> for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures it isn't bad and is a decent time passer but not much more br br kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and detached ms novak also begins to fall in love with stewart and apparently in the witch's rule book this is a definite no no br br the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the baby sacrificing nor the all powerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps and very oddly the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world br br anyway the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact i almost scored the film a 6 it was really close
<START> this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it if you take the first movie and reverse the plot ariel wants to leave the sea her daughter wants to go to the sea take the same characters and give them new animals and new names and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor possible you get the little mermaid 2 its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot i'll take you through the horror of it step by step these are the people from the 1st movie first of all prince eric is still prince eric with about 3 lines in the whole movie ariel is uptight annoying and is not the carefree headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st in fact she is the exact opposite sebastian is still sebastian only less cute less convincing as being stressed out and the jokes just aren't funny anymore flounder has about 2 lines he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny king triton's character is probably the best he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter melody ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter br br like i said all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them this is what they did ursula the new evil villain is morgana ursula's sister who feels like she always lived in ursula's shadow i wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife she can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain she has the same voice ursula did sebastian flounder have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks tip dash a walrus and a penguin they try to be hero's but always fail when trying the plot is so predictable they become heroes at the end yawn flatson jetsom now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton hes really bad too morgana and the shark sharkbait i think was his name have no chemistry good or bad ariel ah ariel our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un lovely daughter melody melody cannot sing her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet she wants to go to the sea she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her she has to go find herself yawn br br not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original br br basically comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca don't ever watch this not even when your bored
<START> given the chance to write direct and star in my own movie i would probably choose something about robot women with guns anthony hopkins however decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen slipstream is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say 'what's going on ' br br this is a movie where in one scene a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls this is a movie where a man starts talking about invasion of the bodysnatchers only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself and then disappear into thin air br br this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all br br i must however commend mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie some of whom portray multiple characters all of those involved throw themselves into their roles even if they probably have no idea what they're actually doing my favourite here was christian slater's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the american national anthem br br anthony hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that's possibly the best way to sum up slipstream it's a joke on the audience you'll watch it from beginning to end trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come only to discover that the answer never actually does what the punchline to this particular joke is only anthony hopkins will ever know br br i mentioned david lynch earlier and i'm a big fan of that particular director i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of twin peaks blue velvet and lost highway however slipstream isn't as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in slipstream it's far too chaotic and random as another reviewer here pointed out it's the movie version of alzheimer's disease no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it unfortunately for the rest of us slipstream quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to hopkins' involvement br br watch at your own risk
<START> these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now some pieces of this work were really memorable id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff actually i'd love to be part of it br br if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make 10 lines if text as this website requires i mean really this almost discourages me i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye and it took me 3 times to have enough lines i hope you don't get me on the misspelling yup you did
<START> if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated children's show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment don't worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbed down show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip 'n dale's rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere br br while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there's rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don't have and of course in the middle of it all there's baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever there's trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all sea duck read james bond's aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesn't disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept soviet satirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family
