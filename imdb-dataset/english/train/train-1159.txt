<START> the planning episodes were a bit dull but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because much to my surprise charley fell out of the race relatively early when his hands were sore i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix but instead he actually quit the race the most anxious moment of the show must've been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it overall not as great as the long way round but definitely an interesting watch as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world
<START> father and son communicate very little in fact they speak different languages but when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage's to mecca the conversations finally take place they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts br br this movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals the imagery throughout is impressive especially the final scenes in mecca it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be but also at the same time how similar the same was true for the father and son in this film br br see this movie tell your friends to see it you'll be glad you did
<START> spoilers br br i saw the original on tv sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most beeb costume drama i rewatched on dvd this week and still have the same impression of it it's a good story at first but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and i got so totally irritated with her saintliness i suppose this was the right thing to do when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as i expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see but it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone so re the story as in the film i'm equivocal it's well done as per the novel but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life br br steadfast hero gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self denial and to be so consistently supportive so i felt it a great shame that when helen was at long last free to be with him the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up this was completely ridiculous when we'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine instead the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn't be bothered here you are one minute do what you can in that then cut as the director wants to go home now i was left feeling totally dissasatisfied br br however very high commendations to the acting of toby stephens a perfect and very handsome hero and rupert graves a superbly nasty and self pitying villain tara fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time br br that said i love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the modern drama on tv these days so 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it's still a good watch
<START> i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before namely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlin uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and what's more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family a common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did
<START> perhaps you won't care for the social commentary or the film makers point of view i myself am mystified at the Âinsignificance' angle kasdan seemed to promote Â when clearly the actions taken in the movie promote certain significance the ending confused me however there's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented the magnificent symbolism throughout the threaded character arcs visuals dialogue Â is absolute masterwork i've watched the movie dozens of times and i still marvel at its perfection there's not a moment action cut or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme realistic human performances from all the actors scene to scene it's woven fantastically br br i have a pretty level sap meter the buzzer never went off during this film if you're a thinker rather than a casual viewer Â this movie delivers exponentially absolutely mesmerizing do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not was it interesting br br personally the movie affected me Â significantly in my top 5 br br note the front page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed african american perception what he may have failed to recognize is there was a hand Â shake not a hand out the Âspiritually dead white man' simply saw a man to respect and admire and he did something about it the fact he was black had little if anything to do with it color is simply used to draw the parallel and the chasm it's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either if you view the blacks in this movie as Âtoken' Â you may want to reassess your angst you may be seeing only black and white yourself eh just a thought
<START> alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that br br i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie a low budget dreck like red zone cuba monster a go go and manos or a huge budget disgrace like gigli superbabies or this guff you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue movies like this happen because the director is a stupid money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience br br it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt has created something that only happens once in a blue moon the really terribly bad horror film everything about it is a mess cheesy cgi bad plot insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack br br alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody woo hoo review over give me a bud roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again br br don't watch this film
<START> if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre the director the producer the actors and the person that told you to go see it shame on you sarah michelle geller for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in english i wanted to boo when the movie ended a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie she just practiced her frowning skills don't waste your time or money on this film
<START> pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i enjoy watching bad movies like plan 9 from outer space but this thing doesn't even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or 1970's horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life
<START> this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking where'd you hear that or that can't possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless 'em the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars br br as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i've enjoyed and i'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all it's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the catskills except maybe gil scott heron his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being br br only bruce springsteen's performance raises a pulse i've never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it's no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll br br but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer's tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians br br so really there's only two things to watch this movie for springsteen's stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline
<START> wwe's last ppv of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans but for one reason only the ladder match which was only scheduled to be paul london and brian kendrick against william regal and dave taylor but with the recent crap ppv being december to dismember wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again this proved useful when it introduced mnm and the hardy boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match br br the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen but joey mercury's face was a total mess johnny nitro didn't even check on his partner they just carried on like nothing happened and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots in the end london and kendrick retained the titles br br elsewhere on the show kane defeated mvp in a decent inferno match when he set mvp's stupid costume on fire chris benoit downed chavo guerrero in a decent match gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the wwe cruiserweight title in a solid effort br br but the main event was a total mess king booker teamed with finlay to take on john cena and batista the action was shoddy and no one cared who batista picked for his partner br br overall results kane defeated mvp in an inferno match br br paul london and brian kendrick retained the wwe tag team titles against the hardy boyz mnm and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match br br chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero to retain the us title in a decent match br br gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the cruiserweight championship br br the boogeyman beat the miz in a terrible match br br the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match br br john cena and batista defeated king booker and finlay in an abysmal match br br overall grade b
<START> the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best i've seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses rich girl poor boy and ability vs bloodline the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as rambo meets the black stallion without the charm of the black stallion the young hero comes back from a 3 year absence and suddenly he's superman on horseback in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel i've hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angry they missed hardly a clichÃ© brazen audience manipulation do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie
<START> at first i was weirded out that a tv show's main character could bring the dead back to life but then i thought i'd give it a shot guess what i love pushing daisies and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr the colorful characters witty banter fast paced dialogue and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end ned and chuck charles' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact even detective emerson cod's character has continued to grow in complexity and olive snook jiminy crispies she cracks me up the narrator's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show i have recommended my family and friends to turn on pushing daisies and they are hooked too the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen p d i highly recommend watching it
<START> winter kills is a terrible incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy thriller from little known director william richert while watching the film i honestly felt as if i was the emperor in the classic fable the emperor's new clothes the film made me feel like a fool because i couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters but i felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots so i stuck with it to the end hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself then i realised the film is supposed to be serpentine nonsensical and illogical because that's the whole point this is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists with the knotting up of the plot used as a metaphor for the knotting up of truths half truths and lies that define any conspiracy even when i got that the joke was on me i still felt winter kills to be a pretty awful movie br br young nick kegan jeff bridges is the younger brother of a former united states president who was assassinated in philadelphia nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the president and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun nick follows the clues but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances also his father pa kegan john huston a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman keeps interfering with nick's investigation the deeper he delves into the assassination the more nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted br br the film is an utter nightmare to follow and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the afore mentioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up the cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted toshiro mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history elizabeth taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue richard boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere john huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery anthony perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs they really belong in another film the film's semi comic climax is farcical and disappointing yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way there's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for winter kills but i won't be counting myself among its number
<START> i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7 my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall i remember that it really sucked the plot had no sense i hated the fox that became casper's friend he was so stupid casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend so what get over it the only good part and i don't want to sound mean spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost i wish he had stayed dead i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall if you have a child don't let them watch this they will probably agree with me that it sucks
<START> i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it if it's using the original words in an updated setting that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles eg the trevor nunn twelfth night set late victorian very effectively it could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare's text unfortunately it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show br br another problem is branagh himself i agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important he's such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student his strength of acting shows all the time of course he should have played the king no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king thus an unimposing so called king with no kingly attributes br br the amount of song and dance which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection and i got very bored including with the comic turns and was glad when it ended branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production br br accolades however to richard briers and geraldine mcewan absolutely splendid as the older couple
<START> this is to the zatoichi movies as the star trek movies were to star trek except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big shiny re do and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this good looking but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient the idea of reviving the character in a bigger slicker production must have sounded good but there was no point in it other than the hope of making money it's just a show which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already also the actor wasn't at his best i'd been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies seasoned with more sex and sfx violence not the same experience at all
<START> i thought this movie was really really great helena did an amazing job in it i thought she played her character very well she's an awesome actress br br the movie was also really funny too the jokes were great i couldnt stop laughing br br i think everyone should see it br br
<START> being a filmmaker myself and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour i thought i was in for a treat when i took home my wrongs not that the dvd cover gives anything away instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director chris morris a short film including scenes i should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of twoddle br br the scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series brass eye and serves no purpose other than to shock how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand br br the runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here instead we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs this is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid br br to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled its over simplified message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated br br the film does have its moments of pseudo kafkaesque surrealism but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to enlighten and just ends up being irritating if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking i strongly recommend franz kafka's it's a wonderful life by peter capaldi
<START> it's cheesy it's creepy it's gross but that's what makes it so much fun it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh br br the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones they go to a small town to cover a festival but they can't get a room to stay the night and that's when they meet ernest keller he's creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there br br stephen furst's performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernest's family is kind of interesting br br just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy br br i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look
<START> i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the pre civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point br br maybe it's the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates br br actually there were two classes graduated in 1861 one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a four year course of study after a few years of experimenting with a five year course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer alonzo lon cushing james beauty stuart for j e b stuart class of 1854 etc br br i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that 1940 film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side by side in stopping john brown's 1859 insurrection at harper's ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in 1863 stuart was at the harper's ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place br br fanny custer plays a role in class of '61 though his classmate chums dev o'neill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o'rorke and john pelham two people you can look up br br anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid 19th century america
