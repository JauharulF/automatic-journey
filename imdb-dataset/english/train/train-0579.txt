<START> i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it's a mess i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic santa claus the movie but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting of course fred vince vaughn is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend rachel weisz in a cameo role dumping him so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus paul giamatti and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas now if you think you know the ending of this film i think you would be right because it's predicable to the hill as for the acting vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable miranda richardson plays mrs claus but the role is more than less one note elizabeth banks plays santa's assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film glengarry glen ross but a little more anal the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and rachel weisz who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them br br to put it in a nutshell a major disappointment
<START> when you add up all the aspects from the movie the dancing singing acting the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is vanessa williams her dedication energy and timeless beauty make rosie the perfect role for her never have i ever seen someone portray rose with such vibrancy vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me her dancing is so incredible even if as some people say the choreography was bad her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before i'd recommend this version over the '63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb not to mention the fact that jason alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well with the exception of chynna philips what in hell were they thinking when they cast her br br all in all i'd say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version
<START> la furia del hombre lobo forms a completely stand alone storyline which doesn't seem to fit in at all with the previous waldemar daninsky movies some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of werewolf shadow although it was released afterwards they may be right i'm not sure anyway in this movie waldemar daninsky is bitten by a yeti like creature in tibet great dialogue here it was a yeti but that's impossible i'm a scientist and these things don't exist it was a hallucination that's all and although marked with the sign of the pentagram he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted it's not long before he's resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control he is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals br br first of all jacinto molina paul naschy whatever you want to call him he's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work no matter how flawed these movies are you can always rely on him for a decent performance the rest of the cast seem good enough but it's hard to tell when they have a half assed voice over dubbed over all their lines and that was really the main problem for me many of the voice over artists they used were just awful awful awful whenever i chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines they seem to constantly refer to the hero as waldeman but unfortunately it's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of naschy movies although they're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles br br the directing of jose maria zabalza seems sort of hit and miss there are some great visual ideas in some scenes while others are badly constructed and poorly edited particularly in the final scenes when it really counts the reason for this was that zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set he allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite molina's dialogue used extras without his permission and spliced several shots from molina's earlier movies all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of molina's best works and it's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again br br but it's not all bad news as there are some good ideas here some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage the 'werewolf as a yeti' idea is one that returned in molina's later work some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar and there's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where daninsky runs from house to house through a village slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes one scene is particularly intense but it's actually lifted straight from molina's first movie la marca del hombre lobo along with a few other shots i actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining although there are some problems with the front row entertainment version such as pretty obvious cuts although some of it may simply be due to the director's lack of continuity gods knows what omissions there are i'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future br br this is a overall a decent piece of vintage naschy which experienced fans might enjoy but it could have been much better and so probably wouldn't make a great introduction
<START> my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story having read it to several of her classes it never sounded all that interesting to me though and i bought the dvd figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley br br the first half of the movie has a lot of set up and i found myself thinking that i was right it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored but curious enough to stay with it boy am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie i would most certainly watch this again br br the casting was very good since i haven't read the book i can't vouch for accuracy but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful you liked the characters you were supposed to like hated the ones you were supposed to hate and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny br br i can see how some folks might not like this movie it is tedious at times especially in the beginning all the flashbacks can be distracting though they are essential to the story once the story starts to come together at the end though i think you're paid back in spades for your patience when all is said and done i think this is a very good movie 8 10 br br
<START> 'say yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better but it never does it's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest so beloved of straight to video film makers br br the dialogue is clunky and in several places poorly translated the acting is uniformly poor especially from the villain of the piece played by joong hoon park he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple br br the plot deserves special mention as it is idiotic beyond all belief the 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them the 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her the villain gets past a police checkpoint while wearing a shirt covered in blood and a bloody head bandage by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving the villain is punched clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork but never seems to be impeded by these rather serious injuries and don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending sheesh br br the only plus point in this film for me is sang mi chu who is very pretty but really no more than a mediocre actress br br overall this film comes off like a poorly written flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos' but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved
<START> this show was absolutely great and i always look forward to watching it all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way each and every episode provided non stop laughter and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny that you couldn't help but love this show there were a few dead weight episodes but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere to where it just really didn't matter this was one of the best shows to ever be aired and i will watch this show anytime i can for it never gets old never gets unfunny and never gets uninteresting
<START> i saw this film at the adelaide film festival '07 and was thoroughly intrigued for all 106 minutes i like documentaries but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go forbidden lie powered on though never losing my interest br br the film's subject is norma khoury a jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book forbidden love a biographical story of sorts concerning a muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a christian man a few years later though a few journalists started poking holes in the story leading the public to believe it was fraud the film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning and from there we spend most of our time in the company of norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction br br director anna broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study and she conducts endless interviews with khoury as she seeks the truth as always in life the truth is not so easy to find norma fears for her life worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of jordanian muslims she refuses to return to jordan and show us the facts broinowski is not deterred however and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us br br the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist naturally what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow and ultimately we don't know whether to believe norma or not she's either a rather unfairly put upon woman trying to survive or a fantastic spinster the web of lies truths and half truths she turns through the film is brilliant br br the film uses much interview footage as well as dramatisations to tell it's story and broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like norma are able to exist we want to be conned we go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real that might just be me reading into things a bit too much it didn't come up in the q a with brionowski after the film but that's what i took away from it br br this is a great australian film and must receive an international release and a swag of awards if you ask me certainly the best film i saw at aff07 br br go see it if you get the chance
<START> i remember reading all the horrible horrible reviews for this film when it came out i meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks the only other movie to manage that is gigli br br when the movie came out on dvd i bought it to see how awful it was i couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible after seeing it i can understand br br first off let me say that this film is not without some cool shots there's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun which i thought was neat and the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at but it gets old after the first time you see it br br let me start with the worst thing in this movie tara reid if bad acting was a sin then hell would've chucked tara reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable and of all the roles she plays a curator now if she played a dumb empty headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character apparently uwe boll didn't realize that although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie people would see it he just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping i couldn't tell br br which brings me to my next complaint uwe boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie i mean i'd give house of the dead an f and i only do that for very few movies but hotd would score at least a b compared to this screwed up piece of junk the movie starts off with a very very long narration that causes immediate confusion and read by a horrible narrator and from there the cuts are really really dumb there's this one point where slater and reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out when it comes back slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly an entire army has joined them huh br br and someone did not bother checking the mistakes in this movie at one point a team breaks through glass but the glass breaks before they touch it tara reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after slater walks away from a dead comrade you can see her begin to get up br br as for the story i was really lost something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out it's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film that get quite simply boring br br i bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was i didn't laugh but i still think it's stupid very very very stupid
<START> i've seen this movie on several different occasions i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it br br type 1 old people a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest to goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences the old people walk out usually disgusted br br type 2 film snobs these people think that just because a movie bears the label of independent that it will automatically be a load of hard to follow overemotional crap that may or may not be in english yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured they are really in for a surprise when they see this film as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime inspired sword battles or the over the top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation these people will be so dismayed they will walk out a few will stay just to see how bad it will get and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends br br type 3 people expecting to see live action anime or matrix like special effects sorry folks the martial arts are pretty solid in the film but director yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing br br type 4 people with no expectations these are the people who really enjoy the film whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai picked it at random or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is entertainment this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought it was meant if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film to really kick some ass and that's what it does br br so depending on what type of person you are you may or may not enjoy this film however if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends
<START> i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first 30 minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesn't have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts br br let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the director writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directors writers who do this should be banned from the business br br if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica there's free porn on the 'net if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here
<START> the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene and yet they cannot save this movie it has so many things going against it over acting overly melodramatic poor script inconsistent direction and too few things going for it decent music good cinematography this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad please do not judge the rest based on this one film this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film
<START> i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up show off sexy models and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window with that said the bourne series has been fantastic doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly this is not the sci fi absurdity that was bond before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out with director paul greengrass taking over what could have been a second hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment the bourne ultimatum in what is an amazing conclusion to a top notch trilogy the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised br br once again bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story he is assumed to be the mole only pamela landy she who was on the case to find him in supremacy knows that he can't be the one bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer the film then becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him br br in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression this is not a detriment at all however as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight between bourne and the cia's second asset alone the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own but when they finally meet up we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see also rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films we instead get around three small scale road races just as intense but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony br br after five years of waiting we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him no one could have done it better than matt damon he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox's character from the first two films took matters into his own hands needing a role in that mold we are given a nice turn from david strathairn like cox he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing even the little guys do a wonderful job like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything albert finney as a man from bourne's past and possibly key to his origin and edgar ramirez as one of the cia's operatives sent to take bourne out ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen identity karl urban and martin csokas supremacy he doesn't talk much if at all but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino br br in the end one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them his skill at the close up hand held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott but without quite the seizure inducing cuts rather than feel like over production his use of hand held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood who shot all three bourne films he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them
<START> i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow did it turn corny or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of outdated humor it might have been funny in 1940 but not now not even close br br dick powell is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it too br br he was fine as jimmy macdonald but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters the worst being the boss raymond walburn of the maxford house coffee company who did nothing but shout all the time he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie
<START> i saw this movie at a drive in in 1959 until howard the duck i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have sired my mother the car maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it's time
<START> i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make fun of the virgin humor what a great surprise i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor ok this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother jack palance or small children the language is filthy the jokes are very crude and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere what's amazing however is that the movie is still a sweet love story my girlfriend and i both loved it steve carell is terrific but like the office the supporting cast really makes the film work all of the characters have their flaws but they also have depth and likability everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect i can't wait to get the dvd i'm sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines
<START> as a fan of paris je'taime i went to see new york i love you with very high expectations i gladly walked out with all my expectations met it was funny sweet fast paced and entertaining the film starts out with two cab hoppers bradley cooper justin bartha trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go that was funny and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones those four i will start talking about one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom thirbly's character being handicapped the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing and writing a skit about a caretaker and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker new york i love you is definitely as good if not better than the 2006 paris je'taime the skits are well paced and the film shows how indie films should really be the film however does not have as many famous directors as paris je'taime which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence if you want to laugh see some great dramatic effects see an amazing amount of great performances and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york i love you
<START> i rented this movie roughly 4 5 years ago and was instantly disappointed br br i wanted to see a b movie slasher flick but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes the acting was similar to watching grass dry i've seen better acting in a softcore film br br the idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me how was this a horror movie br br this movie's production value was laughable at best there were no scares it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas the plot was all over the place if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent skip this one there are much better b movies out there
<START> realistic movie sure except for the fact that the characters don't look like to be scared when billy zane tries to kill someone he feels bad but he doesn't look like to that's why i don't like his performance in this movie tom berenger is again playing a soldier no good thrill realistic sequences not always shooting that is one great thing well filmed i hate the helicopter sequence cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch i give it and a half out of
<START> watching beautiful women sneaking around playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy so the house on carroll street was not entirely a waste of time although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating br br there are many allusions to different hitchcock pictures not least the choice of kelly mcgillis in the starring role she is dressed up as grace kelly and she is not far off the mark not at all but her character is not convincing the way she is introduced to the audience she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period true events and a specific issue but the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run off the mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters this is all the more regrettable as the performances of the actors are good as are the photography and the set design br br the finale in central station new york is breath taking it starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture
<START> i fell in love with this silent action drama kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting todd kurt russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers br br the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born soldier not rambo not schwarzenegger not bruce willis not mel gibson not jason statham kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his original daring and all too human i miss the fact that sequels were never made br br 10 10 br br ld br br br br my faith http www angelfire com ny5 jbc33
