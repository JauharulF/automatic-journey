<START> dana andrews stands where the sidewalk ends in this 1950 film that also stars gene tierney gary merrill karl malden and neville brand andrews plays new york city detective sgt mark dixon a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects when a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster scalise merrill dixon and his partner go to investigate scalise blames the murder on ken paine stevens who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife morgan tierney but the victim dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mobster's men he goes to see paine and not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him now he must cover up the murder as a further complication he falls for morgan her father ken tully who went to paine's apartment after he saw that paine had hit his daughter is arrested for the crime br br this is a really terrific gritty noir with some good performances the ruggedly handsome and weathered andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues the movie reunites him with his fabulous laura costar gene tierney and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being roughed up little does she know she's got another one on her hands ken tully does a terrific job as her father who protests his innocence despite some damning evidence karl malden is very tough as dixon's boss br br my only problem with this well directed fast moving and absorbing film is the ending pure hollywood and putting myself in tierney's place i doubt i would react the same way a minor criticism for a film written by ben hecht and directed by otto preminger i didn't find it as awe inspiring as laura but few things in this world are if you like film noir this is a must see
<START> this tv made thriller is all talk little action it works hard to set up its convoluted plot yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best by the end i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning it has a quasi ten little indians scenario but ditches it mid way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer field overacts here with a gracelessness i've seldom seen from her the early introductions are good but the writing quickly strays off course and eventually goes over the top lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing a curious failure from producers aaron spelling leonard goldberg with all this talent couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet
<START> another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern for the forties global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon terry thomas sparkles as usual in the lead as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world ian bannen makes a great romantic lead peter sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the uber suave john le mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader lots of fun is had by all especially the viewer perhaps not in the very top echelon of ealing classics but pretty high up
<START> the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick a lame reason for akshey kumar to date 3 girls very loud over acting by both akshey and john abraham neha dupia was the highlight of the movie paresh rawal did well but not as good as his performance in hera pheri overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer save your money and don't watch this movie watch hera pheri and hungama again br br summarising it a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance the plot was extraordinarily non sense good music by preetam the man who bought us dhoom keep it up movie shot all in one room new comers female cast were okay as it was their first film but established actors like akshey and john totally disappointed an established director like priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever
<START> not as bad as you've heard there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry applegate in particular is appealing and likable as affleck's love interest james gandolfini and catherine o'hara are consummate professionals they're pretty good in just about everything in the end surviving is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see br br unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced the attempts at dark humor come off as dour affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed his character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and o'hara's more muted believable performances even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the set up of affleck renting this family for x mas br br there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness the x mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother that not only isn't funny or believable but disturbing br br to make matters worse the colors in this film are muddy almost noirish the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap br br surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds paycheck gigli jersey girl and this for affleck it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be
<START> i grew up baptist and i know the story this movie is trying to tell although i no longer believe the story i'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average lifetime movie of the week mildly interesting mediocre acting a bit slow the script is predictable the music is sappy and it is a bit melodramatic and all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non christians ever not a single curse word from any of them but i laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the united nations pronounced nuclear as nu cu ler just like bush is there some christian code of honor that mandates that since bush claims he too is called by god that all christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does lol i really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that after the nu cu ler incident the movie began to feel like packaged manipulative propaganda i was looking for something bold actually i was looking for something that might make me think but i didn't find it here if you're looking for mindless entertainment stop here it's good for killing a rainy afternoon but if you're looking for intelligence look elsewhere
<START> colorful western br br wyoming cowboy james stewart moseys on up to the yukon territory to dig for gold sell his steers and try to get a date with pretty saloon owner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants stewart's cattle beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniels good technicolor adventure from universal international directed by anthony mann br br also starring corinne calvet connie gilchrist and walter brennan as stewart's sidekick
<START> ok plain and simple if you are a fan of the other tomb raider games yes even aod keep away from legend br br it is without doubt the most disappointing tr game yet it looks very nice it sounds very nice but it is totally unplayable and i've given up i feel like i've been robbed by eidos br br it's very simple tr was a pc game before anything else you control lara using the keyboard in 6 tomb raider games the controls were standard in aod they were 'tacky' but still the same general control sequences in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable br br i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'use the mouse' no why should i others say 'use a gamepad' no why should i others say 'but this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' well i don't care it is not the standard for any other tr game so why mess with it oh i know because they couldn't care less about their original loyal fan base they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money pathetic br br my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game and if you do buy it complain to eidos i have seen masses of other posts mainly on the eidos forums from people telling them how rubbish it is perhaps they will listen
<START> i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television since then i have never missed an episode br br it's humour is very weird like a cross between brass eye's social commentary the fast show's excellent one liners and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere the best example of this was hillary briss's special stuff what was that all about br br the humour will not appeal to all some will say it's just too sick and it's easy to see where they're coming from nonetheless give it a try if you don't like it don't watch it but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice
<START> once again disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names the most glaring errors are the characters penny does not have her book brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop dr claw is more a show off than an evil villain etc but there are more than that the horrors start from the first minutes of the film having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman they introduce brenda who only serves to make this movie disney compatible add to this the fact that the claw seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be a better storyline to replace it but as you guessed disney failed in that too the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduced the new gadgetmobile it doesn't look function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all it's just the canonical comic relief figure disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy so they made the film a comedy too but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the chief's face and replaced them with gadget being a moron the gadgetmobile being a wise ass and claw showing off someone should tell disney that children's movie doesn't imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be targeted for children of 10 12 years not children of 10 12 months like this movie whatever this movie is supposed to be it is not repeat not the real inspector gadget because i love the old gadget i hate this
<START> saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don't get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleep br br the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug after 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all br br i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny
<START> spoiler this movie is based on the concept of what if of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question the main character goes through a bad day like many of us and asks this question chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game this event sets into motion one's destiny just like ashton in the butterfly effect except mr destiny uses comedy over drama the results make a fresh somewhat original movie if one's philosophical are in tune with the butterfly effect one will likely enjoy mr destiny i give it a 7 out of 10 amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie 3 times and finally watched the ending on tbs
<START> i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it i was very moved by this movie i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault as in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with leo who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gays i am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others the only part of the movie i couldn't understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include marcel in leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral br br i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex
<START> i am a huge horror splatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a point br br after reading the other people's reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films i've ever watched br br the acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this case br br i waisted 11 eur to get this dvd br br unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sh t films avoid at any cost
<START> well the movie was a fun watch the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by like vampires that walk in the sunlight though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ow this hurts it's really stuck then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while and there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot come to think of it nothing really made sense but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful and the zombies were just fun to watch slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more but you know all in all you can't expect schindlers list but its a fun watch
<START> wonderful film one of the best horror films of the 70s she is realistic settings and atmospheres as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here br br before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment in the film a good gift because 10 is really well done raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films he really impression excellent film really i consider a film anthology of years'70
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey lohan br br after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the f k br br without giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a spoiler br br spoiler alert spoiler alert at the end of the movie it rains i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie
<START> if you love the thin man series you will love this movie powell's character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs br br the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn't half bad
<START> well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and sad and yes the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery i think my mum would like it i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f kers club though
<START> i'll say one thing about this film there are no lulls you can't get bored watching this the problem is that it is too intense there is too much action and it needs lulls that is the risk you take in modern action films you want it interesting but not overdone this is way overdone br br even though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in gary busey and roy scheider it still has the feel of a b film the best part of it is scheider's dialog the only a part of this b film br br the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines that was memorable not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long
