<START> jon voight plays a man named joe joe is shook up by a haunting childhood he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people he meets a misfit named ratso dustin hoffman and the two for a relationship they go out and work together in helping each other out they become thieves the two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other however there is something very important that ratso hasn't told joe and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together this is one of the greatest films ever made it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other their story is devastating to watch but is ultimately important for people to see it's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street the difference is that this film is from their perspective their lives are shown to us and it's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt especially if we at one time were one of those people however the film doesn't try to guilt trip you instead it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty gritty and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 and it has stood the test of time perfectly today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 the film was rated x but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest realistic and effective way anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous awkward and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy a clockwork orange greetings last tango in paris and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy they are not graphic but they are realistic and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film the course language that is used in the film particularly the word fag is used effectively and is not gratuitous the violence is very shocking to watch even today but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler i'm really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 if not more i can't recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten br br pros br br jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual you'll forget who is playing them within minutes br br beautiful score br br not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today br br fantastic and fast editing job br br cons br br for mature audiences only br br the opening scenes are well done but they could be just a little stronger
<START> another channel 4 great canned long before it's time compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast sexy intelligent and funny i remember watching it at the time and even then asking around no one had really heard of it but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder perhaps channel 4 don't do their job well enough in drumming up the enthusiasm needed either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother i suspect the latter downloading of garth merengie's dark place prompted channel 4 to release a dvd of that series let's hope the same can happen with north square
<START> if you enjoy films like american pie road trip van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an unamusing mean spirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers easily the worst film i have seen in the past 18 months mind numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it's runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned
<START> being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created br br for example there's a reference to woerner's restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerner's restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts br br no surprise because the script was co authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film br br a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside city hall itself br br al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself he's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained for br br danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal he's very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in br br city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he's on br br al pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he's a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york br br for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended
<START> as we all know hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies for example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the lapd yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice another example is the number of lapd officers who were shot near the end of the movie this is far from the truth but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they add some more blood and guts some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain i guess the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentaries about the north hollywood shootout on tlc that were far better then this
<START> i find this movie very enjoyable the plot is simple and easily digestible the humour is light and clean and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out turns out to be very nice the performance of the female lead is admirable her portrayal of an innocent naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming i also find vera's dancing very very well done i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly br br for those who have had enough of profanity filled movies of today you will enjoy this movie thoroughly
<START> i thought this movie was terrible i'm chinese so i thought everything was totally wrong many of the facts were incorrect the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded shihuangdi i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake many of the actors and actresses were not very great some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie mulan was quite accurate watch this movie if you want to waste some time
<START> i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton's james bond and although it wasn't his deserved '3rd bond outing' it was a laugh belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely but was probably underused his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men the other brit in it was a bit shocking but overal it was a laugh
<START> i just watched i q again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with einstein playing twinkle twinkle little star on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career an especially unique situation for the 1950's the time in which this movie is set i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber it's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance a clinical behavioral researcher the message to me is that we are not what we do but who we are is defined by so much more no labels there are so many little gags and one liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully br br i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium there are 3 instruments protractor ruler etc hanging on the right from the chalk ledge in the next camera shot there only 2 in the credits on our video it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb br br i highly recommend this movie it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations but has lots more substance than many give it credit for not only that what a great cast is assembled here watch it and enjoy
<START> but it's worth watching for boyer lorre and paxinou greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores as in this gun for hire or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit bacall fits that part here i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman but listen to the dialogue no people don't talk that way except in books but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world one other positive note greene's range of characters were kept whole while mr mukerjee resembled more a brahamin at least his nationality was kept and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless
<START> i have seen and liked the original film and expected more from a remake than this br br good effects and makeup are good no complaints about the score and visuals they are adequate and the performances were okay tim roth was excellent the other principals were fine and a handful of the supporting supporting actors did very well with extremely limited roles the action scenes were exciting and fun br br bad the escape from the ape city was terrible the characters are going in circles then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape plus what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom br br the story was pared down to include as much action as possible i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect br br finally the ending was completely nonsensical as presented without seeing the inevitable sequel there is no justification for it br br
<START> the waterdance 1991 the main character of the waterdance played by eric stoltz finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured and there he must face an harsh new life confined to a wheelchair it's an interesting and promising premise but unfortunately it fails to deploy what ensues instead is largely hollywood schmaltz with some interesting moments certainly the cast eric stoltz william forsythe wesley snipes et al is brilliant and perform well here as one would expect but their talents are wasted the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable the snipes character being the exception i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being crippled or weak by depicting them for the most part as in your face pricks but it makes for an entirely annoying experience admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through in a way that is not softened or romanticized which is useful and a good idea but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with and that's worth dealing with it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be to varying degrees despicable they wouldn't have to be disneyfied either surely there's a middle ground somewhere by the film's conclusion the eric stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end we couldn't care less br br in addition to its character problems the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from the syndrome doesn't really have an official name but you might call it inexplicable forgiveness syndrome it goes something like this characters abuse the crap out of each other and then without so much as an apology all is forgiven an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot as a resultÂthey love him in one of the the latest examples spiderman 3 supervillain the sandman lays waste to a chunk of manhattan then wails on spiderman for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to bye now the most egregious example of ifs in the waterdance is a sequence in which after being called the n word by william forsythe's racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene the wesley snipes character whoops it up with the same forsythe character in the next scene as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence again without so much as an oh yeah sorry about that business back there where i you know called you the n word it makes me wonder do these people actually watch these movies before they release them or do they just film them with their eyes closed kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number and call it a day's work
<START> i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times in addition i'm also shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter however after watching it i was extremely disappointed br br the movie's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous the director lingered on certain scenes for much too long there was no passion or chemistry between the lovers there was barely any dialogue dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting at the end of the movie you didn't feel any compassion for the characters this movie was lacking in everything the script was weak the acting was poor and the editing was non existent the director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably a good movie is one in which captures your attention maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by this movie felt as though it would never end don't waste your money on this movie
<START> let's face it if you rented a stdvd sequel of a forgotten 80's gem and expected it to be better than the aforementioned then you are an idiot wargames the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily movies like this don't need spoilers because you already know them br br the plot for this film is as follows nerd meets girl girl likes nerd nerd likes girl nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer nerd and girl go to another country nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the film nerd and girl are captured the top secret government computer gets crazy nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first wargames film nerd saves the day nerd gets laid br br the end br br the acting script effects score and cinematography are what you would expect b grade some familiar faces are in here and unless you are a mega fan of colm feore then you should avoid this one granted the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it so if you like cheap looking stdvd sequels then you are right at home br br sadly mathew broderick was too involved with some masterpiece that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one but can you blame him
<START> the first episode i saw of lost made me think i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but it's not like that it's far more than that because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost well it's getting better every time a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed that's the real secret br br this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters this series deserves a 9 out of 10
<START> ok the box looks promising whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes supposed to be a comedy and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending this movie has the following elements a battered and abused next door neighbor a boring legal trial racisim talk of lynchings and death and arson hilarious huh no please if you never listen to anyone's reviews please do here you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap crap i said it crap whoever put there name on this should indeed sue
<START> i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes br br of course it went completely the other way let's be cool and edgy and came out the other side with little to show for it i bet one small seed went nuts for this i know sl did br br none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off even danny k had better timing i'm actually being serious every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking darn this person should have been the lead br br independent doesn't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible black and white did nothing for this movie actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief the black and white also wasn't crisp the composition was horrible the use of music was horrible strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb maybe that's why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind br br i think corne who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything was speaking to this movie and not david see it and you'll understand i bet the guys who organise oppikoppi were dismayed one would think nothing happens there at all i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone's back garden i know regular guys who have much funnier raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these comics the dude who they hooked up with end was ok though br br guess sa comedy's gonna stay in the stone age a little longer nice work guys
<START> after all these years of peter o'tool's brilliant costly giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood tosses him an oscar recently br br country dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged life how does he do it br br york again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological battleships loaded for bear br br bravo to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the nazi's lost to these irish scot english blends brutal honesty hurts back in the 70's when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have modified my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and others br br forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes
<START> no spoilers br br being a david lynch film one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do but it is a very straight story as the title might hint don't except to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i e lost highway it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect it's innovative because it so not lynch but maybe that is lynch he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself being a very avantgarde director he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn't give it to them that would be crafty br br the pace of the film is slow i would almost say lawn mower speed don't expect an action orgy but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life and listen to badalamenti's score and the main theme that really animates the iowa and wisconsin landscapes shown frequently br br farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film he doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts his cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination need i say that his weak health in this film wasn't acted he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth br br all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done one could ask for homilies that aren't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn't ruin the overall picture being that it is a memorable motion picture 9 10
<START> a well intentioned movie about sonja horowitz renÃ©e zellweger the wife of devout talmudic scholar mendel glenn fitzgerald who is deeply unhappy mendel's brother sender christopher eccleston sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she's already an expertÂjewelry he also starts an affair with her and then when she spends time with a puerto rican artist he dumps her and betrays her to the family which shuts her out there's a subplot in which sonja's dead brother talks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman but why is not clear much is not clear unfortunately including what is going on with sonja why she tells the rebbe there's a fire inside her and maybe it's not from god and what this means and what the magical beggar woman tells her means to an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra orthodox community and yet sonja is not exactly liberated nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well thought out the title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good womanÂand yet it's the bastard sender who quotes it to sonja zellweger struggles with the part she's supposed to be a jew from the mid west and sometimes her accent is flat and at other times it's taken on the characteristic sounds of brooklyn she's at her best when she's being tough and taking charge but ultimately the movie's a mess
