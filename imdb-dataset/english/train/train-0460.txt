<START> don't know how this missed award nominations great film certainly of the calibre of beautiful mind great acting photography script and drama i can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film
<START> predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout it's looooooong eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd like jonathan ross' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show '
<START> dick tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by chester gould he is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as flattop to the blank to big boy caprice these villains became so popular in the 40's that warner bros created their own take on the tracy style villains in such cartoons as daffy duck tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up to date technology advances notably the wristwatch communicator which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie the music was done wonderfully by danny elfman and the original songs by madonna were interesting but they were not the high point for her career it's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments the film feels so much like batman because of elfman's memorable sound to his pieces br br i love the tough talking kid pacino's acting as big boy caprice and that chin madonna's take on villainy and the cinematography and directing were impeccable this film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made warren beatty al pacino william forsythe dustin hoffman kathy bates mandy patinkin catherine o'hara dick van dyke the film was directed by beatty himself which was interesting it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part br br i had to give this film an 8 10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked for whatever reason there have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on imdb and i still don't understand why the characters were completely original and vibrant as was the style of the sets wardrobe lighting and everything in this film go buy it today you will not be sorry
<START> the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h g wells' great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century 1900 Â using wells' original setting in and near woking england br br imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature so let's get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no immunity if that's a spoiler so be it after a book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this ends br br this film which follows wells' plot in the main is also very cleverly presented Â in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th early 20th century photography although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didn't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on Â as you'll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s Â and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward Â such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair br br this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells' original narrative Â as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells' description of the martians Â a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles Â is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england Â plus a few scenes in london involving the narrator's brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark big ben but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of london br br the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate Â who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery british curates are so often utterly insufferable br br this film lasts almost 3 hours going through wells' story in welcome detail it's about time the author got his due Â in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact a word about the acting don't expect award winning performances they're not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman Â also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by w bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by james lathrop in his first film br br this is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors if you want to see h g wells' war of the worlds Â and not some wholly distorted version of it Â see this film
<START> a true classic beautifully filmed and acted reveals an area of paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy although the area of 'hotel du nord' and the hotel itself still exists it is not as gay in the original sense of the word and joyful as it once must have been the film makes one yearn for the past which has been lost with a sigh and bittersweetness
<START> i'll start by relating my first encounter with prince's music it was in a bar on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to 1999 playing on the speakers i asked people who is this singer i was told it was prince it was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful topless dancer later i started hearing other prince songs and really digging them when purple rain came out i still knew very little about this fellow minnesotan the movie blew me away i instantly became prince's no 1 fan of the war baby generation later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary and she got me and my nephew into a v i p prince concert where we sat next to his mother how cool is that getting back to the topic at hand i agree with siskel ebert who called purple rain an instant classic i have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it i thought prince's acting was fine apollonia struggled a bit but all in all the acting was fine john gielgud was not available to play 'the kid' so prince took the role the film is visually stunning brilliantly paced it never gets slow and terrifically directed i rank it among the best movie musicals of all time the last time i watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered i am so proud of fellow minnesotan prince rogers nelson and would love to tell him personally he walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said hi to my nephew but not me he was chatting with his mom i was a bit crushed but he's still no 1 with me
<START> i mean of all the obscure overlooked low budget horror movies waiting to be re discovered in a dvd release why pick the forest i love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror i love 80s hacker horror i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased murdered and eaten by psychopaths i am all for the idea of non professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one i am all for using found public locations non actors no name talent behind the camera and in the studio no problem the most evocative image from the forest is it's opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods we see them as tiny vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator then the film takes a dive never recovers we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked they get separated both are butchered and then we meet the movie's protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks br br this film is too slow this movie is too boring and this movie is too talky which wouldn't be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid asinine and unnecessary things you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods and speaking of these woods they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it there are impressive shots of the forest primeval but no real sense of being out in the middle of it if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by br br what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest i don't know who these couples are and don't care what happens to them the hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend who just happens to seek shelter in his cave the irony of which is the epitome of underwhelming coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people's movements a lack of appreciable gore nudity lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn't even as frightening as a pbs educational tv show about how magnets work br br i don't mean to dish it out to the people behind this film since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife there is nothing wrong with that concept what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn't much to command a repeat screening hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release it was fine as a prism video rental years oddity as a dvd it will be 5 99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves there is little or no urgency to see the film unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there here is a guide of steps to avoid making br br with all that said and done the film did have one interesting sequence or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut dried film the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor he dispatches his beloved arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper the guy corners and attacks his quarry who sidesteps runs away only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger badder weapon the psycho attacks again and the guy gets away the psycho materializes again and once more the guy gets away then again finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption how did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that is there some supernatural element to this psycho since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma staged to build some tension it's purpose remains unclear the whole film is like that really existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham fisted uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was br br 3 10 and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn't mean you necessarily should
<START> this movie joshua is extremely disturbing and downright pointless it actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister and that is just the tip of the iceberg during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable adding insult to injury by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults there is no redemption no justice served and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them frankly i did not enjoy watching this movie it was extremely unsettling even for those who might enjoy horror movies this movie could be too much despite the fact this movie was well acted the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure
<START> as others have mentioned this movie is similar to the fly both versions and the lesser known sci fi flick altered states the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it metamorphosis did not have these advantages metamorphosis is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles br br the story follows scientist dr peter houseman gene lebrock an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death when the university he works for threatens to cut funding he decides to inject the anti aging serum into himself as a result dr houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard and oh yes watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy it really is so bad that it's good some of the lines are classic what was it a nightmare from the past br br many of the reviews that i've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are i'm just going to go ahead and spoil it the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half man half lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected godzilla costume when the police finally gun him down in the final scene some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die and the movie's heroine sally donnelly catherine baranov evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of dr houseman the camera then gives us a close up of the lizard's face this is i assume the director's way of showing us that the lizard is evil yes it is goofy but i fell over laughing so i can't complain br br i watched this movie because it was a part of the chilling classics 50 movie megapack that i purchased i'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on dvd if you have recently bought the boxed set and haven't watched this movie yet it really is worth your time even if i did just ruin the ending for you it might also be possible to find this movie online for free
<START> although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress prostitute mildred rogers this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole the acting is indeed fine in most every respect what i cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why phillip a sensitive well bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects yes i know he is a sensitive club footed introverted intellectual but davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable davis is astounding in her role yes she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then but it's a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it too bad she wasn't playing a gangster's moll her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low lifes
<START> oh my gosh i live in kentucky and when mellisa joan hart came to louisville she went right through my neighborhood and waved at me i am filthy rich so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and i love being rich any ways she came for the derby back to my interest in the show that show makes you want to point your finger at something and make it disappear i mean it is just so creative and i love it i would love to be on that show that show is just amazing i mean who ever came up with that show i want to just give them a big kiss i mean it makes me feel better when i'm sick and makes me happy when i'm mad i mean if someone tells me they don't like it i will talk some sense in to you ok ok
<START> the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something he uses his new found invisibility to torment tom and it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one joke cartoon and the action never leaves the interior of the house which is usually the trait of below average t j shorts still worth a 7 10 br br however i'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself
<START> spoilers br br while the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time br br i have two complaints 1 it's too short and 2 the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 5 10
<START> the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous the plot is awful but on the plus side the acting is pretty good with a few good shouts and rants sharon stone is ok this time not even half as good as the original mind you the murders aren't as gory as the first one either which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake they are fully clothed the script is weak most of the time but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and washburn are highlights the plot twists a few times but the ending is awful the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'oh my god ' the chase sequences are brilliantly directed and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rush felt film sharon stone is a bit old for this too the bits where we see her breasts were in the first one delights this time around they are too horrid to describe the films its self is rather average but it is worth a go mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz with the opening sequence being a highlight not to be critical but if you liked the first one leave this one don't ruin the run you'll be glad you left this stone unturned
<START> this is the worst show buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing even sesame street has better humor and more adult than friends friends may be the worst thing i've ever seen on television and i've been sitting in front of the tube observing friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the smartness of seinfeld and the wonderful self ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of frasier the characters in friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl br br the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric though intentionally so it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends
<START> what a terrible movie rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too don't be fooled by the positive comments it wasn't scary it wasn't funny it wasn't clever it won't even hold your attention i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap fest the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained the dialogue was terrible must be a translation thing another negative that stood out was the idiot americans 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character intelligence and judgment now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter
<START> this movie is a cringe fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot but it is so much fun to watch everything about it is hilarious the basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co worker who is intent on destroying them all they catch up with him in the year 1146 the 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed the actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth shakers like i double checked everything twice he double checked everything twice he checked it four times not only that but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part when roger corman ran out of money and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets the medieval set is a comic mish mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century any costume they could find they used i guess chain mail wasn't on the budget 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor the fight scenes are laughable with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast it sounds truly awful but i enjoy it every time i watch it the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous b movie that if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks i would suggest you see and once you have read the review on unknown movies i love hearing them point out all the funny truly awful bits in the movie
<START> i've seen many horror shows over the years like nightstalker that dealt with the wendigo legend so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season man was i mistaken the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property ve ery scary not this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor another total loser br br it's getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made go back to the drawing board fellas and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around
<START> when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent boy was i wrong i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li it's truly embarrassing depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible being a batman fan since my boyhood i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost because it doesn't project the true image of batman this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s t get batman the animates series and don't waste your time with this cartoon
<START> how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick on the field action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine inning shutout what's next major league 4 return to the little league ehh could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all star game this one's had three strikes too many
