<START> spoilers alert br br homeward bound the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4 year old scamp the story is based on the sheila burnford novel and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone br br the basic story two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are though the young and happy go lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical due in part to his voice over explaining his being abandoned as a pup picked up to an animal shelter and being bought by the family though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling br br the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness fantastic wilderness settings by the way driven on by shadow's instincts of direction they meet several perils along the way hoping to make it home while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance there are funny moments all the way through great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines see memorable quotes and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling punctuated by moments of sadness such as when sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers br br somehow though i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story br br the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg finds it hard to get out and gives up exhausted followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily br br the way that this scene brilliantly done isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home but shadow is nowhere to be seen then just as all seems lost he slowly appears and is reunited with the family chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown but also how the other two have as well hang on a second i think i'm going to cry br br anyway i haven't read sheila burnford's book so i don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie but this is a film that all the family can watch and while the tots will love the talking animals older viewers will understand the plot line better as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it this film is a masterpiece in cinema and i suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it br br and please avoid the sequel see my review for homeward bound ii
<START> what did i just watch i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre i still am wondering how the character mark wasn't able to run away from the clown he's 300 pounds he's gotta get tired eventually the whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud what did i just watch apparently brandon is denise's cousin and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin yeah that's something people want so see shudders br br another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says what did you do well bytch what do you think he just did the last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch hiker and calling her a c nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence isn't helping anything did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy none of this movie makes sense anyway br br the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying all 3 99 and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes i'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy would have fit right in i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have but i was wrong this is a moronic piece of garbage that's not even worth watching br br 1 out of 10
<START> i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable i can see why it hasn't been rebroadcast anytime recently more specifically this mini has some serious problems such as br br 1 it is terribly miscast the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters ali mcgraw 45 at the time was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 jan michael vincent 39 at the time was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22 the other henry children and pamela tudsbury were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's br br 2 some of the acting was absolutely awful ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays br br 3 the directing was poor to be fair to ali mcgraw the bad acting and character development were probably the directing the portrayal of hitler was way overdone his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic sometimes charming but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel some of the other characters are done so stereotypically berel jastrow they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them br br 4 this mini is very dated the hokey music the pretentious narration it sounded like a junior high school history film narration and the entire prime time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times also too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939 br br someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all because it will come off more as a late 70's early 80's take myself too seriously prime time soap drama rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic br br remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning memorable and critically acclaimed production i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long 15 hours or longer to do it right and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public it wouldn't fly
<START> midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song 'everybody's talking' starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish anaconda is a source of pleasure br br the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowd pleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably 'real' it was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters rang true it was also the first 'x' rated film to win the oscar as the year's best picture adapted brilliantly by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main stream commercial american movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug taking in a matter of fact manner everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically voight's joe buck is an innocent abroad a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little con man called 'ratso' rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and he's a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe dream br br essentially it's a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other voight with his physical prowess hoffman with his street wise savvy they are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others though 'straight' voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself the whole film posits a strangely 'christian' attitude br br it's also magnificently acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers on beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye view of the american under belly without rancor and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
<START> this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead
<START> i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many but this was simply not a very good attempt its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original have not seen and doubt i will it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance character from its supposed male lead jimmy fallon br br fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that he's supposed to be a teacher you see and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot not fallon who is neither funny nor an actor but appears to think he is both not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role or believe that there is any way these two people should or would be together near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone its hard to have a one person romance tells fallon that its over too much has happened and she's moving on and rather than feeling bad about the scene or sorry for fallon you are actively cheering her on finally she does what she should have done months ago but of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else
<START> i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site but i will defend this film br br the dentist is actually a really good film the acting isn't always top notch but the thrills are good and the story's good plus you see linda hoffman's boobies not that i'm an expert in this field but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense corbin makes a great creepy dentist it does to dentists what jaws does to sharks ish it obviously had a fairly limited budget but they did well with it what they could and developed the characters well those that count br br the end
<START> jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth but this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today jake's closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense a horror movie for the thinking person if you're looking for a slasher movie this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you at the screening i saw i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed i highly recommend catching this film
<START> paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film i've ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking person's nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all br br in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come br br it's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way br br and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away br br add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express br br
<START> japan is in serious trouble demons have infested edo taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will on top of that the rebirth of ashura queen of the demons is nigh the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon wardens a fearsome group of warriors who might just be as bad as the demons themselves br br izumo is a retired demon warden who five years ago took up theater instead of demon slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child in a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from dusk till dawn one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named tsubaki their fortunes intertwine literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies br br if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasy swordplay epic you'd be wrong in fact there's nothing typical about ashura it is a hodge podge of many different genre's of film those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance director yojiro takita onmyoji juggles the genre's fairly respectfully although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie br br to be sure there are flaws in the film some of the humor seems contrived and out of place and the acting isn't the greatest but seriously do you watch fantasy swordplay comedy films for the great acting performances no we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals all of which ashura has in spades not to be misleading the film is not all action but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy br br bottom line the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick br br my rating 7 out of 10 fun popcorn movie
<START> this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart wrenching listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming and seeing him smile was indescribable i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant please if you ever have a chance to watch this film consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy
<START> i've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and that's why i was slightly disappointed i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth watching br br the subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another however the acting of jeon do yeon is incredibly beautiful it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role
<START> i wouldn't normally write a comment on line but this is the worst movie i've ever seen not only that it's filmed just like a soap series the young and the restless is really filmed by professionals compared to this but it also has awful cuts it has no action it is full of useless garbage br br here's an example a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him so after loads of crap here they are the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like you're dead now then the main character says if you kill me you're dead i've told the police you're threatening me so the killer guy goes like just about to cry oh no the cops are following me oh my god br br remember this is just an example i really cannot believe this movie actually exists so if you want to see the worst movie ever go ahead i recommend it
<START> when i heard about hammerhead being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store i thought well just another cheap monster movie from nu image those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies so i didn't expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing shark zone just a few days before but hammerhead turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies we have a mad scientist a group of people in a dangerous situation screaming women and damsels in distress man eating plants and of course we have the creature a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark everything you need for an entertaining monster movie the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing and it doesn't matter anyway cause hammerhead is action and horror entertainment at it's best there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points though first of all the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done and secondly william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the hero part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo other than that i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn watch this movie and have fun jasper p morgan
<START> a sequel to actually a remake of disney's 1996 live action remake of 101 dalmations cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr pavlov ugh but the cure is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides br br this movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that it's a thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over over over over acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end i hope they gave her an extremely large paycheck br br speaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building as you do in the climax of this film of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the macaulay culkin's of this movie pulling all the stupid home alone gags on the villains biting them in the crotch running over their hands with luggage carts squirting them with icing etc etc etc ad nauseum i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors much better than the humans br br gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked out french furrier the two human dog lovers rehashed from the earlier film but with different actors are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please don't go there i half expected the humans to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene as charlie sheen did in hot shots part deux doing the spaghetti strand kiss pushing the meatball with his nose etc br br and don't get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idle's voice br br the costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie are good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck
<START> i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas l'engle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l'engle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don't see this movie if you are a big fan of l'engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie
<START> we first watched this film as part of a festival of new argentine films in 2000 at the walter reade although we liked it we didn't think it was extraordinary watching it for a second time we found a different meaning in this look at life in buenos aires br br the film takes place in one of the darkest days of argentina as the delarua administration was ending the country was in turmoil after the economy which had flourished earlier in the 1990s under the artificially climate president menen created it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare br br the story begins just as santamarina a bank employee is fired because the collapse of the economy instead of receiving sympathy from his wife she locks him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes becomes a homeless man he takes to the streets trying to make ends meet br br the other story introduces us to ariel a young jew interviewing for a job in a spanish company it's almost a miracle he gets the job his father simon owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of el once in the center of the city things go from bad to worse when ariel's mother dies suddenly only estela the young woman who is in love with ariel comes to help father and son br br santamarina who is a clean man has to resort to take showers wherever he can he chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations when the attendant elsa finds him naked she becomes furious but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times they become romantically involved and santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage finds an infant elsa while surprised wants to do the right thing but santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love br br ariel who has met the gorgeous laura at work begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co worker who unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions feels a passion for laura but he realizes what estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him br br daniel burman whose el abrazo partido we thought was excellent did wonders with this film things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around if anything this second time the nuances of the screen play mr burman and emiliano torres wrote make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days br br daniel hendler who plays ariel has collaborated with mr burman before to surprising results he is not 'movie star pretty' yet he is handsome this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work enrique pineyro is another magnificent surprise his santamarina is disarming in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets stefania sandrelli the interesting italian actress makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa hector alterio one of the best argentine actors plays the small part of simon the gorgeous chiara coselli is seen as laura and melina petrielli appears as the noble estela br br esperando al mesias proves daniel burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the argentine cinema
<START> lol delirious was so funny i was in tears eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on the best impression was of james brown and mr t so funny its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny i have seen it 6 7 times and still pee myself every time this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from he does impressions of his family as well which is real funny br br if only i was there
<START> this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvd br br television moved out of my life in 1981 so i never followed the series or any part of it which means that i'm immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers br br possible spoiler warning br br the pilot of moonlighting is your basic caveman meets fluffball yarn where a charming red blooded he man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs the premises that the script's wit is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 it also contains some frankly bad writing as in the scene where maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance br br i often feel that susan faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment but in this particular case i'm all with her moonlighting has backlash stamped all over it br br in one sense however this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans in addition to the pilot episode it contains the screen test that landed willis the job both features show to what amazing extent willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988 89 die hard 1 in country impressive br br rating and i am a bruce willis fan 2 out of 10
<START> this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen i haven't seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clichÃ©s and the story doesn't ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don't think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good
