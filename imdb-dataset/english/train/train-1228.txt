<START> it was supposed to be the last freddy movie and it was for over 10 years you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done but they turned out giving us the worst of the series and that's saying a lot the plot made no sense i seriously can't remember it all the main characters were idiots you really wanted them dead and freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual the only remotely good bit about this was a brief and funny cameo by johnny depp the first nightmare movie was his first br br also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section reaccounting freddy's childhood was in 3 d well the 3 d was lousy faded colors and the image going in and out of focus also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary i think had the opposite reaction from my audience everybody broke down laughing looks even worse on tv in 2 d pointless and stupid very dull also skip this one and see freddy vs jason again
<START> this is a poor film by any standard the story in match point had a certain intrigue and the direction and writing a certain fascination woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it br br scoop however has none of this it is poorly written the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie ups why are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked rooms br br allen's delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres curse of the jade scorpion purple rose of cairo etc have given us so much pleasure over the years even hollywood ending had a great central idea sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time
<START> for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like dark remains br br we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film br br while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares br br the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to it's creepiness br br i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if you're sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won't regret it
<START> this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoir faire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of high falutin' european terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems well chosen for their roles br br the story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco all in all there's little not to like about this film very well worth the time to watch it
<START> i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch i am so glad i saw it and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time this movie is so wonderful it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe br br the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are some people have said this is a kids movie i disagree it may be made by disney and many characters are children but i am 23 and i loved it there were moments when my spine tingled the story is unlike any other film these days full of adventure i have just ordered the book from amazon can't wait
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that's never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates bandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you're one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans don't bother with this one
<START> this can't be mandy schaffer's last film somebody do something br br argh br br what little life this one might have had the directing finished off don't blame the cast they did ok even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through and please please put mandy in some more movies she's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age ya' breakin' my haht heah br br two specific criticisms in case anyone cares apparently nobody liked this movie very much first the way traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives it's dumb write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more if your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it br br second carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that traci pulled she already had traci fingered more bad writing directing there br br i could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it actually i didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have it just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy one or the other of us needs glasses and i don't think it's me br br more mandy not to be confused with moore mandy although i'd like to see her again too br br p s did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies d
<START> the goofy griswalds win the t v game show pig in a poke grand prize and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another of all the ridiculous unfunny money spinning sequels this one beats the lot harold ramis' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish vacation across the states this time amy heckerling look who's talking helms what turns out to be a disastrous comedy which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh br br hughes script with rob klane is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead beat project as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining br br yet as inconceivable as it may seem european vacation was successful enough to warrant a second sequel surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one you know i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother br br monday december 26 1994 t v
<START> yes the plot is hardly plausible and very thin yes the acting does range from average to laughable yes it has been done so many times before however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be a scary funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none
<START> i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films girl 6 donnie brasco and don't really remember her but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy br br she really didn't think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her religion again br br the photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography david strathairn good night and good luck played a super part here br br mary harron american psycho wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever
<START> the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world when war finally does arrive it's ravages continue not for another five years but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the wandering sickness a pestilence that continues for another four years br br things to come balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization the wings over the world concept plays out a bit corny though it's spokesman cabal raymond massey is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause if he fails others will follow this message is continually reinforced throughout the film brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindset br br the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon but in 1936 a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 br br things to come is one of those rarities in film a picture that makes you think which side will you come down on the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo it's not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control
<START> phantasm class phantasm ii awesome phantasm iii erm terrible br br even though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply can't the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start something the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid who is a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls erm not gonna work or rather shouldn't and the blooming zombies what the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there is a severe lack of midgets running about br br the only good bits are the cracking start and of course reggie b br br possible spoiler coming up br br to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv br br overall very very disappointing 3 10
<START> i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance' bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' bilal didn't take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here well there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only pretentiousness this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'van helsing' look like live actors and since half the characters are cgi animated it is quite a problem that the cgi effects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal's a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie
<START> i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the ambient background music Â which really sets the mood of the film Â it lacks almost all the qualities that i've come to associate with lynch's work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest br br this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director i've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though i'm watching one of davids home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends
<START> another movie to suffer without an adventure to run no enigma to solve just an illness man acting like an animal no a good reason to take this journey pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance
<START> this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes weren't funny actors weren't funny anything about it wasn't even remotely funny don't waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives and molly shannon who i'm sure tried her best but the script was just too awful that's why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but it's definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> an imagination is a terrible thing to waste especially when you have talented actors writer director jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist br br anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry we've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man's head these are only snippets of what's in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
<START> this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club beyond that it features a truly bad script with dull unrealistic dialogue that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking
<START> this is a so called 'feel good' movies however it made me sad in a way why because i had the talent but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer br br and soccer is the red line in this movie together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have an english indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy and plays soccer a combination which worries her mother this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people as well as the indian community in england it is about believe in your dreams and live your one life where did we hear that before br br paraminder nagra a beautiful women plays yasminda a girl who is not interested in boys new clothes make up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff in contradiction with her sister pinky complete the opposite of yasminda br br a real must it is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and finds her luck eventually with great music from blondie curtis mayfield texas melanie c as well as indian hit songs br br pleasant to watch but if you as myself ever played soccer and never made it to the top then this movie will make you melachonic
<START> this tim burton remake of the original planet of the apes from 1968 and starring charleton heston is a far far cry from the quality and plot of the original br br certainly special effects have improved since 1968 but writing has not the characters were boring and the dialog was awful i sat through the entire film with a friend who thankfully only rented it and completely understood why before christmas all of the planet of the apes toys at target were in the clearance bin br br my advice to tim burton don't put this on your resume br br my advice to everyone else watch the original 1968 planet of the apes movie
