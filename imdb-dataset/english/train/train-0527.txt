<START> i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum and many of the reviews i think tony scott made a good movie here yes it is highly stylized flashy and over the top but it is very entertaining i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me br br this movie may not be for anyone but if you like over the top dark humor cool action and dialog you should see it br br i've previously seen scott's man on fire crimson tide and enemy of the state all good movies but i like this one more it's like a roller coaster ride with great soundtrack selections visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity gory violence and have explicit dialog br br it doesn't hurt that keira is super hot and even shows nipples in this one either
<START> i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs chamberlain's mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process it's hard to remember that it isn't lindy in my opinion this performance of meryl's was better than her oscar winning turn in sophie's choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasn't recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod streep's for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominations br br definitely a top rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast
<START> 2003 was seen as the year of the matrix with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film also released was a dvd of 9 short animated films most written and made in japan and made as anime japan makes some of the best animation in the world sadly most of these shorts are disappointing the best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first matrix film br br the second renaissance is made as a historical file it tells how humans made machines in their own likeness humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts the workers of society second class citizens in the year 2090 a machine bi 66er was put of trial for murder after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him the machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world the governments of the world order to dismantle machines many machines leave human society and form their own country in the middle east o1 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations forcing them into economic crisis the human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them br br the second renaissance is a interesting watch with excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world it shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time the short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film metropolis partly the beginning with the underworld they are the themes of slavery the mistreatment of the working class and racism the short also has some religious themes and religious iconography mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own likeness seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines the machines too use religious iconography mainly forming their nation in 'cradle of human civilisation' and the machines coming to the united nations dressed as adam and eve offering an apple br br the animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like akira the set designs are great combine futuristic with historic cities e g washington d c there is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film the director mahiro maeda also directed the anime sequence in kill bill vol 1 so has good credentials to hollywood he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going br br the only real complain is a continuity error to the first matrix film because morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war but its a good watch
<START> how unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it i had never heard of this movie but there was cuba gooding jr right on the dvd cover and james woods in the background how bad can it be in a word very this movie starts o k has some twists and turns then just lays an egg the ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending how ironic a for a movie titled the end game to have such a poor one these are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry i hope cuba gooding jr and james woods don't make a habit of this
<START> all the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy o ms trogar exploding white mice the hall patrols instant classics nevermind the riff randell character br br if you don't like the ramones then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
<START> back of beyond takes place at a dive diner gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom mcgregor paul mercurio a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive we get what at first confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle afterwards he appears as a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character in the presence of the arrivals br br we know one thing is for sure and that is mcgregor's sort of spiritual sense his foresight of danger and such his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way of course tom falls for one of the thieves a young woman named charlie and suddenly it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action in fact the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant but really fails to do so even the ending of which plays out like a trite campfire tale and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws is almost just as ridiculous br br it may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing but are in the mood at least for something a little different than the usual
<START> an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger a sloth and a mammoth who saved a baby who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero cheesy effects and acting the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is lets start with the kid who plays brian what a geek i couldn't believe the mullet then there was the talking to himself i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent but still of course they had to have him skinny dipping too not something i wanted to see but jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself and better i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet finally i do not think the writer had ever read the book seeing as nothing was the same i think the book was great but this movie stunk like a smelly goat
<START> how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously i didn't want to smear my thought process of him so i resisted and resisted until finally i grabbed it up with a 'what the hell ' attitude and how surprised was i i just wish i had purchased it earlier having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife who thus meets an intriguing woman charming her in such a profound and interesting dare i say bookish way throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for br br the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin seeing his someone special bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life you just really begin to feel for him br br then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper that is the turning point in marie's estimation of dan the look she gives him when he repeats her comment about not liking ruthie sheer green eyed monster triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor this sequence is one of the most well crafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to marie br br other gut wrenching scenes dan returns from the book and tackle shop confronted by his brothers begins to describe what has just occurred when dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath br br his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne his late wife brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in life br br when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent show his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song absolute gem br br the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters they all three love their father and want to see him happy will not let him deny his love for marie the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock their stronghold and tell him so much more than that with just a few words br br i could go on and on but i will leave it for now maybe return and add more comments here in the near future but i will end by saying br br if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama that never feels forced or crass that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life not just with a woman but also with his extended family then look no further br br dan in real life 9 out of 10 for such a well rendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive with fine performances by the ensemble cast i cannot wait to re watch this again
<START> yes definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyes br br but 1 when the kids high school or college are discussing horror movies in the kitchen everything shae says is almost an exact quote from scream 1996 the thing about the big breasted girls etc br br 2 was steve not a bootleg randy from scream 3 besides the fact that it took place in october what the hell did the movie have to do with samhain pretty unnecessary if you ask me i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the 80's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram br br 4 wow they made a sam raimi reference 5 why was gary and his sister in the movie they're characters had nothing to do with anything and hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his own death 6 when gary was being killed in the bathroom at that point the deaths became simply troma licious how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door 7 gary's sister commented on haggis thats primarily a scottish dish not irish br br 8 so the lesson is if you are like shae and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film you'll be the one to live 9 the mutants were pretty cool but they looked like walking dishes of chili con carne br br 10 when they brought in gary's sister did they forget that steve had been strapped there and wonder where he went 11 was there not more than one killer shae beat that one but never encountered any more of them br br 12 what was with the flashbacks to those other people half of them shae didn't know if they were dead or alive so what was with that 13 why didn't they kill gary and his sister before 14 why did no one ever call the police and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods why did they never organize some kind of raid 15 as far as i know they were not zombies or vampires so how could she turn into one at the end i'm with everyone else on the giant huh at the end br br way better than death tunnel but still quite sloppy i still don't understand why they even placed it in ireland considering samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot
<START> a beautiful postcard of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch
<START> my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation of which jirÃ­ trnka was a pioneer his ruka is one of the finest most technically impressive animated movies i've ever seen br br a potter wakes up and waters his plant then he goes about making a pot but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself he casts the hand out but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he's forced to sculpt a stone hand he sets about it fainting from exhaustion but eventually completes the task br br in a marvellous sequence of metacinema the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings which keep him in thrall and he escapes back home he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head br br this movie doesn't hide the fact it's pure animation unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic why the hand for instance is clearly someone's hand in a glove everything else is clay strings are visible and are part of the narrative making it a precursor of the movie strings the atmosphere is eerie that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined br br the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity it's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right
<START> this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects it is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted that's not to say we're out of the woods yet but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics 1984 2001 a space odyssey compare its space station with our international space station and isaac asimov's i robot positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's
<START> this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radio's baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 7 1 2 decades later it's being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts br br as for the stooges this is a film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you'll see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn't act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano br br this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton's career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat br br in this film the stooges they didn't yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly br br overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role you'd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title it's a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it's quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film you'll see that i mean
<START> sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil' kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are fine br br now don't go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and when's the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i don't remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corral br br i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil' kim in that action
<START> flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made br br this flick exposes all the clichÃ©s and then some excruciatingly bad downs syndrome actors terribly heavy self important dialog scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat jarring editing pointless plot points all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych drivel br br it achieves exactly what it was designed to a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust funders to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years after what is it received its cannes award presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof in part of his own films he supposedly blew up at the info to this day he refuses to discuss the incident br br anyway see it and laugh this will be a classic of humor for many years to come
<START> before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much br br but this isn't half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isn't scary apart from jon's character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire drug addict woman the female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like that br br the story is basically the same as before vampire wants berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master the original vampire as in the first film you really don't care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy temple br br so there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally
<START> i have read the short story by norman maclean and the movie did justice to norman maclean's writing my husband tends to reread it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind we have videos of many of redford Âs movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around we never get tired of redford's perception of norman maclean writings and the beauty of montana the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr maclean's father according to a river runs through it methodists are baptists who can read a line which by the way is not in the short story but i think that is a funny line my husband and i are well read baptists br br i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow i disagree as one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three four rhythm of the metronome the photography is outstanding the acting is great i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer then as adult paul played by brad pitt se7ven is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it the same applies to neal burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say grace and they all leave but the oatmeal stayed on the plate that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors that is funny the sunburn the drive back home where jessie burns emily lloyd decides to go via the train line beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with him br br redford himself does a superb job as a narrator i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford barefoot in the park the nominated director producer actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece the river to me means that line that separates life from death memories and realities redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it
<START> i am a big fan of arnold vosloo finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happy br br unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos br br i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired br br i love arnold vosloo and he made the film viewable otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy film br br i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad there are some glitches in the film continuity but they are overlookable considering the low caliber of the film br br all in all i enjoyed the film because arnold vosloo was in it br br jackie
<START> did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years later br br see it if you haven't again if you have see her live while you can
