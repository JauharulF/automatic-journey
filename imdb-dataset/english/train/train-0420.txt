<START> first of all the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes aren't there enough brown eyed actors out there jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves he was a full blooded jew second of all what is it with old english language movies that are supposed to take place in non english speaking countries and everybody has english accents another example is david lean's dr zhivago aren't there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent the movie often is not true to the scriptures and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus's claim to be the messiah in the bible when jesus is baptized by john a voice comes from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased matthew 3 17 mark 1 11 luke 3 22 in the movie john the baptist says this the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy as well for example in the bible the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god luke 1 26 38 but in the movie we do not see or hear any angel mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam and when mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her she doesn't hear or see anyone either also in the movie when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem he says you shall not see me here again not until you learn to cry 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord' for i and my father are one and the same the correct line matthew 23 39 and luke 13 35 is you will not see me again until you say 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord ' period jesus never claimed to be god the movie cuts out a lot of important parts the sermon on the mount is very expurgated but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn't even in the bible a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john it seems like the screenwriter instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind and between the scenes the movie has one gem though during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son at matthew the tax collector's house i had tears streaming down my face it is the best movie i've seen about jesus's ministry but that isn't saying much because the others are just terrible jesus christ superstar is my favourite movie about jesus's last days the passion of the christ is way too graphic though i like how jesus of nazareth instead of just ending with jesus's death continues on and shows his resurrection
<START> i've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001 i hoped to see an entertaining movie but let me tell you princess blade is nothing compared to azumi the princess is not very talkative as you may have noticed she reminded me of jean claude van damme who only stared to make his point then beat the crap out of the opponents during the entire movie i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust i waited in vain crappy movie crappy dialog don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds it's so bad that in the end i was wondering how i managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour approximately i give a 4 10
<START> another made for tv piece of junk this is an insult of a war movie i use the word movie in it's loosest possible form i thought telly savalas's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video that's shown on tarrant on tv on a semi regular basis but then i'd forgot he was involved in this i'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me br br i like the bit laughs sarcastically in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties but it's blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties also the steam train the commando's are training on shows the jz jugoslavia zeleznice or yugoslav state railways logo's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly even though the makers have tried to black them out why not just film in the uk if that's where most of the film is set br br cheap rubbish and a waste of celluloid
<START> this movie was like a bad indie with a list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980's i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater scene's held off of the dock the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day
<START> well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared quite rare the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way message for ladies there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs you will understand when you see it br br all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares
<START> the basic premise of miami golem most definitely deserves a spot in the top say fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down i know top 50 doesn't sound too impressive but i've seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots i was prepared from something convoluted because the film was directed and co written by alberto de martino who was one of italy's most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters like most italian directors did around that time but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex confusing and overwhelming not all of de martino's films are worthwhile but some of them are extremely underrated like a special magnum for tony saitta holocaust 2000 and formula for a murder the concept of miami golem contains elements from numerous great sci fi and adventure flicks like alien starman close encounters of the third kind et Â but i wouldn't exactly call it a rip off the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to harold faltermeyer's axel f from beverly hills cop the rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy sci fi action horror and superhero movie gimmicks it certainly doesn't always make sense most of the time it doesn't actually but miami golem is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finish br br the plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but i'll try anyway sceptical journalist craig milford is reporting the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial dna inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it the dna cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size if this isn't problematic enough already the rich mr anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination with the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise craig milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus okay i know all this sounds grotesque and silly but i assure that miami golem is in fact a light headed and easy digestible flick the first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing because alberto de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings there are subliminal ghostly appearances supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of atlantis this is all misleading padding material however and as soon as the set up is more or less clear miami golem turns into an ordinary early 80's popcorn action movie with bloody massacres flamboyant chase sequences in the florida everglades explosions gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetus monsters in jars br br now i really don't want to raise the impression that miami golem is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema make no mistake this is a pretty bad movie the events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you don't succeed in that well than this is just a non stop spitfire of negative aspects the acting performances are painfully awful particularly b movie veteran john ireland as the archetypal james bond villainous character doesn't seem the least interested in the script you can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck laura trotter is probably the least sexy female lust object ever and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie what an embarrassment this must be for mrs trotter still her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this as she's quite hot from the neck down and finally there's the unforgettable scene where david warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol i don't think even john rambo can do this while he's a beefcake vietnam veteran and warbeck's character is a simple tv reporter
<START> this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship as a man married for 26 years i empathize with patrick warburton's character he loves his wife but he assumes she knows that i also enjoy his monotone delivery never gets too excited or too low a nice ensemble of characters this will be a nice addition to the monday night line up br br i don't know how david spade will be in his role he is best enjoyed in small doses he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women br br i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops
<START> i don't know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting it's just that it's so bland so predictable in a word mediocre
<START> generally i don't like films directed by sydney pollack the firm being somewhat of an exception and i've never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received br br although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense br br the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway i'd much rather watch any of hitchcock's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more
<START> this has an interesting albeit somewhat fanciful sci fi plot but it's wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects rae dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent
<START> as it was already put the best version ever of homer's epic entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and untouched the clothing is linen wool and fur the settings stony and bare everything is somewhat rugged and primitive a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies and it makes it all the more authentic although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been like br br the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself ulysses doesn't appear until the first hour the start being centered on his son looking after him then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts the terrifying cyclop the magic world of circe the underworld the sirens etc he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelope br br as a story the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life the cast is brilliant and international here irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards also playing nausicaa is barbara bach as barbara gregorini later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing athena is michele breton who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jagger br br as it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an innovation for its time as the first big european co production for tv italy france germany and yugoslavia i have seen this mini series in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again as it was never shown on french tv later on br br i recently found a copy on dvd all in wonderful color through internet it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles although french and german versions existed back then i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and it's quite a shame if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it ever br br there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic sword and sandal like the 10 commandments but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer's story and atmosphere
<START> i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j fox 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and 100 bills 2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time i'd be fired on the spot the organization to which i belong les clefs d'or has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously 3 similarly untrue was the concept at the end of the movie of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization br br this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary in short it does a disservice to our organization i welcome any comments
<START> i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didn't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a non entity she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter and if you can't spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one you'll start to fear for the president's safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown up versions of the kinds from 90210 no matter what your feelings about w let's hope this art does not imitate life
<START> i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the 27 of 2005 for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan doyle and i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned you may ask yourself was a c doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question however he was the creator of the famous holmes but how much of it was a sort of semi biography not the less i strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see even if you aren't interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books look a it enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it
<START> ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect well unfortunately convention city is lost so well just have to watch tarzan and his mate to find out for 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh just look at jane's nude swim while tarzan is often thought of as b adventure films made for young boys and no one else this picture proves that the series was originally very adult over seventy years later it is still as sexy as it was when it came out br br in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature it is a superb and exciting adventure story i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s but there are few from the genre i'd call great films tarzan and his mate is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today also the animals are all too cool espescially the apes throwing boulders the acting won't win any major awards soon but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture the film is once again stolen by cheetah the smartest monkey in the jungle one of the most entertaining examples of pre code hollywood out there
<START> this is the best movie i ve ever seen thomas beckett richard miller two mankinds who want to survive in the jungle of violence and madnes one shot one killed you must kill if you getting doubt about something you must survive br br p p i appologise of my bad worst english
<START> wow praise imdb and google for i have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now slaughter high man hells yeah br br i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary and actors and yadda yadda yadda 'cause you all know what's up that's why you're here anyway what i will do however is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d movie slasher joint br br in 1987 when i was around the age of 7 my father used to rent all these horror movies would he care that his kids were watching them with him no so at that young age i saw slaughter high what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time i haven't seen it since but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie for example the post sex scene why is there a metal bed in a school gets electrocuted or the guy being drowned in a cess pool come on my personal favorite though the exploding stomach from the tainted beer amazing how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it then his stomach explodes what and that great line let's take my car it always starts classic crap all the way br br i mean i look back now almost 20 years later and laugh at it but when i was 7 i was scared sh tless that jester hat or was it a mask that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f ck out br br all in all yes a crappy movie but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr
<START> russell hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945 he only directed 2 and black gold was one the other was also from 1936 frankie darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid he was obviously quite popular on the quickie circuit he made so many films in this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon br br j c anderson berton churchill is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment a geologist henry comes on the scene and helps fishtail's dad he also convinces fishtail to go to school regularly henry has his eye on cynthia the pretty teacher this was gloria shea's last film she had begun her career as olive shea in glorifying the american girl 1929 fishtail's dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and henry is determined to bring anderson and his cronies to justice when henry is kidnapped anderson tries to persuade fishtail to sell his oil lease it all ends well with oil being struck and fishtail going to military school br br it is okay for a rainy day
<START> warning this review contains minor spoilers br br well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors 4 the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the graboids br br due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago's character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and or watch however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute br br on the plus side when the graboids dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets br br i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the script br br i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with tremors what luck i thought pay for 4 get 1 for free well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4 the legend begins even exists br br tremors 4 the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10
<START> but thomas ian griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made 5 years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow plummer's character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i'd have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don't show any
