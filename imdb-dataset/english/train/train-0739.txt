<START> now for all of the cinematographical buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see but if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had you'd understand my p o v br br granted the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably scares viewers into thinking about what may be i'm a christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions it's not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god but rather a means to get your attention br br as a christian i know i'll not be left behind and thanks to movies like this i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer this is a movie you shouldn't not only see but feel with your heart and soul

<START> this is easily the most disappointing least gratifying movie of the entire so called blacksploitation genre which by the way are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home rather than being exploitation or demeaning these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era well not bucktown br br in this story duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses duke resists and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police unfortunately he does so by calling in a posse of his friends these people are vaguely explained as some former black militants who have worked with duke on jobs in the past and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it ignorance is not a justification for murder and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family cuss them out give them a jujitsu ass kickin' and set their 'fro on fire that has art and a reason for existing and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back of course in this bizarre tale she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people indeed her advice to duke is run man they gonna kill you br br following the sickening and gratuitous violence we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor as opposed to say calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors to quote the mayor they are ten times worse than what we had before now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt protection racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets unfortunately duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police duke is a pig br br finally when everyone in town but duke aretha and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin' in the street our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values they don't duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice if you are interested in this genre of film by all means i highly recommend them see coffy foxy brown truck turner blacula sheba babyÂbut if in the process you should run across this dvd throw it as far away as you possibly can drop it like it's hot it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores
<START> i can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984 it's got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it in fact it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action cop film as i can think of br br i'm glad i only saw this on mst3k with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female lead's resemblance to elaine from seinfeld none of them are spongeworthy and riff non stop on baker's weight this movie probably isn't worse than mitchell but baker's reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i wouldn't have to read that
<START> i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film's page because some of it was slightly misinformative br br originally i posted quotes from the original poster but i wasn't sure if it was proper given that this is the comments index and not a message board though we used to use 'em that way back before imdb added the film message boards so i will edit this to make it unnecessary br br well first of all you may not be aware of this but gene kelly first became famous for playing pal joey on broadway in the original production when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin panorama film he wanted kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of for me and my gal alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of pal joey this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction br br you complain that kelly's pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point but you miss the fact that kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the story characters the pictures are so bad the audience knows that kelly isn't ready for an exhibition even he knows it though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her but it's important that the audience not be sitting there saying but he's a great artist if he only had the chance you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies br br then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story he refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows he's not really ready for the exhibition his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as joey's enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serves the same function in the plot remember it's essential in pal joey the play that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn't deserve it same with the art show if kelly's paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point br br then you complain that caron and kelly have no chemistry i guess it's in the eye of the beholder i agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion br br when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you haven't dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism it's about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships if you didn't' see that it's not the movie's fault it's certainly not a load of crap
<START> anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise fields at 45 still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children i'm biased i'm in love with her br br the cast of soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection kevin kline is flawless as are robert downey jr an ingÃ©nue elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher in one of her early roles carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious br br this movie should have won oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out
<START> well i had to be generous and give this a 2 this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that lady's shirt where her breasts are i found that mildly amusing other than that this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend funny if you're willing to throw mystery science theatre comments at it with someone but it ain't no better than a 2 and a 2 pretty much sucks
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen if you know the real world and the people from those shows this movie will be top notch if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show
<START> mccabe and mrs miller takes place in the turn of the century pacific northwest into a soggy muddy mining camp john mccabe a hirsute warren beatty comes barging full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon whorehouse for the town replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history he also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha male credentials amongst the locals and thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour br br it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs miller julie christie shows up on a startling contraption that's half railroad car half automobile where did altman find that thing mrs miller immediately takes on mccabe as a business partner with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering noting that mccabe doesn't know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts it's not clear what mccabe's function will be br br the plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer mccabe to buy him out for five grand mccabe tells them to buzz off he's holding out for fifteen thousand the company finds negotiation distasteful so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill mccabe though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as mccabe's function in the whorehouse partnership excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward money offered by the local marshal would be pretty tempting br br mccabe and mrs miller purportedly classic seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is the movie tells a pretty good story the main characters have the potential to be interesting there are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14 year old stone cold killer but it's really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing once again this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness according to the trivia sheet here on imdb the movie's editor griped to altman that the sound was muddy altman disagreed and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release altman blamed the editor nice along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look only robert altman can hire a world class dp like vilmos zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have got to be kidding me the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum the exterior photography is even worse it's as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees during the climactic stretch when beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow fall that reminds one of a rankin bass christmas special br br look i can't watch a movie under these conditions get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes when you remove all that annoying altman esque overlapping dialog and when you wipe the lenses with some windex or something 3 stars out of 10
<START> this would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham this guy is an awful actor be it comedy drama tear jerkers etc he stinks it seemed like at some point priyadarshan realized this too and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo scenes a bit funny br br he's the only noticeable drawback there are a couple more annoying tid bits of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise best comedy to come along in bollywood since hungama imo like hungama it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course akshay kumar this is probably his best performance to date he better be a shoe in for best comedian at every award function ak's always been good at comedy but he takes it to a different level here the body language the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line it's a genius performance the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i don't think i've ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usa br br garam masala doesn't have one lead heroine it stars 3 incredibly hot beautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job pretty sure they are all making their debuts paresh rawal is solid as usual although his routine wears itself out after a while rajpal yadav is his typical annoying self sick of his over the top act in every movie rimi sen has nothing to do br br overall definitely worth a dekho i'd say it's funnier than no entry and that's saying a lot could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abraham br br 8 10
<START> shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can throw away crores on such stupidity shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to saif ali khan completely disappointed in your choice of film kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim wit anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes it was enough to pop a blood vessel don't waste any brain cells energy or your money to go see this go see rent amu with konkana sensharma instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india intelligent poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making
<START> i do not even want to call this thing a film it is a movie that should not have won any awards the acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios this is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an nri audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of trying throughout the movie br br i find it strange that so many actors conversant with the english language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera i'm sure many readers know what i am talking about all those token english phrases thrown into a movie in hindi and in regional cinema for cool points there are few indian movies in which the english seems completely genuine being cyrus was a recent one although not a great film it was a good film and the language did not seem put on br br i feel ashamed that p3 was awarded the nfa in 2005 the only semi enjoyable parts of this rubbish were konkana and a somewhat catchy background score other than that do not even waste your time with this film
<START> i like the movie twisted desire had jeremy jordan one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever melissa joan hart is a good actress i've seen most of her movies but all of jeremy jordan's the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets arrested and jennifer rats him out twisted desire is my second favorite movie my first is the goonies but i still love jeremy jordan
<START> before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation richard linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all it's glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance' which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna br br before sunrise works principally for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they're the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on it's own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although i'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters br br in a film like this it is the writing that's the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that's the case with the musings in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location br br before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance
<START> this is crap utter crap i cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this full moon has a number of awful films but this has got to be the worst first off the plot doesn't exist it's odd it's like they took an idea for the story and kind of never really got around to developing it they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two heroes drove around in the desert and bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes there were two scenes in the movie when dez and dazzy are driving and when dez and bradbury are driving where it just went on and on and on it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action they just drove for about 5 minutes with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape br br next we come to the acting which is simply horrible first off the girl who plays dazzy is just a beast she is so scary looking i wanted to look away when she was on screen horrible casting then you have the guy who played dez who couldn't act if his life depended on it his crying is actually funny and his madman antics are even funnier the guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad as is the guy who plays bradbury there was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever br br the makeup effects hmmm can anyone say pathetic the effects were so fake they were laughable the crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone they cut away and when they come back the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound nice did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what i must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment nice makeup there too i think they were going for a drugged look and i think she was supposed to have a black guy but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween br br this movie is just horrible from the start the story is stupid and very very unoriginal the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old the acting is the lowest of the low and so on stay away from this movie at all costs it's only 70 minutes long in the first place and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel do not waste your time on this piece of garbage
<START> this is the first of a two part back story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man's fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics extensive religious and historical imagery subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future it isn't perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and cautionary tale br br this first part sets the scene human societies have developed advanced and capable robots mostly humanoid to serve people doing menial unskilled jobs labour construction etc and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them one robot however rebels and kills his owner stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die he is destroyed but when the robot masses' destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest with many human sympathisers alongside them br br the imagery here is exploitative recounting race riots and abuse tiananmen square the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girl's guise getting harried hammered in the head and then shot dead as it pleads 'i'm real' it lays on the ground clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out it's an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individuals br br anyway this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film i robot but it soon develops into a recognisable matrix back story as the surviving robot contingent is exiled and congregates in the middle east in the cradle of civilisation as the narrator informs us there the machines regroup and begin to produce new ai and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations we see a commercial for a car that uses the circular energy hover engines that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around zero one the name of their city their goods and trade make their economy soar affecting other economies detrimentally and human governments and authorities establish a blockade in response the machines send ambassadors in the form of adam and eve resemblances to a un congress to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the blockade but they are forcibly removed and the scene is set for war in the second part br br the animation is by studio 4Â°c who work on quite a few of the animatrix and it's evocative and visually stimulating rendering different scenes like imagery montages cctv footage and particular scenes of import distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep mentalities and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the tantalising mystery offered by the first film and morpheus' vague brief info dumps this is a nice exposition of the cataclysmic events that left the world ravaged and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition the development of ai and the importance of harmony and co operation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice themes expanded on in the movies
<START> ok here it is nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama what we do is first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent and we let him flounder around between french german american and british for over 2 hours then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly but just to make sure the viewer doesnÂ´t fall asleep we throw in details which are shockingly absurd such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22 000 feet naturally we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles so we have every character even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed off city of lhasa in 1943 speak perfect english also with dubious accents of course the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story so what we do is this we have the dalai lama befriend the now reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors radios antique cars and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west in return our hero learns from his young protegÃ© a kind of vague undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader in other words we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist sort of in his own way even though we ourselves donÂ´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go and last but not least we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans which is certainly true thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie even though it is nothing of the sort so zat ist my idea vat do you zink can ve make zis movie
<START> this movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a nonstop action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
<START> after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock there's just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that he's finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his trainee replacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don't see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as 7even well maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt
<START> sort of family parody blending an officer and a gentleman heartbreak ridge full metal jacket and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now into a rather dull movie with some bright spots the gags are always there where you would expect them and damon wayans's lines are well predictable as i said unfortunately this movie never surprises you
