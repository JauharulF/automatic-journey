<START> this movie had some great actors in it unfortunately they had forgotten how to act i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the make up artist needs to get another job the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the theaters cuba gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more
<START> this is one of my favorite films of all time al pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent too bad it didn't do to well in the 80's when it was first released because people didn't get a chance to experience this classic
<START> there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film let's just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate who are not necessarily the best actors in this film i'm not saying they're not good actors i'm saying they stunk in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye pleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters br br don't get me wrong i love the story of the real titanic but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocious there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1 2 hours with the exception of maybe a biographical movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted br br i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more relieved than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intended br br in a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over hyped chick flick
<START> leave it to braik to put on a good show finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot they are completely what started adult swim brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 it may not have been platinum but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made that is why i like it so much it is just such a classic in the adult swim history i believe this is just such a great show if you don't like it hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it
<START> the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail he's going to be out of circulation either way didn't the cia have a chance before he was arrested if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him there's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but dial manages to escape so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash the film of this type of plot connivance later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying this airport is surrounded by armed coppers yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained this includes an important supporting character called emily day why does she help dial even though he's a wanted fugitive your guess is as good as mine br br this is a fairly poor thriller and don't be taken in by the big name cast wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they'l certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume
<START> the story for hare rama hare krishna actually came to dev anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous prem pujari in calcutta he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt prem pujari's posters but the life of hippies re ignited a story in dev's mind to be made into a film br br this was dev anand's perhaps best directorial effort the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and zeenat aman as dev's sister made a tremendous impact br br this film was dev anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values br br it is about a montereal based indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister but the parents quarrel and separate leaving prashant dev with mother and jasbir zeenat with father she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see prashant again br br she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that jasbir is in kathmandu with certain hippies br br to reunite with his sister dev travels to kathmandu and meets shanti mumtaz who was to later marry him and also janice who in reality is jasbir with a new name and new identity she has forgotten her childhood and dev too br br dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in kathmandu and the people are after his life br br this was a story well directed and acted both by dev anand we see more of zeenat aman than of mumtaz but the music by rahul dev burman was well composed dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film he was very close to dev and his earlier film prem pujari though was good but had been opposed in calcutta burman da wanted dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against dev but dev continued with the film reassuring burman da and the film was indeed a success br br r d burman had asha bhosle sing the award winning dum maro dum kanchi re kanchi re was another good number br br overall it is a good film
<START> i love these actors but they were wasted in this flick br br i can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this crap br br debra winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you'll probably like this too i hated both 3 10
<START> this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad you might even say non existent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too long and it's perfect for mst3k style riffing not to mention the corpse eaters drinking game scribble on forms take a shot sign your name take a shot catch a bad foley edit take many many shots br br the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness it's only an hour long hell a movie like this should have been at least 20 30 minutes longer
<START> i'm not even sure what to say about this film it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic love br br 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger
<START> besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i don't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did
<START> this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in anamorph is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of anamorph everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter stormare as the art expert james rebhorn as the police chief paul lazar as the medical examiner and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door not recommended merk
<START> i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts it's a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining
<START> okay let's not get confused here if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic's sequel here's to hoping that's not a general rule as wes craven's own sequel to the original the hills have eyes Â released somewhere during the mid 80's Â is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made part two didn't have an actual plot and re used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well the remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing with his excellent film alexandre aja nearly single handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for also aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic high tension but who is this new director aja's the hills have eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over enthusiast target groups it's a really good film and even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of aja's smashing hit bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism i must admit this rushed sequel really isn't as awful as anticipated the screenplay is routine and clichÃ©d horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive looking freaks after the events of the first film the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests which took place there in the 50's and 60's for the horribly mutated survivors of the miner's community that stayed there during the radioactive testing the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines br br this basically is just another by the numbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill it's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3 year old son the hills have eyes ii completely lacks Â as to be expected Â originality logic and plausible situations the mutated miners aren't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they aren't organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex hungry prototype monsters since you don't care for the amateur g i joe heroes and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original most peculiarly this second film isn't nearly as violent and gory as the first sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics Â mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns Â but there sadly aren't any outrageous pick axe battles or virulent dog attacks what a shame what's the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and or gratuitous filth of the original luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and you'll have the most fun spotting all the things that don't make the slightest bit of sense for example wallets falling out of people's bloodied heads women without any muscle power cast as tough ass soldiers and Â my personal favorite Â assigning the one soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications
<START> what happened to peter bogdanovich once a brilliant director a trail blazer is now scraping the very bottom is this the same man who directed the last picture show here he takes a somewhat interesting albeit farfetched premise and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite dunst is not bad but izzard is miscast as chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their looks and not because they were right for the part too bad i'll go rent paper moon again
<START> what a horrible horrible film the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time not that i saw much i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves meryl streep was awful as usual how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have aidan quinn's talents were as so often totally wasted and who told gloria estefan she could act trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school the kids weren't even cute just written in to suit the appalling script aaargh wes craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
<START> i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm's essentials series the eye of the beholder clichÃ© was never more apropos this beholder saw little of value in this one i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy lauren bacall possessed granted ms bacall was a beautiful woman but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her in bacall's defense this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film malone's performance outshines the rest although jasper hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith generally though i would have to say that i'm just not much of a fan of melodrama the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes
<START> so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to begin br br first of all it's a remarkably un scary scary movie even by amercian standards the dialogue is clichÃ© the characters are two dimensional the writing is ho hum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting br br we meet the following stereotypes in order balding loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesn't tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesn't do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black bad ass bitch with more brawn than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoks br br oh and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people given a chance they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them booh actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a deceitful spectre who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend br br there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie but this doesn't explain a lot if you've seen the first two movies fine otherwise you don't know who these people are how they are related why they aren't in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you don't the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there aren't enough of those to keep you awake br br of potenial interest amusement are the three raider punks as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they don't get much screen time they are offed almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies only to be offed again literally within a minute br br the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no dice there not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is any br br the head baddie called the tall man doesn't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years howling booooy every five minutes isn't enough why he with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper body strength doesn't simply squash our heroes like bugs isn't explained instead he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell br br filmgoers who like masterpieces like friday 13th part xxxxviii jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls
<START> no matter how well meaning his message is this film is a terribly made trainwreck awful acting lame camera work i do not know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter he is lousy at it you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around he just soaks it up he loves being the center of attention he is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker eric schaffer some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy predictable and sappy
<START> i've seen a lot of seagal movies and while most aren't great or even good this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies br br the plot not sure really something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something who are the good guys and bad guys hard to tell most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good seagals character mashall is br br acting blows br br voice dubbing what was with the horrible voice overdubbing could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs might of at least been entertaining then br br this movie is boring and completely stupid avoid it at all costs
<START> penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france italy and switzerland meet called lampidorra it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography an american multi millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take title his nearest heir is donlan br br but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling br br enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze with a few bumps in the road schmeeze solves all the problems both financial geopolitical and romantic between donlan and bogarde br br how does schmeeze work well that's the gimmick to the whole film but here's a hint in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency br br anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had br br this film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on tcm but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia
