<START> someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout demon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghosts but it's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt it's all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has built actually rebuilt for himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self centeredness but also it is intimated because she can't get used to the place since he remodeled it living in unaccustomed solitude real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody else a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees him br br this is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn't foresee or doesn't remember the movie would turn into a cat and mouse game a hunt a battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didn't expect then he would be forced to think himself out of it and maybe at the same time out of his own self imposed isolation and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the er br br nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the house if he is the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think he's slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks he's more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesn't get a good look but figures who else could it be not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key i don't know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to starve i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place and this is it the architect are you ready moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way br br if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in the architect takes up residence with martin's wheelchair ridden wife unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesn't know he's there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat burglar entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the end including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and before the story started the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses to the final long anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then ends br br here is a story that depends on the development of two things the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is and fumbles both the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel builder and sneak tenant the story should be redone by someone some day
<START> algie the miner is one bad and unfunny silent comedy the timing of the slapstick is completely off this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not however the actual quality of the film is irrelevant this is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema the main character of algie is an effeminate guy acting much like the stereotypical pansy common in many early films the film has the homophobic attitude common of the time algie the miner is pretty awful but fascinating from a historical viewpoint 3 10
<START> i am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled ity only lasted one year i just recently started watching it and i love it its a show that could of gone as far as friends went it had the humour and was extremely enjoyable br br it is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without their parents kurt joey lawrence plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly role br br this should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic amazing show with all the best actors br br 10 10
<START> this movie is flawed on many fronts like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude br br as a native texan i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective although i prefer more historical accuracy but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john wayne's or fess parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess while being only slightly less accurate br br very disappointing avoid it
<START> admittedly i first picked up ranma 1 2 when i was around twelve i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read then i went to the comic manga section and spotted this book at my first few reads through the chapters i didn't really know what was going on but i knew that i loved it i even took it home for a few more reads over frankly i wasn't getting anywhere and then about five months i'm 16 now ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga i couldn't remember what it was called but recalled that the author was rumiko takahashi creator of inu yasha i googled it and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics but it didn't really matter in the end no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind watch again i once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day i don't know how i did it but i couldn't stop eventually after about two days i grew obsessed i even dreamt as crazy as this sounds about watching ranma never have i found a series so enjoyable so funny and so heartwarming to watch to this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading br br ranma 1 2 is about a boy named ranma saotome and his dad genma saotome intense martial artists they are so intense that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became 'cursed' the grounds were full of different pools of springs and if you land in one you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water for genma that was a panda and for ranma that was a girl it's a very crafty fun loving story on top of that genma promises his friend that ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the tendo dojo alive 'course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual obviously they start to like one another but both way to stubborn to admit it but genma has a history of doing this he promised ranma to many girls br br trust me it's worth watching it's humorous heartwarming and all around amazing
<START> i saw this jolly little film at age 10 11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs i didn't know it had been in a theater at all to rate it from a kids point of view i'd give it 4 out of 5 stars because being a young boy at the time it seemed a little girlish br br the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing br br when i re discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995 i had to revisit it i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old i don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on vhs br br it's out there might even be on dvd by now at least i hope it is i want to share it with my kids someday 10 stars on here it's still a great kids film end br br 09 08 2009 finally found a vhs copy woo hoo
<START> in brave new girl holly comes from a small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end it seems a sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite a gem in the film archives
<START> 'thunderbirds' was an immensely popular sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now with both adults and children alike as it was in its heyday so one would deduce the chance to produce a live action feature film with a million pound hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'spider man' and 'the x men' but a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section br br instead of a film focusing on the five tracey sons their father and trusty geek brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen year old alan tracey fourteen year old tin tin and ten year old brain box fermat son of brains yes brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish as one can tell from a run through of our three lead characters this 2004 remake 'thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age range as those involved in the much superior revival of 'spider man' did the plot itself was so bland with clunky awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre teens the scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'spy kids' which was at least quirky and original instead of remaking the show people know and love br br although sophia myles and ron cook were excellent as miss penelope and parker they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt bill paxton's jeff tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four tracey boys while anthony edwards and ben kingsley as brains and the hood respectively were just embarrassing the hood in particular is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy two bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce br br brady corbet who plays alan tracey may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for vanessa anne hutchinson as tin tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'girl power' ironically it is young soren fulton's fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance br br 'thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances 'thunderbirds' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop
<START> as myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled however for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of freddy vs jason this is a disgrace the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it br br the acting is awful the effects well i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck hands etc no story line weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script br br you broke my tooth from one vampire you broke my cigar was the response from the human who looked like uncle jessie from dukes crossed with santa

<START> in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs breed to be expendable warriors but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is you should have made them smart as well as fast kurt russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions and his tears after being expelled from the group or his shuddering when he is given a hug and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier
<START> this picks up about a year after the events in basic instinct catherine tramell sharon stone is now in london while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles hour don't ask she goes off the road and ends up in the thames she survives he doesn't the police hire psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow br br this movie was doomed before it even opened it took forever to get a cast and director script problems were constant and the cast was not happy morrissey complained about the movie often still it's not too bad it's a lot like the first there's a lush music score beautiful locations plenty of sex and nudity this had to be edited for an r a nicely convoluted plot and good acting but there's no impact it feels like a retread of the first people are being killed here with a choker leash i believe just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly she's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders the similarities are too apparent br br this is also very r rated there's plenty of explicit sex talk male nudity morrissey looks a lot better nude than michael douglas female nudity stone still looks great and some bloody murders the acting is good across the board stone is just fantastic here morrissey looks miserable but is ok charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in supporting roles br br so this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first still i recommend it people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to basic 14 years after it was made
<START> dear me where do i start the dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad he corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film the favoured exclamation in this film is jesus christ zombies are agile stupid and few and far between motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist people 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 mph the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days breasts appear for the sake of breasts normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity there's a dog for no reason and thin orange blood that turns the stomach the general and his catchphrase of shut the f k up is the only redeeming feature as for the rest i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves

<START> i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt the opening moments with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter diana about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art give the impression that this could be a kick ass artsy vampire flick turns out this initial impression turns out false oh troma the mark of some kind of lack of quality sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk food craft or sometimes not this is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor i e the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions are weak at best and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapel's bargain basement direction br br and it's not without him trying oh lord no he does try a lot which is a big part of the problem he and his producers had money for lights sure but the way they're used in the movie made i a former student filmmaker and aspiring director sulking in my seat if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3 point lighting set up while this along with a very lackluster sound design or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a troma release it should be something basic that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary and it isn't or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments br br it's not a good movie by any stretch and perhaps if you're a vampire die hard or just a vampire period it might have some appeal as a low rent bargain basement alternative to near dark or as a slight improvement over say 1972's blood freak you have better ways to waste your time overall
<START> i had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad but don't make this think that i didn't enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80's style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warrior's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and there's some crappy model effects those aren't supposed to be real trees are they and i still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons it's much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i don't think so rent it and you'll see yo
<START> i only saw this movie once and that was enough for me the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho sadistic violence and very little of anything else i wanted to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second night of the demons and i wanted to see her playing someone normal unfortunately the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot zoe i know where you are now hiding from this film
<START> i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts the true test is whether it is good from start to finish which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review most of us would agree even those like me who enjoy reading many blogs that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons likewise fem can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography from start to finish fem feels like a pieced together vlog heck even myspace gets some pimping if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 i don't i'd go watch it fem while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media is so personal that it is without an interesting story it's like watching the mundaneness of life which i think most would agree is very naturally boring and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it their very postmodern film about making a film cue my yawn br br ultimately i come away not caring the least bit about any of it i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review even it's not that fem is downright bad because it isn't it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe just maybe something of interest is about to happen it's rather that it's just downright mediocre i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron passionate indifference br br i hope the creators actors in the film get out of debt from their efforts they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life br br see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do otherwise pass it by and don't worry that you've missed some great undiscovered talent you really haven't
<START> welcome to oakland where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood can't stop them this low budget direct to video production seems timed to coincide with the release of land of the dead the latest installment of george a romero's famed zombie series the ghetto setting and hip hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner city gore hounds ricky carl washington works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother jermaine brandon daniels but the teenager bored by macaroni and cheese dinners in their tract house would rather spend his time hanging with street friends marco and kev apparently there is not a lot for african american high school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys including rival latino gang bangers ricky plans to sell their late parents' house and move inland to the castro valley a more middle class and presumably safer environment unfortunately before this can happen a drive by shooting leaves jermaine dead on the porch grief stricken ricky tries a last desperate ploy he tells scotty his lab assistant to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats when a double dose fails to revive jermaine there is no choice except to call 911 but a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue the boy is reanimated as a sputtering growling zombie chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat the feeding frenzy infects more victims and before the night is over the east bay is a battleground between the living and the blood spattered undead the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers from ed wood to herschel gordon lewis to charles band but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films consider val lewton's programmers cat people the leopard man isle of the dead roger corman's poe quickies romero's night of the living dead and john carpenter's halloween the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars' worth of recent high priced horrors cheapness has its charms in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones lending a bleakness as oppressive as douglas sirk's bourgeois melodramas of the '50s lines seem more improvised than scripted so what the hell are we gonna do now just keep your eyes open for any f n' thing that looks out of the ordinary ricky and scotty call their boss who calls an ex military man named romero i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast not a problem says the merc closing his phone and grabbing his guns everybody has guns and even when fighting zombies they're on their cell phones as who isn't nowadays information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement what happened we got into it with some crazy motherfockers deja f n' vu it's that park zombie again ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away saying only she's gotten out of hand unlike most zombie movies this one provides a motive for mayhem jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him who in turn continue the rumble this is urban film making that implies its own social commentary a near guerrilla production suggesting a future for low budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichÃ©s the brothers quiroz who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product considering their limited resources jose and eduardo quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know photographer rocky robinson gets the job done music by eduardo quiroz is no simpler than carpenter's haunting halloween theme and hip hop songs by the darkroom familia and others add atmosphere the result is promising if not exactly exhilarating they are learning their craft and unlike lewis and wood who never got any better their next may be one to watch
