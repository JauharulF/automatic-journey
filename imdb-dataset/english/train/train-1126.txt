<START> jim carrey is good as usual and even though there are quite a few jim carrey moments it's definitely not a jim carrey movie br br it's targeted mostly at children and i managed to enjoy it as such movie it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed br br the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids i can't say i loved this movie but then again i'm not its target audience
<START> this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni i love them both their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there the husband in his brief role is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but in his own way a loving father the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn't more renowned
<START> i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film br br not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move we just hear the thoughts of characters is only one unconventional aspect of it br br searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead the main actor was dead it was not kept in any british tv or film archives that it was never released on video or dvd that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no recordable devices for consumers br br on the second viewing recently i could see why it was unforgettable at times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a harold pinter stage play br br again if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam whiteflokati hotmail com

<START> with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine this was the horror movie that started it all john carpenter brings to life a nail biting nightmare on halloween night when laurie strode jamie lee curtis in her debut career defining role and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell br br michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier he is now back in haddonfield the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived he begins to stalk and terrorize her turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her br br beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion br br although halloween is certainly outdated it is by no means less chilling the idea alone is goose bump inducing and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today
<START> this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer the events in this movie are not even close to the truth why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce don't even waste your time watching this for free low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of which is really what this movie did if they would allow me to give a 10 to this movie i would the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s save your time and money by not watching this movie
<START> this film is a pia zadora special when viewing it i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood starlet in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for 'b' movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session well of course i do not normally do roles requiring nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film this recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying well of course i do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol this is probably grossly unfair the rather sordid tale is the fault of harold robbins book considering the nature of the story pia's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention and perhaps pia who once won an acting award in butterfly is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing but this is grossly unfair the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties the real problem with the lonely lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this br br the screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement as it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am assessing my personal opinion or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing my personal rating for it would be two out of ten but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four
<START> wow this is really not that good br br i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good it is but it is nothing special br br the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies br br
<START> i love all dogs go to heaven even though i'm a guy this and the land before time are the best animated films that don bluth has made in the movie gharlie barkin burt reynolds is helped by his friend itchy dom deluise freedom out of the pound in new orleans 1939 charlie who's in casino business wants to share equal with his partner carface vic tayback carface who is unwilling to share the equal with charlie pushes a car on a bridge onto charlie killing him charlie enters heaven and meets annabelle melba moore who shows charlie that his time is up by showing him a watch that has stopped and she explains that all dogs go to heaven because all dogs are naturally good charlie hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to earth alive with annabelle screaming you can never come back charlie reunites with itchy and they go and explore soon to find out that carface has not only attempted to murder charlie he has also kidnapped a little orphan girl named ann marie judith barsi when carface leaves charlie and itchy help ann marie escape the next day charlie itchy and ann marie go to look for money ann marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her while ann marie talks to the couple charlie sneaks up behind the man and steals his wallet charlie ann marie and itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man's money that a horse will win the race the horse they said would win winds up winning and charlie itchy and ann marie are payed 1 000 for the bet charlie promises ann marie he'll use the money to give to the poor but winds up buying a new casino and gambling and buys pizza for his friend flo loni anderson and her puppies soon ann marie has found out that charlie had stolen the wallet from the man and used his money on the horse race and everything charlie sad about this has a dream about going to hell and the devil soon charlie awakens and finds out that ann marie is gone she has left to give the wallet back to the couple who forgive her about the wallet and invite her to breakfast charlie asks ann marie to leave with him and she does pretending to be sick but are captured by mice who try to feed them to king gator but they manage to escape soon carface shows up and captures ann marie he plans to drown her but charlie comes to the rescue and calls on king gator who eats carface charlie's time is up and he must die again itchy with the help of the other dogs finds the couple who took ann marie in and get them to come with them to where ann marie is they are there in time to save ann marie but are too late to save charlie who's time has ended charlie who is awarded for his heroic effort for saving ann marie is welcomed back to heaven but before he enters he says good bye to ann marie who has been adopted by the couple and asks her to take care of itchy for him she says yes and tells charlie she loves him and good bye charlie enters heaven again as it's said all dogs go to heaven filled with wonderful animation characters and story don bluth has proved to us again that he is a good animator it's too bad this movie was release the same year little mermaid which is my favorite disney movie they both came out in 1989 which was the year before i was born i guess i'll have to call them both the best animated features of 1989 10 out of 10
<START> this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance br br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
<START> just a regular jason lee movie there were some parts of the movie that were funny the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess these are the types of movies that i think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties it was an all right movie it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot its just kind of a boy meets girl movie this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central i am glad that i didn't see this movie in the theater i would have been angry but i guess that's why i didn't see it in the theater
<START> ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many '50s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there's a twist at the end br br there's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies but it's nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn't talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird the movie's pure hokum but harmless
<START> i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with strips of black leather on it it was marion's clothes or lack of them that really got me do the 'fans' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face an old trick the hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows as if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over' raw bin hood and liddle john' the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
<START> this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex slaves he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929 providing the family with food whenever she could of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex communication my daughter was fascinated by the movie we have made it a part of our library
<START> warning contains spoilers br br first of all i would like to say that i really liked this game i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents i am glad that i did that br br first off i would like to say that the single player was very good the first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in london and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter of course you have to rescue her and it is quite a big level but should probably take you at least five minutes the best part and i think also the funniest part is when you are in the jet pack and people are rappelling down big ben just equip the jet pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down pure fun br br the rest of the levels are very good but pretty short there are four mini levels you can unlock and that is one of the let downs because only the first two of them are actually fun and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives i mean c'mon we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad br br the multi player me and some of my friends agree is very good and challenging even if there are no bots halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games you can be a load of bad guys and you go against each other and you can also set traps which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character br br gameplay 8 5 10 levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved graphics 9 10 there is the odd bad graphic but that isn't extremely often multiplayer 10 10 needs no comment just great you get to drive in jet packs and vehicles sound 8 10 replay value 7 10 the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1 br br i give this game 8 5 10 br br could have a bit of improvement but it's still good
<START> i've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told i'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film there are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense i urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention the story made perfect sense to me and as i said was very well told every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film br br all the actors did a fantastic job sean connery was very good in his role as always laurence fishburne was superb as tanny brown playing a very interesting character kate capshaw was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic blair underwood was a pleasant surprise i didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance ed harris was the real gem in the film he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is watch his eyes in his scenes just superb also there is a very young scarlett johansson as kate in one of her first roles not a bad place to start excellent cast in this film br br i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers this is a great film and should be seen don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own conclusions i hope that you will see the film and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do thanks for reading br br chris
<START> i'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war this ain't it and for that matter neither was the emmerich devlin gibson the patriot but i digress br br i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios now sony just before it came out the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran robert dillon directed by the esteemed hugh hudson of chariots of fire fame and starring al pacino br br but it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about pacino's horribly misconceived accent he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry and that of nastassja kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england then the story started and it all went downhill fast br br motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer pederast his accent was all over the map too i guess there weren't any english actors available br br lots of people left those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed i stuck it out i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good i was wrong inexplicably hudson chose to film them with hand held cameras not even steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale br br there was a semi famous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me the late gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us and sure enough on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'franklin scale of 1 to 10' while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didn't know art when they saw it what a buffoon br br after this disaster pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years hugh hudson's career never recovered you can't say i didn't warn you
<START> the story of peace loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land water law and order and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier shane and probably later films as well there's some good action scenes and the general layout of the story excluding a disappointing ending is well executed law and order and religion have established roots in the town but the old order of cattle drives cowboys and gunslingers is still around as well the clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap granger an ex gunfighter plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun
<START> i saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a saturday evening it really is the perfect time for this one i have never ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes if you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through however if you want a good laugh please watch it i even bought the chuck norris 3dvd collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night what especially struck me is that Ã©very scene that would be expensive to make was copy pasted from a discovery documentary or an old tv special on the us army furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real afghanistan is as far as i can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click deke escapes from the terrorists sand castle with his jet pack and is taken away by a submarine probably discovery later on in the movie deke throws an islam terrorist against the wall in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall gotta love it i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why i've been mad enough to spend 6 99 euro's on the box
<START> in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure bill and ted are under threat from the future as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted in order to change the future br br in a great comedy pairing winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel though lacking the sharpness of the first bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth the grim reaper watch for the games sequences the best moment in the entire film but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre br br though still packed with humour this film has a more dramatic film towards it with stakes being more serious and situations more risky br br this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present as is evident in the final couple of scenes br br the first watch i hated this sequel but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor bogus journey has enough feel good motives jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film
