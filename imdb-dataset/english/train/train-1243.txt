<START> i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the angels' and is great throughout the film also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon levitt and milton davis jr christopher lloyd is good as al 'the angel' and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie a touching and heart warming movie which everyone should enjoy
<START> wow this was another good spin off of the original american pie not as good as band camp but definitely a lot better the naked mile dwight and erik stifler lead the comedy in this one but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile the script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly however most of the comedy came from sex but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right br br the midget rock also had a really good cameo considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it br br the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile if you liked any previous american pie films you should like beta house unless you view all of the american pie spin offs a waste of money
<START> sure he became rapidly uneven after this film but from knife in the water up till the tenant roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique despite many running themes alienation paranoia no two of his films are really alike the story of this is somewhat similar to his own repulsion from ten years earlier but the tone is completely different the tenant manages to balance darker than dark absurdity i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny with some truly suspenseful paranoia polanski was always a master at building unease and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus br br in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange the rest of the cast offers strong performances also especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones the tenant is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both repulsion and rosemary's baby but its just as brilliant as either of those classics 9 10
<START> actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chases crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed br br the interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab and the pancake make up on the corpses cracked me up not pancake make up in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student viewer br br ah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci fi horror flick i know of but i can't a computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen gimme a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just isn't realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it br br one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construed however
<START> we should all congratulate uwe boll he's done the unthinkable he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb he's like some kind of cinematic cockroach no matter how little talent he has and no matter how bad these movies are he manages to keep making them i know he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund but even so his ability to keep making movies despite absolute complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe br br it wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games even the latest one the new nightmare was good for a few hours of game play there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnby's adventures but this is not it now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter the reckoning what's next silent hill doom i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game to movie adaptations if he's not stopped someone needs to take away his line of credit or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise no one is interested in that title any more br br think about it is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore no way a new house of the dead game comes out for x box and nobody's gonna care the title is dead and all because of uwe boll so if any of you out there work for a game publisher or know a game publisher or have access to a game publisher please warn them br br this movie itself is not even worth reviewing i can't separate what i didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it literally everything about it sucks the writing the acting the music the cg effects the editing i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations i wouldn't be disappointed boy was i wrong never underestimate uwe's ability to turn out a big steaming pile of boll sh t
<START> spoilers strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film allow me to add balance by pointing out the following br br script dreadful as tom and dan are getting to know each other bantering about films the talk is clearly that of one person and i suspect it was the director who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent at one point dan asks have you heard of the hiv virus and it sounds about as natural as asking have you communicated with the nine alien races br br acting white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make speedman did well enough with what he was given i suppose but marsden was terrible unsympathetic unbelievable and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity there is an emptiness to his performances also see interstate 60 br br plot spare me the moments of half escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down they don't work man tee hee and beware the semi black and white flashbacks which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas br br most important of all most dangerous evil and offensive is the homophobia external or internal you decide in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all excuse me where was tom while they were having sex there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in general br br in sum beware
<START> the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible although the storyline wasn't so bad in fact all story lines are good and bad throughout the movie i dosed off a few times i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise but not a good actor in rush hour 2 chris tucker too wasn't good and zhang ziyi what can i say a few lines terrible acting but that's based on her script all the characters there were not that good but some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him
<START> maybe i'm really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman that's me schultz lordy lordy what i would give to see the light firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled you'll never get rich 1955 59 could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actor comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes br br such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton more the lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle croc's block br br one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie going public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart br br so as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let's consider some other points br br right here today the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 co stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbc s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a bilko re make it just didn't click br br perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked 'em but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me br br so we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what's next howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday ames and tv's 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first poodle schnitz
<START> for anyone who may not know what a one actor movie was like this is the best example this plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense it's full of cliched situations hackneyed lines melodrama comedy you name it br br but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing and this movie is by no means an exception everyone turns in a decent performance shashi kapoor waheeda rehman ranjit om prakash smita patil but it is the megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence without him this movie would have been a non starter the story is about separation mistaken identities misunderstandings love hate loyalty good vs evil everything really amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all counts in an otherwise silly film and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny
<START> beforehand notification i'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when i saw the preview for this movie i was thinking finally i have yet to see one movie about popular african influenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a black woman i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it breakin breakin 2 save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop african influenced dance and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it so i felt this movie has been a long time coming however the race does not make the film so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watch br br pros i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture i can't recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican had believable accents and weren't stereotypical with the beanies the steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didn't make the plot stereotypical i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed i loved the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main character's parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the fellas i don't see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black films br br cons i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but i question whether they've been to real step shows whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand feet beats at a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet it was awkward i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus stomp the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in stomp the yard meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the deltas let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music i know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film br br i'm not a keyshia cole fan so every time i saw her all i kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me i thought they should've used a host like free or rocsi instead deray davis was funny as usual though also i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to do br br i would've given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs
<START> gone with the wind is one of the most overrated movies in history it is a film loved by mothers grandmothers and shut ins who go to the movies once every five years as a zombie movie it blows there isn't a shambling corpse in sight and it's terribly light in the gore department zombie 3 on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood spilling therefore it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish it is however not boring rubbish after a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground the terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh eating zombie one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady once she's bitten lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature it is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest or don't like gone with the wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
<START> as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence fishburn is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner
<START> i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young around 15 it was on star movies one afternoon the movie started a bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really caught pace after the first half hour br br all the actors are great especially blades and lou diamond i guess it's the ensemble they just play so well together i can watch this film anytime i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious br br a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
<START> i remember watching this film back in 86' when it first came out what an awful film the acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind i think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion i was not tired that i remember please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining it's just a pity i couldn't give it a zero or a negative score i wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor if i remember right i sat watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was
<START> spoiler alert br br i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but it's convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away rene z tries hard with an underwritten part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i can't remember the one that's not chris penn is a big sweaty over actor see it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it and so confusing you can't understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects
<START> this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and a light eccentric character study as well br br the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of it is really rolling on the floor type funny except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments but it does have its amusing moments and it is very deft in its execution the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element br br the union procedures are quite droll very reminiscent of i'm all right jack especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character the political machinations actually carry the story ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy br br i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers or kind hearts and coronets but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing
<START> i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr henson is just so very missed
<START> the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film br br despite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the 1970's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy br br superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10
<START> this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but Â as a retired soldier Â i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted the story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier Â and an african american at that Â to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of brashear's work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950's and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner
<START> disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in new mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons the town of weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes the henleys watch a blair witch project esquire video diary left by the town's last victim which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie although hamlin and dey's performances are much better than the supporting casts' their emotional affect seems flat to me throughout the movie br br disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction however the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable it appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes that they threw away all the elements of good story making plot development gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution outcome br br the most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we didn't deserve an explanation br br what was the significance of the indian symbols on the walls what happened to the original people of weaver what was the connection with the people at the dinner what did the sheriff know what did the missing boy discover if anything br br this was i believe a bad move since it engendered some resentment i had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things these are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand alone movie
