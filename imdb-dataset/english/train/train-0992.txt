<START> i've seen many of guy maddin's films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour de force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience br br another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works though his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake br br as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well
<START> i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1 thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1 d8 which would be illegal but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience
<START> this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episodes ever i am not a shakespear fan but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed like i said though this one is quite boring it is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help this is the one mst 3000 i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep
<START> i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of view br br krisana or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows matiss a lonely latvian archivist as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so that's the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act as a detective who investigates the incident tells him we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die br br comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his blowup will most likely abound in any review you read about krisana the influence of antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of blowup are clear and in fact writer director fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks did br br the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the college film class look and sound of the film he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film whether or not that was kelemen's intention the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money but this constraint is used to the film's advantage br br krisana succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self serious it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt if you are more concerned with plot this film and its ending may frustrate you otherwise take the time to be engaged by it it is well worth seeking out
<START> bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story i felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original english movie this movie is very indianised if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the ending but on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions tabu was good as a caring wife and mother everybody acted well
<START> the good br br effective color scheme good costumes top notch set production well detailed cgi buildings and vehicles br br the bad br br horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago flawed logic a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it no one really even questions it and there is no explanation as to why the god horus was even cast out nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jill br br the ugly br br awful script so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized the dialog was almost laughable at some points random characters and events that are not needed dull characters jill is supposed to be this mystery but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer there is nothing to her she is uninteresting and boring to watch she has no substance no texture her character has no redeeming qualities in fact there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose any goals besides the obvious one of horus any motivation they are weak and ill conceived there are no stakes the key to screen writing horus will not become immortal but big deal he is a bad guy one cannot even decipher whether horus or jill is the main character that is the problem devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character never brings one to fruition they are cardboard cut outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces first time director pacing slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring everything is flat even the action is not interesting because it is short lived and sometimes unnecessary br br overall br br not worth a watch threadbare story sub par character development corny cgi does not save the nice set production
<START> this might be unbelievable but this movie has grossed 878 138 in russia it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running well i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh movie which had almost no screening around the world that's some kind of enigma haha maybe it was based on the fact that another movie pledge this with paris hilton which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln besides both movies had a lot of promotion like there were the banners all over the city tv commercials and etc speaking about movie i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring it could be better really even if it has jessica simpson
<START> little man now on dvd is a wayans brothers flop it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home he then goes through all sorts of home alone or child's play like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film the jokes have been done in other places so many times that they aren't cute or funny i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over in watching the deleted scenes minus cgi this actor was funny in a mini me like way but they chose a different route a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes spend your rental fee on borat if you want some real laughs these days br br http mcmusicnotes blogspot com
<START> the trick to creating a good solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances colorful characters or surprising twists anyone who has ever labored in frustration with an un finishable sunday new york times crossword knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve ceases to be any fun the best murder mysteries be they on film or in print are slight affairs that get to the point spell out their clues line up their suspects and hopefully zap us with a few surprises being complicated without being unduly confusing and they play fair on second third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place indeed good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we anticipate the double and triple crosses br br sidney lumet's comedy thriller deathtrap as derived from ira levin's hit broadway play is a great example it moves along at a tidy clip skillfully juggling its clues being almost totally honest with us even when it is lying to us and yet never revealing where it is going even when it is telling us where it might go it is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries derived from a play about playwriting rather than going backward a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened deathtrap leads us through the crime s step by step leaving ample room for the unexpected as the ads advise it is less a whodunit than a who'lldoit br br deathtrap is often compared unfavorably oddly enough to the play and movie versions of sleuth though in reality it has much more in common with scream the self mocking essay on teeny bopper horror flicks like that clever film deathtrap labels itself a thriller about thrillers sets it parameters a one set five character moneymaker and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief br br deathtrap bravely gives us a mystery with only five major characters two of which are of minimum importance henry jones as a cagey lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition and to supply us with his penchant for folksy charm and irene worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychic cum sleuth who acts as the nominal detective that leaves three main characters to be the killer s and or the victim s it is a testament to michael caine's abilities that as sidney bruhl a down on his luck author of mystery plays he creates a character who we intrinsically like and trust even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie as his adoring if somewhat ditzy wife myra dyan canon flirts with being over the top by giving a roller coaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be frail or overbearing crafty or hysterical timid or bold and uncompromisingly in love with a less than reciprocating sidney the third angle of this unexpected triangle is a fledgling playwright named clifford anderson played by christopher reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is enthusiastic preppie wannabe writer semi innocent victim or cunningly charming sociopath as the various character dance around each other the cleverly dour script adapted by ace scribe jay presson allen manages to be consistently amusing even as it builds suspense and even after the final twist an improvement over the play's finale it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what br br lumet is by no means a master of comedy so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp theatrical yet subtle work with reeve being particularly noteworthy but what lumet does so well is to work skillfully in tight quarters as he did brilliantly in 12 angry men he takes a one set play and with a minimum of opening up manages to make what could have been cramped stagy and stagnant seem endlessly photogenic and spacious the setting a country home converted from an old windmill is relatively small but as designed by tony walton it manages to be both cozy and charming as well as spooky and treacherous it is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character and as the scene of the crime it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed
<START> paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a dirty old man type of way hollow man the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it's mind blowing special effects perhaps the best so far around and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provoking and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven br br two major flaws josh brolin aka walking ape man and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder why were they trapped down in the lab br br a fun horror film for a saturday night
<START> i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors iÂ´ve seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh Â´till my stomach hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobodyÂ´s waiting for so if youÂ´re tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window
<START> a propaganda film for the palestinian cause if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli palestinian conflict you will need to look elsewhere if you are an anti semite or merely an anti zionist nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country right or uncritically in support of palestinian goals e g mass murder the destruction of israel this is the documentary for you should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us however any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti semitic filth
<START> two days after seeing this thing i'm still in agony over having seen it it's so bad you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe much less allow it to be loose on the general public stilted acting a leading man who looks like he's sleepwalking and alison eastwood embarrassing herself the action is indicative of low budget movie making which means it is painfully bad the plot well if you were 6 years old then you could have written this movie simplistic idealistic and just plain lame
<START> myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better series the whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it no doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watching excellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the casting first rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material so grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video
<START> for a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull br br nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don't generate any real excitement or interest br br the acting is good from the two leads cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to br br the problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn't interesting succo is not a unique character he isn't interesting or exciting br br films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it
<START> the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music hall stage appropriately enough for a production that's more lionel 'oliver' blair than brecht the acting talent is shamefully misused migenes and walters are good but don't have to try very hard migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material julia looks perfect as mack but struggles with the character straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent harris's peachum is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious the adaptations of lyrics script and music are often awkward it was a bad move to base the film on marc blitzstein's bowdlerised broadway version but at least his words were singable unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness and the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain basement vittorio storaro fails utterly the film just looks cheap shoddy and thoughtlessly made disgraceful
<START> this film is a pure failure i am a steve martin fan but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script think police academy 7 and apply it to a military parody yuck br br i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received and rightfully deserved it is extremely misleading i have often seen this film marked down to 3 00 in the grocery store and now i certainly know why br br if only i could get my 90 minutes back
<START> daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor he is brilliant as christy brown a man who has cerebral palsy who then learned to write and paint with his left foot a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father worth watching for the outstanding performances
<START> there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this film the original said it all and still holds up either read the book or do some research about the story and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous eric roberts as perry smith his sister could have done a better job having been to holcomb edgerton ks where the story takes place the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas the original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims belongings unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall the original is available on dvd in widescreen now let this turkey die a quick death
<START> i'm afraid that i didn't like this movie very much apart from a few saving graces it's nothing to write home about br br j horror has boomed for the last five six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success this is one of them br br basically this is a supernatural slasher movie the beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together but soon after opens them however after that it's quickly downhill for this flick br br to be kind i will start with the things i like about gawi on the plus side the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type for those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed no pun intended murder scenes we also get a few good suspense sequences set pieces br br however there are quite a few drawbacks also br br first of all and my major complaint about this movie is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity usually that's not a problem for me but here where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are i was confused on more than one occasion br br the performances are okay i guess a little hard to tell when you don't know the language but seem a little stiff and for a horror movie i don't think it was scary enough for a while i was quite bored actually br br being a fan of giallo movies i was expecting quite a lot from nightmare but unfortunately i was quite disappointed
