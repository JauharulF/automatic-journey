<START> in the future of 1985 a governmental committee headed by howard hesseman is holding hearings on tv's first uncensored network they sample it's programming that play as a series of skits i can name the good 'skit' movies on one hand not using my thumb amazon women on the moon kentucky fried movie the meaning of life and mr mike's mondo video notice how i didn't mention tunnel vision the reason for that is that this 'movie' is death in cinematic form none of the skits are even remotely funny or even the least bit clever it takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers' part to not even get one laugh out of me br br my grade f br br eye candy dody dorn goes full frontal
<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen there were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep ok it was a late night show this is a no sense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again i would love to watch the making off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting i wonder the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album even if you're a fan of bjork's music stay home it's the best thing to do the little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture god
<START> if asked how i would define the word shallow i would reply watch a jerry bruckheimer production if asked how i would define the phrase wasted potential i would reply watch a jerry bruckheimer production bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics off the top of my head i can only think of an officer and a gentleman and black hawk down getting a lot of critical acclaim br br crimson tide too received some begrudging acclaim from critics it s certainly one of bruckheimer s better films which alas isn t saying much the problem i had is the scenario that sets up the story the russians are fighting the chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of russia leading to an ultra nationalist russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the west if they interfere maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but i found this set up very unconvincing it s not helped by some errors in geography like the french carrier foch being in the med wouldn t the foch be better positioned in the black sea or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the balkans the first gulf war and even vietnam once again the adjective very unconvincing crept into my mind the story does improve somewhat when the story proper a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two gets underway director tony scott does his best as do the cast but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario the worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when ww3 was a real possibility nay probability this film would have terrified me but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means crimson tide has little impact
<START> having developed a critical eye for film and a love for good cinema i went to see antwone fisher with my breath symbolically held while i am an unabashed fan of denzel washington both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona i am an honest enough fan to admit the very few times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two and i could be wrong about those after all i am not an actor but this was different denzel would pour his career's experience into and guide a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man the abuse of a child as his directorial debut no less and develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man i didn't want to be disappointed br br and i wasn't br br what i did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell but who triumphed despite it all this film did it and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it it takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented it takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it and if he can further draw an audience in and cause an audience to emotionally respond without pity the filmmaker has done his job in any film black white purple or polka dotted that is what makes good cinema bravo denzel washington derek luke joy bryant and most of all antwone fisher you have indeed won
<START> another wonderful patterson book made into an incredibly awful movie if the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t v movie that's 10 times worse i am desperate for a good movie that will do one of his books justice
<START> ok there are people who should not see this movie br br 1 don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour 2 don't like it if you got offended by the watchmen 3 don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie br br the rest of you run don't walk to see mystery men it's funny it's quirky it's a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man occasional forays into junior high humour don't ruin the tongue in cheek low key fun of jeanane garafalo ben stiller and hank azaria as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear good to see louise lasser getting work too i laughed all the way through utterly unserious somewhat weird but good
<START> this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get terrorized by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they're stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it
<START> the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention br br the video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film yeah sure it's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile 1 10
<START> this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to boggy creek as if it's a sequel this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid yes it's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8 12 y o group which it targeted it's harmless g rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it strictly for the 8 12 y o set older kids will get bored and think it lame
<START> andrewjlau i could not agree more my girlfriend is watching this at this very moment and i find this movie appalling quote from my chinese girlfriend laughing they are doing all this for a man br br i find these women have no intensity no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity and that these men are hardly worth fighting for during the dance scene where zhang zi yi wins them over the men look stupid more than admiring br br japanese people have much more intensity than chinese people and being geisha is japanese culture i am sure the chinese had something similar but the faces do not match the main br br anyway the dialogue is so unmysterious so american had a european done it with european orientals they would have done a far better job br br i have to add it seems most of the people who liked the film are american sorry to say but no wonder all spelt out for you not instinctive not passionate i think the chinese actresses are lovely but i could not say they were good actors in this film yes the cinematography is great but really i cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex deep individuals br br i'm going to japan to see the real thing i am sure that would be amazing to see
<START> i saw switching goals twice and always the same feeling you see the olsen twins make same movie they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys ok now about the movie first off all such little boys and girls don't play on such big goals 2 football does not play on time outs 3 if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime a minute or more and the finish is so foreseen i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement if it were done by european producers it would be better and also the mane actors aren't the wright choice they suffer from lack of authentic ok they played some seasons in full house but that doesn't make them big stars you have got to show your talent and that is what is missing in the olsen twins
<START> good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds lots of tough guys throughout cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type several holes appeared in the picture but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing one really dumb scene shows heston emptying 45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire a to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo b the grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip
<START> william s hart as jim treen the most eligible bachelor in canyon city is finally getting hitched to pretty blonde waitress leona hutton as molly stewart his fiancÃ©e doesn't know it but mr hart is secretly the western town's most wanted bandit however hart is planning to go straight due to his marriage plans unfortunately ms hutton discovers hart's secret stash whilst cleaning up his untidy cabin so she calls off the wedding next hutton succumbs to the charms of mining swindler frank borzage as w sloane carey br br serviceable entertainment from superstar hart he was ranked no less than 1 at the box office by quigley publications for the years 1915 and 1916 ahead of mary pickford the principles perform capably later on frank borzage was quite a director and leona hutton a suicide br br a knight of the trails 8 20 15 william s hart william s hart leona hutton frank borzage
<START> it's not really about gymnastics swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery or microbiology or a booger flicking tournament instead like every other rocky flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market it's about conquering adversity with stick to it iveness rendering all social personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome with love interest standing by of course ronald reagan top to bottom in short so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up especially the love interest brought to you by none other than mr keanu reeves warming up for ted heroine olivia d'abo's hateful alkie dad and big hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch nemeses teammates one of whom appears to be made of porcelain it's my instinct to be appalled by the comic relief black guys but on the other hand at least they're in the movie but d'abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward girl shtick and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter it's all just bodies hurtling around and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion it's all performed by an obvious double
<START> this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one br br this is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demise br br gwen verndon showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that maureen stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier br br i only hope that this film doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think br br why did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsense br br if the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well after all he had found his lady love br br this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there br br sadly with the exception of wilford brimley at this writing vernon gilford stapleton ameche tandy cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
<START> nope i am just not going to get with it here i refuse to go along with the program don't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over rated look at the reader comments and their star ratings most are 6 10 7 10 or better i think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself which is unique how many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog dvd titles i watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation expecting fireworks and instead got someone popping a gucci shopping bag it looked great but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didn't do much to save it br br the film's background story says it all director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie is informed the footage will not be appropriate sets it aside waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd original and shocking in a deliberate calculated manner goes without saying but we aren't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone we must consider the entire film and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie or are they just enamored by it's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it br br perhaps it is an anti clerical agenda that appeals to them hating the western religions of catholicism and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance just today it was revealed that the bbc routinely skews their broadcasts with anti christian anti western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness you can say anything you want about the bible pedopheliac priests the institutionalized cruelty of the church and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball but say one negative thing about non westernized religions and you are toast this movie was tailor made for such a sentiment with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching fawning fondling fumbling groping and patting of the backsides ewww br br and then there is the horse couplings photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry yes i understand the thematic relevance of the imagery large animal phallus's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers but if i wanted to watch horses you know do it i would like go live on a farm having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom br br is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants probably though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a monet painting complete with a spanning arched bridge and the ending which even i managed to be surprised by does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it that isn't fair and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about iwo jima whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it oscars because of it's noble message not because it is a particularly good or original movie br br while it may seem like an odd parallel i see one with the beast how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating and who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty somehow i managed to miss both points and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut and a great ending it's art for sure but it sucks hard br br 3 10
<START> i am marking this as a spoiler only because of some of my comments of the show's content not to the content itself br br as i read the comments it is apparent that those republicans somehow tolerate the show but disdain it while the democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness one reader even so it seems actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when bush was in grade school br br but as to the content as i see it trying to be neutral is that the group that made this series must actually be really bush haters in the episode that i saw last s02e03 it showed that the program must have been put together long before mccain became the front runner for the nomination because the other former front runners are all featured br br another thing that caught my attention was the use of add in closets i thought that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the u s a because i know of no home the u s a that does not have built in closets and most likely in the homes of the artists br br as i watch the show yes i do get caught up in it i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our president sure there are problems as most american will agree but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network so that if obama or hillary got in would they continue to produce and air the same sort of humor about them br br just one more comment on a commentator's remarks if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 according to that writer he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president wow wishful thinking on his part as far as 911 events i do believe that it was set in motion back when clinton was president and i can't see how if gore was president anything would be much different
<START> when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english sub titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd
<START> this is the neil simon piece of work that got a lot of praises the odd couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within you got felix ungar jack lemmon a hypochondriac fussy neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate oscar madison walter matthau a total slob these men have great jobs though felix is a news writer and oscar is a sports writer both of these men are divorced felix's wife is nearby while oscar's is on the other side of the u s the west coast well what can you say two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable it's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun i liked the part where when those two british neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after oscar kicked out felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier it's about time that felix needed to lighten up i guess all neat freaks neat to lighten up they can be fussy yet they should be patient as well a very fun movie and a nuevo classic neil simon's the odd couple is a must see classic movie 5 stars
