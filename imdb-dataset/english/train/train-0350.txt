<START> this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why even 45 years later it is quite an impressive piece of work why it isn't in print is a mystery that only disney can explain good use of live footage and animation in tandem this used to run as part of vault disney every few months or so but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while sigh most recommended

<START> this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that freddy's dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible 3 d ending and over the top corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano it's no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two postmortem appearances i would too if i went out like that this is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame
<START> this is a gorgeous movie visually the images of the mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their picturesque costumes all amount to a real work of art br br the story seems a bit loose but that's because it's not meant to be realistic it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated otherworldly atmosphere of latin america so far from god and so close to the united states the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden although there many layers of meaning br br if you can appreciate a slow moving richly textured movie this one is for you
<START> while flipping through the channels on a late saturday night my friends and i stumbled across this film first of all irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american seriously his accent was breaking through so much although his character was apparently scottish next i was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played james bond agent 007 at least twice this movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure the girl who played pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut and this film won an award i cannot believe it brosnan is an attractive man but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds we switched from kicking and screaming to this and we wanted to switch back we watched the 1995 children's classic the indian in the cupboard earlier in the night which also discussed the iroquois the following line represents our desire to run away take me outside earth grasper from grey owl if you don't like it you don't have to watch
<START> soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me i won't tell you what its about i'm sure you already read the summary this is a great doomed futureistic action science fiction movie kurt russell doesn't say much he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character there are great action and fight scenes some of the scenes are unrealistic but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites i'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy sci fi movies
<START> this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about 150 people to st george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st george temple not one person had dry eyes in the audience also there were some non religious and anti mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs br br i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through after all it is apart of american history
<START> wow that's about as much as i can say right now who writes this stuff who produces this stuff what self respecting actor would agree to 'act' in this stuff oh my god i don't know how i made it through this movie but i assume the fact that i had had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake good lord it was one of the most droned out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed and for the record i don't ever plan to 'witness' it again br br i first saw the film when i bought the dvd mistake 1 i mean i figured hey julia stiles i like her she's cool i'll watch it as soon as i get home mistake 2 i tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end really i did but i was unsuccessful it was one of the worst things i had ever seen i mean what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in 'parenthood' like ten years ago the 'jokes' and believe me it takes a lot out of me to call them that are stupid the characters are trite and forgettable the storyline is entirely predictable altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i'd never heard of this movie it was most likely a straight to dvd br br to anybody who may be thinking of watching this i have one piece of advice don't for the love of god don't i'm ashamed to have it in my dvd collection and i can't get rid of it nobody and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me and i'm talking second hand and third hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window that should let you know just how crap it is
<START> if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt 305 oklar as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt 305 oklar regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating to much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt 305 oklar was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt 305 oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt 305 oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work
<START> so many consider the black cat as the best karloff lugosi collaboration i disagree the invisible ray is their best a great storyline fantastic special effects and classic karloff over acting i love it
<START> george lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom the first episodes i saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom as i have watched this more there has been more more variety no one on the cast is really safe from his wit now br br it seems to me as this season has progressed that george is getting more comfortable with the family sitcom dad role at first he wasn't but he is getting more more into a groove this makes both him the shows progressively funnier they had added a couple of characters for george to play off this year too his wife's dad is getting more more involved in the plot br br his mom is still there but not as central as past seasons i think it is prudent to say with george's sense of comic timing abc's lack of good sitcoms george lopez has a good chance of being here on abc long after george w bush
<START> thomas ince always had a knack for bringing simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair the italian is such a film solid acting particularly by george beban father of silent child actor george beban jr and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in new york these give this 1915 film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintage br br the film begins with the modern day and a man george beban in modern clothes reading a story about an italian immigrant and then we transition into the story with george playing the immigrant he raises enough money to bring his fiancÃ©e from italy to america marries her and has a son with her but times are hard and the family struggles to survive i found myself wondering why the mother didn't breastfeed her child and avoid the complications with the dirty formula but oh well even the early dream factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in 1915 br br the best scene in the picture is when beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action very neat i loved the curtain effect it was great wonderful use of lighting in this film br br i give the italian an 8 out of 10
<START> i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horror movies and i really liked this one there were so many 'surprise' scenes what's the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when yoko's walking without her chin the make up is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without make up and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared
<START> while watching the film i'm not sure what direstion it was to take there's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well you can't do it all i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats ms mcteer is the film to add to her amazing talents her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged here is a british actress who can do anything in my view conflict is what makes drama and a great story i felt this film didn't have that everything was somewhat easy for the characters there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted watch the film for the sweetness but most of all for ms mcteer's brilliant performance
<START> steven spielberg at 24 had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called the psychiatrist starring roy thinnes one episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12 year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man clu gulager in his best performance who is dying of cancer both episodes were stunning visually unlike anything else on tv and emotionally complex and adult the creators of the psychiatrist were richard levinson and william link who created columbo and also produced its first season br br peter falk insisted on first rank experienced tv directors for the first season of columbo like bernard kowalski and jack smight but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of the psychiatrist br br spielberg says on the dvd of duel that he loved steven bochco's murder by the book script based on a levinson link story and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature even thought he had a lot less money to work with br br this episode of columbo is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other columbo episode even though the series always used top directors spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much but both actors are still a lot of fun spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner rosemary forsyth and barbara colby all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them the only columbo episode that was close to being as well directed is the by dawn's early light episode with patrick mcgoohan directed by harvey hart br br i think the two episodes of the psychiatrist and this episode of columbo suggest spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director he was great from the beginning in a combat dvd commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring albert salmi robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director maybe the same is true of spielberg
<START> there are pretty landscape shots writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths with lesser actors this show would be silly 'art must uplift humanity or it's bs ' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side the lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side wrong he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes there wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes the discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie i was moved only once towards the end the kid was way too passive the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous just my opinion but nowhere show for me
<START> yes this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre still i did not like this one at all about a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life crappy sex scenes to follow why are they crappy for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act i mean we watch porn for the sex do we not little girls blue also does things in an artistic way but it is still very erotic and nice to look at of course the girls in that one are very cute here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things if you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film the sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre i mean there is a snake in one of them people so for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all but rather turns me off
<START> bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for 2 i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one br br the movie is quite cliche 1970's and is quite groovy for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was br br the movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and wait for them br br if you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line either br br
<START> i couldn't wait to receive the dvd after hearing so much about the film what a disappointment this became one of the most confusing films i've ever viewed there were so many characters introduced some resembling others that it became impossible to follow the story line i could not understand how george clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved at least in the first half of the movie my wife and i gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the dvd i might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim a co worker told me that a lot of the movie comes together in the last minute or less i was glad i didn't waste another hour waiting i gave the dvd away the following day
<START> i think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made and i've seen many the book is better but it's still a very good movie
