<START> i have never seen one of these scifi originals before this was the first i think it only fair to judge the acting direction production set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair i will say however that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of werner herzog's masterpiece aguirre wrath of god br br i will begin by noting that yes i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture clash than it does with dinosaurs despite this being a made for tv sci fi movie there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine the symbolic elements included are evident enough br br consequently as a student of history theology mythology and film i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting i am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers as i said before the movie is what it is but what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity br br the main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character ayacoatl not a commentary on dichen lachman's performance but simply how her character was written although i'll say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy nods it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified her function in the film as the love interest of rios affirms that the european way is the right way simply because they are european there is really no other reason given it's really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress language ideology etc is more familiar to them than the aztec so therefore the aztec are portrayed as adversarial and 'backwards ' and it's not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan if not a better one to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks br br in fairness there is a subgroup of the spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native mesoamericans there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec they have agriculture medicine calendar etc but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie even over the 'thunder lizards' more on that later he his portrayed as treacherous duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic european spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native meso north americans again more on this later so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the spaniard br br now in analyzing the true nature of the story leaving the obvious christian vs pagan themes off of the table from a symbolic standpoint a viewer can easily take these so called thunder lizards to be representatives of the mesoamerican ideology theology which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on bloodthirstiness mercilessness cruelness wicked maybe even evil in opposition we have this group of christian wanderers led by a young hernando cortes who are portrayed as naive yet overall noble lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the aztec also the name of the film is aztec rex leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people however what aztec rex translates to is aztec king a the head of the aztec state or in this instance 'state of being ' hence why the title of the film was changed and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end it's the remaining spaniard rios aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which overcame through disease bloodshed war famine native americans rios symbolizes the ideal european as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered in opposition to cortes who represents the 'practical yet still noble european' but when you examine the holocausts of the americas let us be honest don't the symbolic components of this film's story have it backwards br br i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist or to be kind about it ignorant at best br br and yes i know it's just a movie all meant to be in fun i understand but so at the end we're left with the idea that rios was the father of the last remaining aztec lines i wonder what native mesoamericans would have to think about this ending as for myself i thought it was a little too self indulgent br br best supporting performance of the movie goes to ian ziering's wig although conspicuous it did at least alter ziering's appearance enough so that i didn't think i was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness ziering actually proves himself to be a more than capable actor in this movie i actually bought his performance or at least i forgot it was ian ziering anyway i don't know whom his agent is but he should get more work br br in closing it was also a pleasure to see jim mcgee again i've been a fan ever since his all too brief scene stealing performance in 1988's scrooged br br alexander quaresma deusexmachina529 aol com
<START> remember h g wells' the invisible man well here's another movie like it only more extreme hollow man is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes at first making the serum was the easy part making the person come back was not most of the first tries ended up unstable until one night when he perfected the formula and who else but caine would be the lab rat the gorilla was the first and almost died so when he came to it was a close one so when the did caine he decided to use it for fun then when he got tired of being not seen the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh however the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should and caine would delve into madness so he ends up being one mad invisible killer it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you i would care less about the ones who did you wrong great movie plenty of fun 3 out of 5 stars
<START> i being of puertorican descent had mixed fillings about this documentary first i was offended that ms perez compared senor campos to che guevarra also just a point of fact mr john leguzaimo is not of puertorican descent his parents came from columbia whomever did research on this was not very accurate i feel that the future of our race rests on education this message should have been resounding throughout this film education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus in my opinion this film swayed toward an anti american sentiment
<START> in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the 3 bins at walmart i just found dvd of yank tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rock bottom remainder br br i loved this film wish i'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything i'd have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly it's good for americans to stretch a little if the film's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema imitates life visa versa br br also i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me br br looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer director as well
<START> six degrees is a wonderful show i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 ' and to top it all off abc has now taken it off line so it is unable to be viewed online anymore why would abc create such a wonderful show with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows six degrees we will miss you
<START> i can't agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it's an all different matter i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a js's show ie there is no plot but the acting is wicked it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie br br it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america and i believe there are plenty of them are interested in after all it's the neighbours we're talking about don't we br br 100 fun
<START> 1st watched 2 2 2003 4 out of 10 dir jim kammerud brian smith drab and un spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated 101 dalmatians ' yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story which this one doesn't have the animation is also very un spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re do's etc etc probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
<START> a family affair takes us back to a less complicated time in america it's sobering to see how different everything was back then it was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a 'functional' family dealing in things together the film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the hardy family br br the film directed by george seitz is based on a successful play judge james hardy and his wife emmily are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with married daughter joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible at the same time another daughter marion brings home a beau who is clear will clash with her father the happy teen ager andy seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort polly to the dance something he is reluctant to do br br needless to say judge hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again after all he is a man that understands not only the law but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy br br lionel barrymore plays judge hardy with conviction he is the glue that holds everything together spring byington is seen as emily the mother mickey rooney has a small part in this film but he is as always fun to watch cecilia parker and julie haydon appeared as the daughters marion and joan sara hayden and margaret marquis are also featured in the film as aunt milly and polly the girl that surprises andy with her beauty br br a family affair is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an american family
<START> this deserves a 12 out of 10 an absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories this show needs to come back i've seen every episode and this is real quality br br the show centers around a couple of new yorkers plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives bridget moynahan and jay hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable caseman the scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite br br we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones br br if it never comes back six degrees will be sorely missed
<START> in theory 'director's commentary' should have worked the talented rob bryden plays peter delane a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are 'bonanza' 'flambards' 'the duchess of duke street' and 'the bounder' his commentaries are not the least bit informative due to his habit of wandering off the point br br but in practice it failed dismally it is a one joke show and the joke is not particularly funny the scripts are completely lacking in wit and bryden fails to convince as an old man whenever stuck for anything amusing to say which is like every five seconds he issues a hissing laugh rather than being amused by delane you want to shoot him if senile old men strike you as hilarious then this is for you br br it didn't help that the shows mocked were with the exceptions of 'mr mrs' and 'crossroads' rather good for the joke to work they needed to be really dreadful such as 'charlie's angels' 'o t t ' 'telly addicts' 'neighbours' and 'new faces' br br the show tanked big time so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if 'director's commentary' were someday itself the subject of a spoof
<START> this is absolutely the best none animated family film i've seen in quite a while back to the first homeward bound paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's pov it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films up to disney status imho
<START> once upon a time hollywood produced live action g rated movies without foul language immorality and gore splattered violence these movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions the heroes differed little from the crowd they shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens since the 1970s the film industry has pretty much written off g rated movies for adults basically modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet laced heavily with vile profanity mattress thumping sex and knuckle bruising fisticuffs these ingredients constitute the difference between g rated movies and those rated either pg or pg 13 br br miraculously director john lee hancock who penned scripts for clint eastwood's a perfect world 1993 and midnight in the garden of good and evil 1997 hits a home run with this g rated feel good four bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates america's favorite summer time sport but also extols the competitive spirit of the game essentially the rookie resembles the 1984 robert redford saga the natural about an old time slugger who makes a comeback unlike the natural the rookie shuns swearing sex and violence br br moreover rugged dennis quaid plays a real life individual jim morris' autobiography the oldest rookie big league dreams from a small town guy served as the basis for mike finding forrester rich's unpretentious norman rockwell style screenplay about white middle class aspirations morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999 although it doesn't belong in the same league with the inspirational james stewart classic the stratton story 1949 the rookie qualifies as the kind of movie that hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated br br hancock and rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism a wildcat oil prospector convinces two catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a west texas well fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill advised fantasy the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat st rita's patron saint of hopeless causes' to intervene the well gushes the town of big lake emerges and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they aren't drilling holes in the terrain the spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum meanwhile years later the u s navy doesn't keep jim morris sr brian cos of manhunter and his family in one place long before uprooting them the constant moving takes a toll on jim junior jim's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball br br nevertheless jim has baseball in his blood enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher's job in his texas hometown he organizes a baseball team like the foul mouthed bad news bears the rookie chronicles jim's triumph at turning losers into winners morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs he will try out for a professional baseball team predictably morris' students maintain their end of the bargain at age 35 jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles per hour the rookie never fouls out
<START> all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole br br as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would br br granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about br br as others have said 'bad' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad' you revel in that fact this film however is a void it's nothing br br furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way 'requiem for a dream' 'trainspotting' 'fear and loathing in las vegas' and 'candy' are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'go' overall both serious and funny and 'halfbaked' br br on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from 'lock stock and two smokling barrels' to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'loaded' is vile br br overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie
<START> la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time and what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by proust's a la recherche du temps perdu br br indeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first woman's name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandre's life and in the movie she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilberte's still coming when alexandre waits for veronika then totally that shows it's the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusions br br art is what causes the passage between what's outside the illusion of love to what's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art br br this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says art doesn't care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence first of all art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie that's why la maman et la putain doesn't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustache br br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a living dead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if he's writing his life you can guess that he's not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurse's room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel br br to explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzac's reader in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in proust's the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because they're stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and that's exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bresson's for example he's like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli's woman br br life is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if it's said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fears br br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions it's death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jean pierre lÃ©aud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sarte's huit clot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouvÃ© if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafÃ©s la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesn't become an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genette br br if like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain
<START> this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek the locations set designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek's story and this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn's role as father mentor lover and his portrayal of a man of men lost to a bygone era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence containment and security yes they do not make men like that anymore but then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek
<START> i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina br br henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david srathairn plays truman lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection br br there is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching
<START> i thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6 12 a little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true i think that it's a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them very 'cute' film bravo
<START> peter weir's first international success the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries david gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime' an alternate reality timeline central to native australian history and tribal custom heavy on atmosphere deliberately ambiguous in plotting the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects probably due to budgetary limitations nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you
<START> one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it to be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik christ its bad the prison guard hank is woeful too all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
