<START> with a movie called gayniggers from outer space how could you go wrong just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack and throw in tons of gay gags plot is unimportant too bad this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger one or two jokes work the rest fails br br the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film my expectation were to high apparently
<START> yeah i'm sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it i'm a big fan of the george romero movies and i'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie's devils it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad c movies c for craptastic then this is the movie for you or not
<START> woah is one thing i can say about this movie personally i'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie but i loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end br br i liked the movie but i have to admit it was because i found brian krause who played charles brady very very irresistible i guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie br br there was one thing that i was disappointed over i've watched charmed before and brian krause is married to holly marie combs his kissing scene was o k in sleepwalkers but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with holly marie combs i don't know if it is because krause and combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more that was the only disappointment in the movie but i guess it was made up for with brian krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie br br if you are use to seeing brian krause as holly marie combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie he was nothing like angle boy although now that i think about it it would be great to see krause's character on charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in sleepwalkers br br i also have to say the music was great in this movie too
<START> i love the frequently misnomered masters of horror series horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment projects like this and the similar greenlight project with gave us feast like it or lump it are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror br br this one began with a kernel of really kool idea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am i going with this br br i don't know how to spoil the spoiled but spoiler ahead all of a sudden no there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier we have long haired luminescent aliens huh huh brain drilling males and yeah i get it but well the worst curse of storytelling a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement br br cue to storytellers your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up not the other way around storytelling math 101 br br end of spoilers big oops
<START> the story young goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg in the institution she meets park il sun a young man who develops a bond with her br br if you're reading this you probably already know how talented chan wook park is but 'i'm a cyborg ' is a big departure from familiar and sadly stronger territory i'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different god knows we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas the main point about the movie i need to say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness or create a characters that you care about br br this story has to be one of the weirdest things i've seen in years but weird isn't enough there's no heart to the movie just surrealism and confusion confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie the characters all try to make sense of their own problems but it's chan wook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all
<START> this is one of my favorite mr motos and i have seen them all as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr moto lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator the usual comic relief is quite funny here and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye it's fast paced and fun br br the archaeologist doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas beck the usual second lead in these programmers but he's adequate stepin fetchit is on board and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny not demeaning to his intelligence and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen
<START> no i've never seen any of the santa slasher series i e 'silent night deadly night ' the original 'black christmas' or this one 'christmas evil ' i've heard all about their reputation or mads mothers against deranged santas i thought i would rent this one as i've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'fat guys at the movies' segment br br mothers should be against this but not for the ooooohhhh killer santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap boring long Â even at only 92 minutes crap br br little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 deliver presents eat some goodies and miraculously float up the chimney boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa sort of getting it on apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphie's dad got the leg lamp in 'a christmas story ' he was sooo disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own hand br br fast forward to the future now it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory we get a whiff of him being a little off kilter and he stalks both kids and parents alike who's naughty who's nice blah blah it takes a good two thirds of the film to get him to finally snap Â as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one no movie should take that long br br i will admit this movie had its tension building but only because i kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone when he finally does well punish who's naughty it's as graphic as a garbage pail kid card and i haven't mentioned the wtf ending i'm thinking it was a metaphor but in reality it's just as weird as the rest of the movie take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing and his solution isÂuh killing don't open this mess even on christmas eve or evil again i didn't watch the other santa slashers but this one sucked bad it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present
<START> i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not for those that have not seen it see it without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too check out the decontamination scene i gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than 7 years
<START> midnight cowboy is not for everybody it's raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to today's films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i can't forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can't forget it's also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
<START> lubitsch's last production but not his least interesting film somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn't finish it himself and as the movie wasn't co signed by preminger who he did most of the staging a very strange mix of musical a remembrance of the merry widow and classic lubitsch touch sentimentalism an impossible love story like cluny brown yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings prevailing on the foolishness of mankind and especially men in times of war with a moral lesson still true today as it was in 1948 billy wilder as an answer to preminger who grieved at lubitsch's funerals about having lost a great man replied that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that lady in ermine
<START> as other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography the colors are comic book bold i think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content despite its stellar cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre release press a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album i'm breathless music inspired by the film dick tracy which was a stratospheric hit due in large part to the inclusion of dance hit vogue which is not in nor has the slightest relation to this film i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie ins to madonna's i'm breathless album br br if you watch it at home by end titles you'll think there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back save yourself the wasted time do not bother with this
<START> yes giorgio is a feel good movie a little romance great music beautiful scenery comedy a great food fight and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes giorgio any movie buff would enjoy this film those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere most of us need a little escape now and then and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes ears and heart a must see
<START> i waited almost 25 years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of children's books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everything br br well not everything vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini's swanky score are the movie's two saving graces price is wickedly enjoyable and mancini more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity br br meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with inappropriately adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script blandly generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of disney's mid 1980s saturday morning tv shows br br this was a complete disappointment to me it's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh costing a fraction of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time br br the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini
<START> i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased when the show's run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes upsetting but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
<START> well when the cameo appearance of jason miller looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv is the high point of a picture what've you got br br it's a little bit country a little bit rock n' roll mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog dried mummy have you figured that one out yet dried in a bog in the basement christopher walken with a bad dye job and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they'd developed her br br i understand sort of that they're going back to visit her relatives after that br br problem there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing i think this is never connected to anything br br problem what do we need the grandmother for now the grandmother could be interesting she speaks gaelic or celtic or something maybe you can make something of her the best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit that's all br br problem they cast a real shifty character as the husband is he type cast will he sell his wife to the devil maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her or is he cast against type after all he has a good haircut and nice clothes he drinks he hesitates he's not a bad guy not a good one but dislikable why didn't they do something with him br br no problem an old boyfriend shows up the husband knocks him down he comes back to knock down the husband it gets pretty stupid but at least that character has motivation br br now she's an alcoholic he's an alcoholic he might only have married her for her money the grandmother is locked in the bedroom the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch are you following this who may come to life in fact you know she'll come to life the music swells a little girl lives in the house takes tea to the grandmother unlocks the door to do so and provides granny with cigarettes periodically granny gets out but nothing happens br br husband and wife lose the kid in the house subsequently lose their bedroom uncle gets his throat cut in the basement the leading lady has nose bleeds the husband drinks they both drink in the face of all of this the awful truth alluded to in the first over voice is omigod an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old br br in spite of all these dangling thread ingredients nobody managed to get a story on the screen no bridge between situations no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror just long slow scenes that go nowhere nbody really to care about and they had places to go with that aspect the innocent kid in the charge of drunks the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster but no her worst fault is smoking she's got great hair good makeup br br in short no plot just a little random predictable violence in a dark library with the rain gushing in and the sound track cuing us in you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie br br the production values were good oh nice scenery good wardrobe the cameraman at least knew what he was doing br br i bought it poor me
<START> i had low expectations for this movie but i was looking for something unchallenging for an evening i walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised this is a very fine baseball tribute film and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams dennis quaid does a masterful job with his role and i was touched by his performance definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time
<START> detective russell logan lou diamond phillips has a major problem on his hands the serial killer patrick channing jeff kober for whom psychic extraordinaire tess tracy griffith helped him capture has been resurrected with the first power given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber and can possess the bodies of the weak somehow russell who joins forces with tess who has an understanding of what they are up against will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands they will seek help from sister marguerite elizabeth arlen who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop channing a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of channing ridding the world of his evil she'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell who'll need all the help he can get when channing kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual ceremony br br in the film mykelti williamson always a reliable welcome supporting actor gets the partner of russell role so you know what will happen to him as in films of this type everyone around russell is dying but when he attempts to kill channing he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses br br pure occult rubbish stupid from the gate to the finish line phillips and griffith try i'll give them that but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance kober who is normally often always effective as the heavy is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips
<START> how powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be this film tells it's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within it's true as others have stated how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost hollywood is in it's special effects overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism so much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue one aspect that i really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion the older brother needed to say little as he usually did it was all there in that deadpan face of his beautiful cinematography wonderful acting great direction not to be missed
<START> this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really really sucks i normally sanctify stuff like this early 70's grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky low budget atmosphere usually rock house of seven corpses appeared to dispose of even more trumps since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including john carradine john ireland and faith domergue and the filming locations the titular house the graveyard are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences though sadly enough they're the only ones that qualify as such the credits are a splendid montage complete with freakish color effects and eerie freeze frames illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments someone falls down the balcony screaming a lady drowns in her bathtub and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr price carradine only fortify this reputation in other words the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director eric hartman john ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project the film within film structure is what mainly causes house of seven corpses to be so boring and uneventful a lot of movie material is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or Â even worse Â faith domergue and charles macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes the plot finally gets a little interesting only a little mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard the asthmatic judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses after a running time of approximately 60 minutes the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing i'm still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die for some reason i honestly regret confirming house of seven corpses is a pretty dreadful movie the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling but not nearly used to full effect and there's a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed numerous low budgeted 70's gems were stunningly gross so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film within film murders really don't count even the always reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and harrison's direction is completely uninspired not recommended unless you think the zero cool four and a half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy
<START> my what a director's intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions young mr lincoln is filled up with some 'old fashioned' values which in retrospect despite its two dimensional portrayal is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema what makes it work so extremely well as it does in all its simplicity and grandeur is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson br br we all know of abraham lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the civil war got assassinated but as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic funny in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman he's not some superhero that can do no wrong which was fonda's only apprehension to the part before signing on but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrong br br it's suffice to say that john ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying actually it's a lie he does try but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously zanuck so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in editing in camera and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story it's this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material as a kind of companion piece to the full blooded americana in 1939 as seen in mr smith goes to washington only here it's the law and not politics br br fonda is terrific in the lead his first with ford and never lets us loose sight of lincoln past the make up and extra boost in the shoes fonda's own personality in a sense as it would in grapes of wrath and my darling clementine comes out in the character of lincoln however unlikely it might be there's no one else from this period that could have played him then he's mature and wise but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he saw that but did she murder case br br only in little bits and pieces like that final shot which superimposes lincoln walking down the road with his monument and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on seem pretty dated as far as the goals set out with young mr lincoln there were all met by ford and his crew and cast it's not as hokey as one might think going in and it's got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos
