<START> i'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards or sympathy for sinatra in the other reviews here i've read elsewhere that sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for not being cast as sky masterson br br ok so who wouldn't want to be cast as sky masterson Â it's a great part the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet in which he must take salvation army sargeant sarah brown on a date to cuba or lose it's not the money Â it's the pride but he and she meet their match meanwhile nathan detroit must juggle his long suffering fiancÃ©e adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it doesn't alienate his fiancÃ©e forever first br br the film started life as a series of short stories by damon runyon that's his unique dialogue you hear and those are his great character names and that's his horse racing nightclub late night gambling world then it became a musical and you can't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage the camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably Â and not pleasingly Â flat and childlike fortunately the music is so great i don't care that much br br my absolute favourite thing about this film though is the singing and acting of the two non singers brando as sky and jean simmons as sargeant sarah brown of course putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto acting ability and pathos pathos pathos you're with sky as he argues with sarah against reason steadiness pipes and safety you enjoy sarah's loosening up under the influence of cuban milk you feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home as sky rightly says it's chemistry pro singers Â be they broadway belters or smooth crooners Â can't necessarily be relied on to make this happen and they certainly didn't i read somewhere that brando criticised sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of nathan detroit sinatra in turn was infuriated by brando's four take acting method as a brando fan does it show i'm bound to take the other side but i can't imagine that this film would have been the much adored classic it is today if brando and simmons hadn't been in it with their wonderful chemistry brando's unpredictability simmons' face all pink cheeks and brown hair drunk and ashamed in a cuban bar beautiful i'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case i need to feel good again you'll forgive me if give some of the nathan sleep talking parts the 100 brush off though won't you you won't oh be quiet and have some more of mindy's cheesecake
<START> i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible the pace was way too fast there was no plot and 'wowser ' what the hell is that it was 'wowsers '
<START> i went into this film expecting it to be similar to the matrix or pi boy was i wrong yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with cg animated cells and peptides to boot however the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feel good hogwash in between plot segments br br sure it stars off innocently enough there is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning it states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space however the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap saying that sub atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well the talking heads take it even further according to them the following are true br br when columbus arrived in the caribbean the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different meditation can reduce the murder rate with positive thought you can walk on water your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water br br and hey that's only in the first 40 minutes br br watching the movie was torture this film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult after doing my homework i realized that it basically is just that br br on the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy albeit one that's not funny br br save your time and money don't see this movie
<START> all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish how can that be funny of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner br br and why it that my guess is that it's because he should now better jim's not a stupid guy he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so but he chooses not to it's a conscious choice he makes when he chooses to not play with his kids not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy lady products and it's a choice he makes when he puts down his relatives br br the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to if the cheryl character was a real person she would have left him years ago and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years but alas she's just a catalyst for jim's quirky middle class extreme selfishness
<START> strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle aged man william h macy who finally decides to leave the family business murder for hire run by his quietly over demanding father donald sutherland while seeing a shrink john ritter and flirting with another patient neve campbell br br talk about a major dilemma but panic is a top notch thriller that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the stand outs here remarkable debut for first time writer director henry bromell i'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
<START> 'de grot' is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim krabbÃ© another of his books 'het gouden ei' was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called 'spoorloos' 'the vanishing' in 1988 this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called 'the vanishing' but there are times it comes close br br especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is egon wagter fedja van huÃªt coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like this br br from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him br br the movie is chronological in a way it shows egon and axel as kids than as students young adults and in their mid thirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults br br minor spoilers herein br br the title means 'the cave' and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well
<START> james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes i walked out before the end it was so bad so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo paul ross in one of the down market sundays i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets if he says the movie is good i get straight on this very website to check it out this movie should have gone straight to Â£1 99 dvd in a supermarket near you
<START> my brother tom br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format dolby digital br br following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor young jessica jenna harrison forms a relationship with a strange boy ben whishaw she meets in the woods unfortunately whishaw has secrets of his own no less troubling and far more dangerous br br dour drama sparked by brave performances by harrison and whishaw in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world' unfortunately their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude leading to an inevitable tragedy directed by dom rotheroe and photographed in digital video format the movie looks ragged in places too many awkward close ups and sloppy hand held camera moves and takes a while to find its feet but the dramatic pay off is quietly rewarding
<START> hiya folks br br well this movie sucks really think love actually in reverse nothing fits quite right nothing is coherent and certainly nothing makes you laugh love is rare in this film br br it is a total flop as indicated however there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film br br a with a star billing of jennifer love hewitt there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite hewitt with form fitting clothing to tell you now guys there are some promising scenes but it's really weak eye candy the possibilities here are watered down nevertheless i watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what titillating br br b the ending is romantic and positive that it's contrary and over the top is relevant yet for me was still a positive point br br c dougray scott plays an amourous friendly guy refreshing thank you br br 2 5 not worthy of your 10 or so dollars br br 2 3's of the way through i was convinced jennifer love hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend although i'll take that back for now it hinges greatly on her next film br br oh and her sister is way stupid her husband is way stupid and what the heck she's way stupid br br next time can't wait for the next love actually with jlh
<START> is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch phat beach however don't rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistake br br i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at kind of watch something like hoop dreams or jason's lyric if you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amused br br 3 out of 10
<START> i found this movie to be very good in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters especially ms stone and morissey tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute the plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie before it even started you won't regret it if you go see it
<START> ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into then the one with the boy was completely retarded it wasn't even scary his dream sounds like a little kid's bedtime story then the news girls one was completely retarded too i'm sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t v and he said all that junk to her next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people omg its so stupid i'm not even going to say any more about it the last one was the best it wasn't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something then when they're all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus to hell ahahahah and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus ha the end
<START> this is a really heart warming family movie it has absolutely brilliant animal training and acting if you can call it like that as well just think about the dog in how the grinch stole christmas it was plain bad training the paulie story is extremely well done well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too not more to say except that this is a great movie br br my ratings story 8 5 10 acting 7 5 10 animals fx 8 5 10 cinematography 8 10 br br my overall rating 8 10 big family movie and very worth watching
<START> dr seuss' how the grinch stole christmas 2000 out of four br br if you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable don't see dr seuss' how the grinch stole christmas if you are old enough to read this review then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction joyous load noises and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do br br many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read however i will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the whoville festival and the dr seuss vision of the mean one robbing the who's from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes regardless there is snl's molly shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor momsen jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator and christine baranski is the grinch's lone lost lover br br the filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself all of the other characters are puppets of the plot shapeless and uninteresting and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic example grinch oh the who manity br br the movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith the costume designer rita ryack and the ample makeup department how the grinch stole christmas is a very good looking production the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of whoville are plastered with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines although dazzling i really can't give credit to the performances for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place br br jim carrey is one actor who i can talk about his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences no laughs come from jim carry's zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas br br after this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave br br
<START> a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion br br the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick but it also carries a message br br a good film again from korea
<START> i haven't really seen too many of the columbo films actually i think i've only watched one or two apart from this one i've always liked columbo though somehow without even having seen that much of him peter falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character because of his looks his voice and his charm the perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968 the latest and probably not last of the films was made in 2003 that's 35 years and falk was 40 back when he made the first one the series consists of 68 films unless my count is off all of which are made for tv everyone knows the character even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema that is quite an accomplishment if you ask me the plot is pretty good the only problem i have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning though that may be the same for all of the columbo films leaving no mystery but how columbo solves it making it somewhat dull since there's not much to look forward to at the end of the film the pacing is good there's hardly a scene where you're bored the acting is very good particularly that of falk and ruth gordon they have some great exchanges of dialog in the film the characters are well written and credible the dialog and script is unusually good for a tv movie all in all the film is yes surprisingly good for a tv movie and definitely worth watching for any fan of columbo and or crime mystery flicks 8 10
<START> what can i say i think i have to write spoiler alert and then reveal they used the f word a lot in this movie like in every two sentences i did not like this movie at all too much hints on sexual perversions sidesteps and cheating and that swearing was totally out the window i gave this movie 3 and two of those points are for mira sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor
<START> tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years no grant character transformations no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic the balance in speed in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied the fact that this film is about nothing merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining it is brilliant because it is empty in between the lines it is happening to see or not to see that's the
<START> father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried roy shows indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny fotp is not a kiddie cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original i've seen most of those stereotypes many times before even in that particular order
<START> two years passed and mostly everyone looks different some for good and some for worse i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though br br some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as attractive as she was in the original br br though costumes like batman batgirl killer croc and scarecrow look badass especially scarecrow br br the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin tim drake while nightwing dick grayson comes to the rescue often batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass br br the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite over the edge might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out br br overall 8 9 10
