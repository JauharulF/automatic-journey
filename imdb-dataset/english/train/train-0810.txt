<START> true the setting in paris is great the actors are fine the story is a twisted morality play is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough it's ok to hurt everyone else along the way in a real romance you sort of want less clichÃ© than the man who has become bored with his wife and is willing to dump his family and the woman who is ok with encouraging him to do this so what if they are decent looking and if karen allen shows off her body the characters are still self absorbed and reprehensible maybe the moral of the story is you get what you deserve i give it a 4 only for the fast scan potential through the male interest bits
<START> madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today br br celebrities party endlessly they like to be seen at these parties and to get due exposure in the media in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a i need you you need me kind of relationship however the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa anyhow in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column page 3 of the newspaper reporter konkana sen sharma she is shown as this celebrity maker very popular at the social gatherings she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit bikram saluja she rooms with an air hostess Â the sassy pearl sandhya mridul and a struggling actress gayatri tara sharma the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios exploitation of power hunger for media exposure into all this is layered in homosexuality a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot rampant drug use pedophilia police encounter deaths in light of all this pearl's desire to have a super rich husband a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car the bitching women all seem benign ills br br the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma atul kulkarni has almost no role Â a pity in my opinion but the supporting cast is more than competent boman irani is very good this is what saves the film for me mr bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients the film is a brave albeit flawed effort certainly worth a watch
<START> this movie promised bat people it didn't deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the seizures and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess we'll never know
<START> this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot there's not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they participated etc br br it's a document br br it's mind blowing br br i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this br br nb the producer doesn't have the rights to distribute a dvd version i've also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs
<START> a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event br br i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie br br the production values hey it's an independent movie with a shoe string budget so ya it's going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is a list hollywood fare but properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable more important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself is the story compelling do the dramatic moments work does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax the answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes as a side note the truly important technical stuff continuity sound lighting are fine the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship br br content value the message of the movie is superb when you consider how many ideas the movie maker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry he presents the message of salvation the consequence of unbelief the danger of backsliding the truth of the rapture and the threat of a world dominating satanic government with flare imagination and most importantly for an evangelical movie with biblical accuracy br br the movie maker is a good storyteller for example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways 1 he shows us through action the reality of jesus christ's sacrifice for our sake this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake poison the poison is like sin the cure is like christ's blood shed on the cross 2 the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ so the movie maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story br br as a side note the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation couched in explicitly evangelical christian language imagery and theology is also perfectly acceptable to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd it's akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport wear what else would evangelical christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case also the fact that the movie maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is again perfectly acceptable the movie maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably how do i know i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later how many movies can you say that about all around a very enjoyable thought provoking show i plan on showing it to my teen group at church
<START> if you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie then i highly recommend this one if you aren't stay away this is an astonishingly cheap looking movie and at times you may find yourself wondering if it isn't just a prank someone is pulling on you the most positive comment i can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super low budget nonsense so there is at least a sense of fun here br br but this is as amateurish as it gets their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads it's obviously not meant to be taken seriously to say the least but even with that disclaimer you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all or laughing out loud frequently as i did
<START> joe buck jon voight decides he's going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building br br there isn't much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck's plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody's talking' we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won't and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this br br a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso's reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser
<START> if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see it br br house of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance br br the story is taut and well crafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual self esteem is a key part of her motivation i'll say no more br br house of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards
<START> the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium are fine you see real chaos on the set a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown the cool has been director mickey rourke the bad tempered star etc you have seen everything before but it's well done but then the rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again no climax no dramatic development no good acting not even bad acting it just goes on and on and on mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet altogether that makes 12 good minutes br br
<START> when setting out this film director mary harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of bettie page's career from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth br br when you think of someone who had page's career you'd think that there would be plenty to discuss her reasons decisions life event personal traumas but harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse domestic violence and a gang rape but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again you get the impression that harron and guinevere turner co writer wanted to gloss over anything that wasn't glamorous and flattering you go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots br br all in all the film really frustrates you as you watch desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself how did she balance her religion with her job what made this young tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography the film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she's told but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation this was after all the 50s br br it seems to me that harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous and although this is true she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience this woman was a central part of a senate hearing on juvenile delinquency but no one is ever really shown as shocked br br basically i left this film just thinking how tame it was harron and turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer they come across as two lifelong fans of miss page and are desperate to make sure that nothing absolutely nothing could possibly put a bad light on their heroine and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems and all that's left is the string of events that made up her career without any substance whatsoever behind it
<START> ok i will admit it started out very pleasing and good but then it just dropped downhill i cannot believe sarah michelle gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie was i wanted to see the twist at the ned and to my surprise well folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one because the end just leaves you confused and then the credit role i was like what the hell this did not deserve a theater run i am sorry but it didn't i mean it was horrible the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts thats it you can watch it im not telling you not to hey you might even like it or even love it but if you hate it don't say i didn't warn you
<START> hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren't really interested in what puts protagonists into danger only that they are in danger and need to escape br br this film proves hitchcock was not 100 correct police believe jean simmons is guilty of a crime when she plainly isn't trevor howard decides their best course of action is to run for it and so the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains buses and coaches jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall scrambling across dockyard roofs br br all good exciting stuff but i couldn't get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary they should have stayed put br br in other words the macguffin wasn't strong enough
<START> ok let me say that i didn't expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold all i asked for was it to be cinematic and it wasn't even that it looked like someone's bad home movies poorly acted scripted and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people i've ever seen br br the film's plot focuses on a low class family who decide to go on the jerry farrelly show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother daughter stepfather and the daughter's fiancee from there the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience white trash pornography there's redneck sex interacial sex even sex between jerry and his wife yuk this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision at least it was mercifully short disgusting and degrading african americans and working class america should be offended howard stern should be pleased however he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom his was smart funny and entertaining br br my grade f the daughter was hot
<START> i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it it might be a little like pretty woman but i haven't seen that and i don't think it's any better than this i don't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie and to those who say it's not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don't like it as for rani mukherjee i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever
<START> i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema pasolini etc by that time gone br br the hollywood epic films are good for fun perhaps this 'odyssey' had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for pop corn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflections br br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but it's italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
<START> wow i'm a huge henry viii tudor era fan and well this was interesting the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one and wow just wow i've seen bad acting before but this reached new heights when the actress who played catherine was umm crying she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times many many times funny funny stuff the only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing anne boleyn i might be prejudiced though i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn she was a really facinating woman read up on her it's worth it also i have read a lot about the tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed they were all very stereotypical only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock
<START> this is kind of a weird movie given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his minions but it's still kinda fun br br it has some genuine laughs whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable though this movie is not good but i can say i really enjoyed watching it br br i would recommend this movie over santa claus conquers the martians santa claus with dudley moore and john lithgow or the santa clause with tim allen
<START> watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life if nothing catastrophic happens before i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movie or financed deserves a kick between the legs because that's where they were thinking when they made this movie it's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girls and such only the fat guy doesn't get a girl skin flicks don't annoy me i take 'em for face value but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick it's about fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies only he has his lady anyways the dialogue is super horrible for even a c movie it supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development it's a glorified porno movie without any porn in it never ever watch this movie
<START> i originally watched 8 simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked when they didn't show it any more was annoyed but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series i didn't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it's old excellent standard i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed rory is also good he shares my name and grampa as well i'll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
<START> i've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years since my 5th grade teacher a native texan told stories of ones he saw in his youth fortunately i've lived my whole life in the middle atlantic states where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as the ones in the midwest but i have had two close encounters one in pa and the other in nj in the past decade br br i enjoyed the family scenes particularly the conflicts between jack and dan hatch when the tornado was close dan knew most of what he had to do and he probably learned this in school since i know that tornado safety is an important subject in parts of the u s where these storms are more frequent however characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe to do in tornadoes but are actually not supposed to be done or are unsafe br br when the siren first sounded dan and arthur went through the house and opened the windows for years this is what people were told to do but tornado safety web sites now advise against doing this also people were shown hiding in a highway underpass this method was made popular by an early 1990s video made by a t v crew during a relatively weak twister in kansas however in the most serious tornadoes people can be sucked out from these underpasses this happened during a may 1999 outbreak in oklahoma br br the tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall which is not a common time for them to happen then again one of my close encounters took place in late september also they traveled from northwest to southeast while most such storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northeast however this is not all that unusual a famous tornado that struck joliet il in the early 1990s traveled in that direction as did the one involved in my other close encounter br br i think that the movie should have been set in the spring this movie was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event that happened on june 3 1980 but it was still a compelling story
