<START> the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one there are a few things that derail this film br br first tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals in my opinion any footwear on tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle br br second the character of benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil to me his character is unnecessary to the film's plot br br also while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan it's apparent that he was not in his best shape although in his later jungle jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this film br br the octopus battle is a terrific idea but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate br br and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesn't manage to salvage this last weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run
<START> i was pleased to see that she had black hair i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories br br i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn't spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well br br i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the books br br i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
<START> imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there that's what happens with this film br br the opening showed promise but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re hash of 'mis understood brooding bad boy' andrei meets 'innocent whimsical beauty' paula br br rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the money shot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty thence follows a string of insincere and heavily clichÃ©d love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical poetic fluff andrei's admission of being eponymously a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have but even when we're told in heavy underlined writing who and what he is it's still difficult to believe it or care br br for a byronic hero antihero to work the story needs subtlety style and innovation all of which are utterly absent here this is not a modern day phantom of the opera it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny slippers br br the performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly' no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part this is not his best work the glimmers of interest were brought by jÃ¼rgen prochnow as 'vashon' and andrew lee potts as the young photographer brother a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead
<START> panic in the streets opens in high noir style a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window behind which is playing out a sleazy card game an opening flourish which along with some of the location shooting anticipates some of the atmosphere welles brought a decade later in touch of evil one of the players throws open the window it's an appropriate action serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld br br shot in high contrast black and white panic in the streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in new orleans scenes set in such places as the mortuary the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'frank's place' offer a unique and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere impossible to recreate in the studio with these elements kazan's film shows the influence of dassin's groundbreaking naked city of two years earlier which established the gritty almost documentary style within the noir cycle in fact widmark's previous role had been in dassin's even finer night and the city a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent joe macdonald a favourite with the director photographed panic in the streets' detailed environment macdonald also worked on kazan's pinky and viva zapata and went on to shoot widmark again three years later in fuller's masterpiece pick up on south street br br as others have noticed in a manner typical of some noir films kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest calm home life of the reeds but whereas for instance in lang's the big heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance panic in the streets places reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day' despite all the danger ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied the implication being that social balance has been restored at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills br br that imbalance of course has been created by crime and disease the two are closely associated in this film it reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder cobra 1986 where crime is the disease meet the cure a neat analogy in context if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism at its climax as blackie attempts to flee aboard ship the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals both posing a menace to society's health as the presumably infected blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies in search of something he suspects everyone is after if without knowing exactly what it is 'plague' and 'blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind adding further to connected associations ironically blackie's hunch about poldi's unfortunate cousin that he brought something in of note is correct even if finally its nothing he can sell or steal blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it and his so confusion is understandable br br dr reed although home loving and on the side of society is a true noir hero familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone forced to travel beyond the limits of the law in his way reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite given director kazan's controversial personal history the director testified before the infamous huac naming suspected communists and fellow travellers his film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning and the manhandling of the press on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means these actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time presumably accepting the mccarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry in these times of terrorist threats and state response such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern br br standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where blackie interrogates the dying poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband cat like blackie stalks his victim across the room eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed holding poldi's feverish head in his hands a striking evil cradling it's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption whether moral or physical apparently the actors did many or all of their own stunts which leads to some other very dramatic scenes at the end as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs half crawling half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for palance but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all br br occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer apparently dr reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup perhaps just as astonishingly he never inoculates himself inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises at the end of the film too the potential epidemic has been halted all contactees located a little too neatly but these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today
<START> i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time what stood out for me was the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through they don't break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on br br these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track they're not that different loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no woog and dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality br br now what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr screweyes and the addition of him halfway through the movie though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half br br considering the target audience who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think
<START> i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander leesville louisiana i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander br br leesville louisiana
<START> spoilers throughout br br the gettaway is mostly an action movie and what action there is to shootouts chases dumpsters and much much more it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy's br br this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry but the movie itself didn't do it for me br br the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly the plot is overshadowed by one fight chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in in fact by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning i don't think bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture br br this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen certainly not but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here the gettaway isn't terribly original either and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull it really could have been better i think br br bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives sometimes less is more after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale didn't enjoy this one to much
<START> call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine it was so well made well written well acted well directed etc everything about it was wonderful there were parts that were relatively routine lily's death very funny www bleed me dry com completely horrifying and creepy paige's death and just plain heartbreaking the first scene i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards both of whom i met and got autographs from during the filming of this movie very nice people and marley shelton br br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone this movie is in no way a scream clone in fact this film runs rings around scream it actually makes sense scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too ahem friday the 13th halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers i also think that the novelty of the cupid masked killer is brilliant it's so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things another novelty the nose bleeding makes way for a fantastic ending the ending gives me chills every time i see it so even if you didn't like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chance br br ps keep an eye out for my new website www love hurts org coming soon
<START> this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt
<START> i was aware of rohmer's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures as renoir's or chaplin's very last movies yes the politique des auteurs also has its dark side but with les amours d'astrÃ©e et de cÃ©ladon it's as if rohmer himself wanted for what may be his last movie to perpetuate this tradition of great directors who made a last senile movie by adapting urfÃ©'s l'astrÃ©e with ridiculous aesthetic codes witch just look like a parody of rosselini's last movies the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx's lives br br in his version of perceval rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved and films actors dressed like 1600's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees it's not that the story itself is stupid but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny and i'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly the ridiculous soft erotic tone the poor musical tentatives or the strange fascination for trasvestisment br br the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke which mixes a soft erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions sic at the beginning of the movie rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity and that's why he had to film l'astrÃ©e in other parts of the country however i'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions this film may interest a few historians but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer's movie
<START> i don't know much about film making but good movies have to tell some sort of a story your characters have to start and complete their journey in last exit to brooklyn they may but its not in any satisfying way and i'm not meaning a happy ending just any ending br br last exit to brooklyn set in 1952 brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike sets a number of story threads in motion most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion it leaves some of them dangling with no ending or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an artistic ending br br two cases in point and they contain spoilers br br a sad transvestite character an important character in the film is struck by a car and killed and that's it for him in the movie he's gone for good erased from everyone's memory no reactions from his friends enemies lovers nothing br br in another thread the stupid clueless and secretly gay strike leader having been rejected by labor his gay lover and found out by the neighborhood thugs gets stomped by the thugs the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn and the streetlights are very very similar to those of nazi death camps and the scene drags on and on and on and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader and he's been crucified ppppuuuulllleeeeeez and of course that's it for him too brain erasure gone br br bottom line no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film this movie is a depressing piece of sludge avoid it and if you don't be forewarned it really deserves an nc 17 rating for massive amounts of physical emotional and sexual brutality don't even let the teenagers watch
<START> they really can't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning the problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president br br trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular but of course she comes out of all that the girls go through drunken rages exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense br br it really can't get much worse than this awful film
<START> not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot during the whole film i was like erm what is this movie all about i don't get the animations at all probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s during the film there is a group of people walked out after the movie many people said that's it frankly speaking i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award if you are thinking of watching this film i strongly recommend you not to you will regret it i'm not joking you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it
<START> this is a great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid it doesn't help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when i was ten turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but i love it now as a 24 year old br br i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd this movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this one's for you 9 10
<START> i do see what my forebears saw in the youthful bette davis she's splendid throughout this almost madcap political comedy which actually stars warren williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony vivienne osborne is brilliant as his ex and i found myself rooting for her throughout the williams character is not at all sympathetic and he's not even a decent op br br guy kibbee is one of the best at what he does as a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the progressive party if you're of a political mind you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional progressive party of williams and kibbee i could draw exact parallels but we're not here for that br br this is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies if you've ever watched any of the old wheeler woolsey titles half shot at sunrise the rainmakers you'll find frank mchugh as williams's right arm looking and behaving a lot like bert wheeler he had me fooled br br yes both my wife and i recommend this one
<START> in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over gotta love her she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but instead she ran i mean she didn't wanna bring guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility
<START> i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a glove i don't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
<START> along with brothers sisters six degrees was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006 br br great cast all around but really enjoyed the work of campbell scott the come back photog and hope davis recent widow of journalist killed in iraq br br aside from the acting the writing was fresh and the acting superb the show was also shot in nyc the real city not the warner bros or some other studio's backlot adding a secondary layer or realism br br i guess people are more interested in the latest survivor and other reality garbage too bad it didn't last
<START> yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but i'm the kind of die hard dragon world ending holy crap action movie fan br br but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me br br the 3d graphics were pretty damn good i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had the fight between good and evil at the end was i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty good br br now on to the parts that i think could have been better the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles i mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvder br br overall i loved the movie but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well
<START> this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie making it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable from the unrealistic to the ludicrous br br the unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two british soldiers and a hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent indians in the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush in the british army a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt and if you get past that he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand the indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers of course not at one point we see the british soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back the water boy bravely blows a bugle which comes from nowhere to sound the alarm this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do this scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy they should have hired keaton and done it better
