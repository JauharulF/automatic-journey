<START> elephant walk 1954 starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler adventure flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too
<START> this show is one of the worst shows of all time absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late like in 2009 they will finally say something about michael vick's dogfights all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on s n l but had to go to the lowest of the low mad tv its an hour of mad magazine jokes witch aren't funny to begin with told by terrible john stewart wanna bees so if you have any problem tell me id love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show family guy put it well osama bin ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look the cast of mad tv there is a reason why no one watches the show
<START> personally i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy and brando should have won for best actor anyway the movie is awesome the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it do so and fall in love
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films professor noodle lucien littlefield is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula with the ability to reverse ageing after twenty years ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic after breaking an extension stan gets a replacement a loaded gun from off the wall and of course it fires the brush off stan goes up to have a look and ollie standing on the attic door of the roof falls into the greenhouse stan asks if he was hurt and ollie only answers with i have nothing to say ollie gets back on the roof and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney ollie hatless in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down and the butler jessup sam adams is covered in chimney ash smoke oh and ollie still has nothing to say to stan the boys decide to clean up the mess and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel ollie asks can't you do anything right and stan replies i have nothing to say getting the shovel bashed on his head as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes they get distracted by a painting on the wall and the ashes end up down ollie's trousers so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head professor noodle finishes his formula and does a final test on a duck with a drop in a tank of water changing it into a duckling he also shows the boys his success turning the duckling into an egg and he next proposes to use a human subject i e his butler while he's gone the boys decide to test the formula for themselves but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula in the end what was once ollie comes out an ape and when stan asks him to speak all ollie ape says is i have nothing to say and stan whimpers filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian very good
<START> to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else some expletives might describe it but still too positively normally one ignores this kind of rubbish but it was so stupid that one can but despair would have though that even americans and commercial tv stations would have given this piece of s t a miss but as the germans say gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens
<START> this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics spider man has been framed by a mysterious impostor the city is being overrun by a strange gas and symbiotes like those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city who is behind these crimes could it be doc ock well he seems to have turned over a new leaf venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery the fighting is basic not to hard to pick up the fights with the bosses are rather fun you get to collect comics you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city however that is also a weak point the swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as spider man seemingly attachÃ©s his webs to the sky you also do not have much maneuverability web slinging either especially compared to a say spider man 2 movie video game still it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story so be prepared to see scorpion rhino venom mysterio doctor octopus and carnage for one wild action packed ride
<START> how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach br br it's actually a story of sidney young simon pegg breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way simon pegg made an ok appearance slightly worse than his usual movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments and those moments are really hilarious br br i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit relax and enjoy movie for what it is if you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it
<START> it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping and no one can do that better than little richard the man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll br br look to leon to provide a definitive characterization as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptations and jackie wilson in mr rock 'n' roll the alan freed story br br this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father with his church and with himself over just who he was he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style
<START> problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents but he gets into trouble later that junior can drive grandpa's car he can scare people with a bear he can put a room on fire it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth a sequel is an even worse fate rent chicken run instead br br 1 2 out of i give it
<START> do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation technically i am a boomer though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the '60s were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br this is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up
<START> nyc 2022 the greenhouse effect vanished oceans grinding unemployment and scarcity of water power and food and new york's population has topped 40 million this is a little gem of a picture not least because a resource depleted future is a reality for us 21st century citizens br br the low budget opening titles of this movie are great set to music a low tech 'tape slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973 depicts an unspoiled american pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes succinct and unambiguous it's truly memorable budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints at odds with the story's brilliant premise the police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's tv detective show and the other interior sets look basic at best the budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise' the soylent executive's 'chelsea west' apartment with state of the art goodies meaning the other costumes are perfunctory some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter br br the memorable scene where sol and thorn charlton heston share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society they enjoy real bourbon lettuce celery tomato apple and beef and we really sense their lip smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges br br robinson's pivotal death scene in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'home' depicts him immersed in images of the world's once beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted among other horrors br br this is one smart film and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s yes i know we're not eating the dead yet but with our resource sapping longevity spiraling poverty gap corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change the lasting prediction of 'soylent green' may come to pass
<START> this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors so what went wrong i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twists devices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film
<START> i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed br br documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed i've seen all of wood's films and they're just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didn't try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s still it's of interest if you're a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend
<START> this movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing not the best abc family film if you ask me if there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations there's really no reason for them at least this is a tv movie i wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it if you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them
<START> i have read the whole 'a wrinkle in time' book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting br br a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find meg's father and get off the island camazotz br br the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations aren't necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straight to video acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a 0 but sadly i can only give it 1 a half could have been useful
<START> power rangers the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it's complete cheesiness and awful settings br br this show was not entertainment it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences br br the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such br br i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was br br as such it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made
<START> for a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem imagine a movie where joe piscopo is actually funny maureen stapleton is a scene stealer the moroni character is an absolute scream watch for alan the skipper hale jr as a police sgt
<START> this movie is actually funny if you'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it it's called blonde and blonder so don't expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes it's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if you're not too sober lol pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks it's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art c'mon this movie is about blondes it's supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
<START> the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african american entertainers of the '30s than any denigration of the entire race stepin fetchit caricature notwithstanding besides who i just mentioned there's also frog or fish versions of cab calloway fats waller joesphine baker bill bojangles robinson and louis armstrong this happy harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be if not they're certainly very flattering impersonations even the lazy shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as hold that tiger plays on the score highly recommended for fans of '30s animation and jazz music
<START> i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo michelangleo raphel and donatello so venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle
