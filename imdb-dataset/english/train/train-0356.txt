<START> i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday i don't know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet br br first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough the gadget mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all br br the plot is non existent there's something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all i got what the deal was with the short giant italian guy i will never know it had nothing to do with anything br br and if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever and he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also br br i wasn't impressed at all this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it
<START> movie had some good acting and good moments though obviously pretty low budget but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money also several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is apologizing to adam for his past while adam is shown to be upstanding and traditional which the film proclaims to be the good way in the end i don't like being preached to like that i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in glenn's shoes and he said he does in real life relate to glenn's view that he could never date someone with adam's views well then i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film also director said he directed this his first movie only after reading directing for dummies directing was not that bad but far from a top notch effort i've seen worse but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated
<START> loony tunes have ventured at least twice into the future the first time was with the brilliantly funny duck dodgers the latter time was with this Â um Â effort loonatics unleashed isn't without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn't up to warner brothers quality wb cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children these pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up br br the premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals 2 bunnies a tasmanian devil a duck a roadrunner and a coyote live on the city planet of acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 what's confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count up to 2772 from the 21st century cute but frelling stupid br br in each episode the super sextet Â amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter Â fight various super villains for the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh Â the usual evil laugh of course why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always Â always Â laugh evilly at every opportunity animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople and or henchthings br br in point of fact the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get go the superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not the problem here is that we don't see enough wb looniness lexi and ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as bugs like what we have here is basically the silly and drekish teen titans including its overly modern animation look but with animals feh br br the other misstep by the program's creators is or are the villains as noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil laugh bit excessively amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists adding to the fun could have been say jupiter sam Â as well as the fudd still hunting wabbits Â as well as tech e coyote converted into a really neurotic villain Â and so on ah the sadness of missed opportunitiesÂ br br sadly this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is a 2nd season nevertheless we can rejoice that there's something new out there for the 14 going on 9 crowd the rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of duck dodgers
<START> after seeing arthur on tv numerous times i laughed so hard dudley moore's role as arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but john gielgud as his servant father figure hobson was equally charming i bought the dvd a few weeks ago and watched it despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was liza minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic br br arthur bach moore is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child his activities are supervised by his dry english butler hobson gielgud it appears that nobody really cares about arthur except for him arthur's father barbour offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite susan johnson eikenberry in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars br br however arthur meets and falls in love with linda marolla minnelli a young working class waitress and tie thief now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money when hobson dies arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with susan before the wedding leaving him to keep both the money and his true love br br arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone
<START> i thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful it was slow pretentious and boring i almost fell asleep there are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out yaowwww while someone taps randomly on a wooden object that being said there are some pretty songs but it's not worth seeing hte movie over go on itunes they have the album preview it and choose the good ones br br half the movie is some guy making tea well that's a slight exaggeration but you'll see what i mean if you see it that being said don't see it
<START> it's hard to rate films like this because do you rate it on production or just fun br br i saw this film back in about 1988 89 or so when i was a boy and i'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere what is important are the fight scenes while a 'little' sparce are really good br br i must say it was better when i was a boy only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film but as a sit back with a few beers martial arts film i can't fault it it delivers and is much better than the mountains of american ninja style rubbish that was churned out in the 80's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes br br in an interesting note dusty nelson the writer and director of sakura killers did another ninja film under the bonaire movie flag called white phantom i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to sakura killers but the sakura clan is once again a main feature including the same logo and similar story only this time including a white ninja this too while being mostly dire had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank are pretty awful br br so if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours
<START> i attended camp chesapeake it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md it was a similar type summer camp with cabins it was established by the coatesville pa ymca i started out as a young camper and later became a junior senior counselor and later the waterfront director if the camp had continued i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature the 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings a black man by the name of curtis ford and his family were residents and caretakers of the property mr curtis was my friend and mentor i idolized his every being even as he could not swim he was a waterman if i asked him where the fish were biting he would designate the spot and i would have a ball ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer these memories will be with me for eternity
<START> faith and mortality viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewish american gentleman and a younger african american jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years br br mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems and a terminally ill wife belafonte's character is a career hustler never settling on a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory he must convince mostel to renew his faith as it has been failing along with his wife's health and his own but belafonte's levine has his own problems still pining for the girlfriend he left behind br br belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should and so the the ending is cryptic and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending br br this is not a 'typical' hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors
<START> i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what's up tiger lily with this film br br it has to be one of the worst french films i've seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time br br it's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film br br lou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent br br avoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d'artagnan
<START> the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her br br after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love overcame all the obstacles
<START> i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video finally it's out it was made in brazil so i assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out it is one of my all time favorites but be warned it is weird like werner herzog weird its weirdness stems from its super realism br br the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago in pre colonial times when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy so they intend to kill him before they dispatch him though they make him part of their tribe their custom the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe that's it cosmic plotline no intense insight into the variety of human life definitely br br oh yeah be warned this film has definite nudity this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages this film tells it like it was re read above national geographic super realism br br
<START> i bought this video at walmart's 1 bin i think i over paid in the 1940s bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd rate movies for small studios in this case monogram the ones who made most of the bowry boys films while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ed wood classics such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die hard fans br br i am an old movie junkie so i gave this a try besides a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good just not this one br br lugosi is what else a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all br br anyways a really annoying female reporter a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen so she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand eventually the maniacs all die mostly due to their own hands and all is well at the conclusion the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry and naturally the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs if you haven't noticed there's a lot of fainting in this film or maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep
<START> all the other comments already said what i was going to say here goes anyway i thought this was italian at first sorry about that italy i wasn't bored because i kept waiting for something to happen who did that song about dr tarr and professor feather way back when was it alan parsons saw this on a brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected terrible full of streaks and stuff the movie was an incoherent mess goofy music and clueless characters the main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients i thought the doctor directing the battle scene was never going to end had some good looking babes though it seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked i gave it a 2 for the nekkid women that bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs poe probably did about 3 000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his
<START> indeed drug use warehouse shoot 'em ups 'matrix' esque bullet dodging a futuristic city with a mix of asian races and a lonely vampire all in the same movie seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese pop rock star and that is exactly what 'moon child' is and more while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b movie of the week 'moon child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way br br the film has a gritty definitely independent feel to it jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition but rather sporadic leaps and bounds giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot but the film makes no excuses instead turning the story into one of friendship love trust and betrayal all sugar coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society warring gangsters and vampires br br hyde as the somber vampire 'kei' is excellent giving depth to the character and balancing out the overly zealous acting of gackt as 'sho ' an orphan who befriends kei lee hom wang also shines as the vengeful 'son' who becomes friends with a grown up sho the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal br br while the action at times is all too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show off one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features the superstars as actors have their flaws and so do their characters the movie rarely gets boring and ends where it should after jumping about quite a bit 'moon child' is rather enjoyable humorous at times and even very touching it is definitely worth your time
<START> how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clichÃ©' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film what's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
<START> stories about the possibility of a post apocalyptic future have been around for ages since the very creation of science fiction as a genre per se the fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories whether they are good or bad br br terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film he gives the movie a decadent feel throughout showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy his world the world in which twelve monkeys transpires is a place where the mad run wild where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence where madness looms at every corner this is a very dark movie but his very best most linear despite the plot twists which hold up under examination and one which gets better with repeated viewings br br a tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of life on the planet as we have known it leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the earth by employing renegade citizens the scum of the earth as guinea pigs to go back in time among them one james cole underplayed to great effect by bruce willis cole could be any person we don't know anything about him but in a way that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission what we do know is that he is a man who dreams and his dreams may have been reality he may have already been at the scene of the event of 1996 br br it's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie when taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets jeffrey goines spastically played by brad pitt oscar nominated here who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction and later cole believes he has seen goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping what he doesn't know later he meets a psychologist kathryn railly madeleine stowe and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane and that she's seen him before this becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that something terrible is coming this way especially when she meets him six years later she has seen cole before at the same time cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle screaming for help after shots have rung out and a particular red headed man in a ponytail jeffrey goines has apparently escaped not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander the questions arise have these events happened are they going to happen who is really a part of this or better yet is everyone down to the smallest player a part of a greater plot or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again br br these questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo in which madeleine elster judy barton mourns her own brief existence you took no notice she says as cole and railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in snippets of dialog from vertigo form a foil to the dialog between railly and cole and later when cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for railly he comes face to face with her in disguise looking almost exactly like eva maria saint from north by northwest as the swelling bernard herrmann score plays the emergence of judy barton dressed as madeleine elster it's a fascinating sequence more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films madeleine stowe plays kathryn railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench coat and calls herself judy simmons while helping an insane man named james cole james stewart plays a detective who tries to help insane madeleine elster who will later re appear not once but twice first as brunette judy barton and later as madeleine action and re enaction play and re play
<START> so i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film br br the documentary section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a nut job from no where but that's not good enough to keep it interesting br br seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor br br when crispin glover takes on larry the story telling was better but i just couldn't take anymore
<START> as with all of angelopoulos' films the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are sparing with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts doubts or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicit br br the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a template where the reader's imagination and or past experience flourish angelopoulos' drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the non verbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so far br br the music by angelopoulos' long time collaborator eleni karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos' genius through arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film br br the suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although angelopoulos' political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees' plights in the process angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders br br angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus' travel alexander is a telemachus in search of a story about an aging greek politician odysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not alexander's father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figure odysseus as with homer's telemachus alexander grows as a person during his odyssey br br of course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer's odyssey in a contemporary context angelopoulos draws on odysseus's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film in angelopoulos' ending odysseus is more like the dante's odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase and alexander telemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voice over at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from dante's inferno and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away br br finally although angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow suited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the christ like figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography's influence in angelopoulos' work they appear like stylites religious figures found in the orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticism br br the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wife's statement it's not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary on this account angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble
<START> frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldn't be laughing you've already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide open mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the point br br but for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for him br br it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein's film but for some insane reason i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer if someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the pain perhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can't even begin to attempt to explain br br unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a doggie bag
