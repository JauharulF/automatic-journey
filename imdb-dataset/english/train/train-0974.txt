<START> i'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies i give a 1 to they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch maybe i should stop having faith in her taste in movies anyway this is typical drivel aimed at pre teen girls but done even more poorly than usual once again the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie he she made the main character unlikable she starts off by being a complete b tch to her friend at the beginning and then finds out when she becomes 30 that she's basically a sh tty person having affairs etc why the f would we feel for this person ok let's say we can get past that jennifer garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity i don't know if it's her or the writer's fault but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance here's a tip for future filmmakers 13 year olds are not entertaining they're annoying far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to thriller holy crap that was painful it showed her practicing that dance at the beginning that explains why she knows it but an entire club full of people argh the macarena would be more believable all of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices at least tom hanks' character on big had a job that made sense to a child these body switching child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet
<START> before the internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind it unfortunately thats all it was the generally opinion that nowadays the web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer the point just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence which is basically what spam is without the violence its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isn't a priority we see the internet get worse by the week the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing there actually is a site called horrorvision which is a porn site but this one kills the people who enter its portals the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service provider has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they won't be shut down when there's money to be made calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens
<START> man on fire is definitely one of the best drama crime thrillers i have ever seen despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well this is denzel washington's perfect role in which he plays a body guard called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protÃ©gÃ©e pita dakota fanning plays pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her as i said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times br br this film is made in two parts there's the first hour where everyone is happy nothing's wrong everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed and then there's the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and la hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita br br denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them it is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough washington really deserved another oscar for his performance and so did fanning and the director and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality br br if you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters 10 10
<START> just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywood like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends br br you will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided i didn't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner is he she trying to be racist br br a truly bizare movie only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened br br but on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent
<START> i was pretty surprised with this flick even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded br br i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella rÃ­os who is an excellent spanish talent something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting antonella rÃ­os truly is a star on the rise
<START> this film is probably pro muslimization br br why do i write that the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother he lives his first 20 years in a christian village in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head wear that he has kept his amulet and his general clothing he has a six year old child who wears the same head wear and therefore is probably a muslim although the mother is a christian the main character thus chooses to it seems to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim no one of the other male main characters which are christians seems to breed a child there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it it therefore seems
<START> this is definitely an appropriate update for the original except that party on the left is now party on the right like the original this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over zealous and over powerful federal government kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge where the us government with the cooperation of the mainstream media threw around words like white supremacist and right wing extremists as well as trumped up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights with the willing acquiescence of the general populace that message is so non pc i am stunned that this film could be made at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick katherine prudhomme the western journalism center and countless others who dared to speak out live free or die is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays the voice and that sums up the dangerous to some message of this film br br
<START> this film is brilliant it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories there are so many layers to this film it is innovative and absolutely fabulous
<START> the final season of roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy this final episode does just what a previous comment says it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not roseanne reaches back to season one and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit scott was not really with leon but he existed mark and david married opposite wives in real life and dan died when she made him live as events happened in her life she changed them in her writing don't we all wish we could do that don't we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking this is what she did with the entire episode and to another comment i would say that i don't feel cheated the family was real in my mind she just changed the way that events happened in their lives an a ending to an a show
<START> as seems to be the general gist of these comments the film has some stunning animation i watched it on blu ray but it really falls short of any real depth br br firstly the characters are all pretty dull i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito toola and the main antagonist shunack however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking laputa being my favourite animÃ© original engilsh dub the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected she loves agito who seems oblivious of this however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy br br there is also a serious lack of explanation like who are the druids really are they people and who are the weird women girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffids br br and who does call toola why bother with this if it wont be explained br br i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadn't bought it my advice give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap perhaps if your new to animÃ© films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it it certainly is visually pleasing
<START> where to start if this movie had been a dark comedy i would say it was fannn tastic unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare mind you that was the price i paid got it from wal mart this movie was meant to be a thriller the only thrill i got was watching kirkland's lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area if you want a good laugh on a rainy friday night with some friends then i highly recommend this movie but if you want to watch something at least half way decent then don't even bother br br i for one enjoy crappy films the worse the better in most cases but wow i meant wow the only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy played by vincent berry the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do
<START> don't even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i don't know why there's a minimum of 10 lines i've already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so you all take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too
<START> this is a great film for mccartney's and beatles fans a splendid time is guaranteed for all the audience feat some celebrities such as nicholson cuzak michael douglas is as always quite amazing from small children to old campaigners of the sixties they know the words to all the songs by heart and some of them are crying when paul breaks into blackbird yesterday all my loving and all the treasures of his catalog who except john lennon and dylan can claim such a repertoire there are two particularly moving moments br br the double tribute to lennon and harrison first here today performed solo the title was included in tug of war 1982 and was its best track then something when paul uses an ukulele br br the long and winding road rendition a key moment when paul's voice cracks as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage br br i remember in the early seventies when people used to despise paul cause he was not involved in politics as his ex partner was they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist fame is great cause it allows charity the film shows different aspects of paul's activities an artist who is anything but selfish
<START> this one is bad a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it a series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what's going on and isn't believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth not too much in this one vote 4 out of 10
<START> this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point br br the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it's the government's duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone br br spain never looked so backward
<START> one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable it's a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer
<START> this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union's first known serial killer i had tuned in just expecting a half decent tv movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told as others have said there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases br br much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved the acting by the whole cast is also superb especially that of the two leads stephen rea and donald sutherland their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after perestroika is genuinely touching br br if you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen i strongly recommend you look out for 'citizen x' br br
<START> the british public school system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception it was designed to produce administrators and governors civil servants and military men to run the british colonies these people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes when the public schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case they tended to favour the schools nearer town so eton and harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent the vast majority of public schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale tom brown perhaps the most famous public school pupil ever was the son of a country parson not a belted earl thus in late 1960s england a country in the throes of post colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his gannex mac lindsay anderson's if was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else it must be remembered that the so called summer of love was followed by the october revolution a non event that left a few policemen in london with bruised heads and the u s embassy with one or two broken windows but achieved absolutely nothing so when mr anderson's film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as mr malcolm mcdowell's glorious victory over an amorphous them despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the u s embassy the film told us nothing new about public schools homosexuality bullying cold showers patrician sarcastic teachers silly traditions an all too familiar list it was declared to be an allegory comparing britain to the corrupt crumbling society represented by the school well nearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishing the british social system has not changed the october revolution has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his state of the country trilogy to no effect whatsoever if by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale find a copy of stalky co written by the man whose much maligned poem if lent it's name to mr anderson's film a man born in colonial india a man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary history and do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non person perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that
<START> i came home late one night and turned on the tv to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week i didn't hear anything about red rock west except two thumbs up and see it before it went away it wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion but they said it deserved better br br the next afternoon i followed their advice they were right it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies as some readers point out there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end but it's well worth it for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour it's the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage but almost everybody seems perfectly cast dennis hopper goes almost over the top which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene br br when i rented it later for my family it didn't work as well the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate with the distractions at home it deserves your full attention turn off the phone make sure you won't be disturbed watch and listen to every scene especially in the beginning
<START> the shining starts with jack torrance jack nicholson driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart ullman barry nelson about becoming the winter caretaker ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in together with his wife wendy shelley duvall young son danny danny lloyd jack moves into the hotel at first everything seems fine it's a beautiful hotel absolutely huge whatever they need is at their disposal however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see hear things 'ordinary' people can't as the days weeks months begin to pass jack become more more insane danny keeps 'seeing' things people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it br br this english production was co written co produced directed by stanley kubrick is a fine horror film it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length the script by kubrick diane johnson is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film there are very few character's in the shining with jack wendy danny the only ones that really matter since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them become involved with them what they go through the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long keeps you interested throughout on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about there is very little in the way of violence or gore a couple of rotten zombie ghosts someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood special effects as it has a gripping story with a budget of about 19 000 000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free flowing smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors the sets look absolutely real instead of clichÃ©d old haunted house themes like dark corners basements cobwebs kubrick brings things right up to date with brightly lit corridors massive open expansive spaces a modern decor well 80's modern just check that red toilet out the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying nicholson seems crazy from the very start the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon for those looking for explosions fancy special effects you will be disappointed for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you well worth a watch in my humble opinion
