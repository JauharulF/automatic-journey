<START> i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford he is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird but still hot br br however despite how hot chace is it really did not make up for the film i guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache br br all in all although the plot was ok i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic that's why i only cut to scenes with chace in it lol anyways not worth renting unless your a die hard fan of a specific cast member like i was oh yeah the cast was hot the girls were hot but chace is the best
<START> by 1955 five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together four of them westerns their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and that's not counting ray teal or 'anthony' curtis later to become tony perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned one to add to the dvd collection
<START> this is 30 minute show about one joke the joke cavemen are not treated fairly hahaha he can't dial a phone because he is a caveman cavemen are not as smart as human beings oh jeez those cavemen are so unsophisticated there is no humor in this show they can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the geico commercials this show does not deserve a time slot on national t v br br this show tries to hard to be funny but it just isn't watching this show i was thinking that it was trying to be like a bachelor's gone wild show meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women the crying caveman is annoying the caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman hahaha all three of them have personalities but i can't figure out why i don't care about them
<START> firstly although many say it is the worst of the series i don't think that it is true considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do br br i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays aren't supposed to be for teenagers i mean cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out plus seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good time br br many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie well let's get real doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie what would you like to see smart books romantic stuff that is not at all what would be in those teenagers' minds br br to conclude i think that if you are a teenager you must absolutely see the movie and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager or things like that thanks for reading
<START> on the basis of the preview i'd seen i went to shower expecting a sweet little comedy what i found was a profoundly touching drama of family life told in some of the most lush photographic images i've ever been privileged to see in addition later reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to scenes from the past in the arid countryside of northern china and in the high plain of tibet isn't this how memory often works one moment i'm here the next i'm in a landscape from the past just like that br br i would not only strongly recommend this film i would place it among the two or three finest films i've seen in my 60 years br br by the way a couple of years ago another asian comedy was released in the united states as shall we dance japanese just as with shower the preview gave not the slightest indication of the depth of that film which turned out to be a subtle psychological study albeit chock full of funny moments is there a fear on the part of distributors of making films appear too important or deep to appeal to u s viewers
<START> to finally see what many consider to be the greatest women in prison film of all time i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds boy it sure contained the elements i expected and delivered so much more a constant i'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold tolerance and resolve not to mention sanity being tested by their superiors while most of them were hired for the way they look naked because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements something else emerges other attributes such as attitude and guts that i ultimately respond to br br this as you may know all too well was demme's debut for his mentor roger corman and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings for instance there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states there's a particular number featuring warden barbara steele where she reminded me of alex de large of a clockwork orange br br the film has female prisoners planning a daring escape tired of the crazed antics of their wheel chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc randolph warren miller juanita brown is maggie the tough sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out she's the one all the girls fear to cross erica gavin is jacqueline wilson the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with roberta collins is belle a serial kleptomaniac best pals with pandora ella reid belle becomes the obsession of randolph who promises superintendent mcqueen steele that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies drugging her up randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms cheryl rainbeaux smith is lavelle in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a senator lavelle receives work in randolph's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to pandora demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break out using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages with gunfire erupting br br i was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time demme collaborator cinematographer tak fujimoto as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison cells and rooms not an easy task the prison is appropriately crummy and the girls despite being quite attractive look the part of desperate inmates longing yearning from the very pits of their souls to escape such horrid entrapment steele is superb as the warden understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge cale's bluesy score is incredibly depressing while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun and games i think cale's score mirrors demme's handling of the material cale and demme's partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad isolating oppressive place while almost simultaneously showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast my favorite scene happens outside the prison as two of our girls joining forces with a third interrupt a bank robbery already in progress the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob as you might expect you get naked women in showers prisoner in solitary a cat fight shootouts attempted escapes which go awry and other exploitative elements such as a horrifying shock therapy session not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of belle interesting enough demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making

<START> i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni she spent some time out there researching although an ex pat she was very anti british she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film 'a long day's dying' it's the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
<START> allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but it's why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and it's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it br br this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good br br i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
<START> how the hell did they get this made presenting itself as a caper comedy the misbegotten is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments the usually dependable warren beatty looks drunk and the usually hilarious goldie hawn acts like she's on depressants as for gert frobe his most famous role goldfinger was infinitely more admirable than his character here not even the guy with the champagne bottle of lsd can save this litany of worthlessness br br am i comparing this movie to plan 9 from outer space i wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me p9fos was idiotically made but ended up hilarious this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears warren beatty and goldie hawn made up for this when they co starred in shampoo but then they co starred in the dreadful town country maybe they just shouldn't co star in movies all in all i would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again awful br br maybe they should remake it with jackie chan then i would pay to see it
<START> nahhh leila grace mills is a teenager turned on to satan and lsd by her archaeologist fiancÃ© richard there's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle where leila and richard drink blood drop drugs join in sex orgies dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all unfortunately these kind of extracurricular activities have left leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded spirit of evil leila also comes from a screwed up family which doesn't help either her older brother john is a recluse who seems to be in love with her her mother patricia maria perschy is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death to top it off her sister maria kosti is a slutty semi pro golfer named gasp debbie gibson there's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time two maids a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone plus udo luis induni a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on leila changing clothes takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit oh yeah and borg the pet german shepherd br br paul naschy is father adrian dunning the doubting priest zzzzz who starts snooping around after john and richard both have their heads twisted around backwards leila tells him they say i am perverse and i'm going to prove it is true during her birthday party she tells her guests you make me sick i hate you all and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches i don't want to see that fat ass debbie suggests they commit leila to a sanitory but leila runs off and joins the cult again she is rescued again and brought back home for the third time br br by this point in the movie there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f ed up their lives are and how leila is acting weird it's almost as agonizing to sit through as an andy milligan movie minus the gore and laughs but finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies an exorcist like possession flick unfortunately the best part of it are the contact lenses leila gets to wear some cheap time lapse slashes appear on her arms legs and face she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles she begins reeking of rotted flesh spits up some clear gunk starts speaking in her dead dad's voice sneaks into her mom's bedroom slaps her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore in comes father adrian who now finally believes she is indeed possessed fends off her attempts at seduction hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses leila with holy water doors open and close a mirror breaks there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor after she tackles dunning and the two roll down the stairs the spirit is out of her and into guess who why borg the family pooch the demon dog then turns on adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film it's leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self but then there's another time lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body it's so badly done you really have no clue what to make of it which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless pos br br screw the contacts 1 out of 10 it is
<START> it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka tramps like us in the u s but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga it's a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her outward strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet human momo if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j dorama japanese drama actors resses then this is definitely the series to watch and read
<START> formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way comedus reliefus no to help deceive girl etc this one's been done to death and with rare exception of a few z rated outings it's been done better br br stale plot aside the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair
<START> there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since given the very low average rating given to the film by other people i think you may draw your own conclusions br br this is a very bad film i'll admit it i thought the concept was kind of cute and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known br br acting the leads seemed competent enough but everyone else terrible br br plot chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through br br direction non existent br br humour did they really think people were going to laugh oh boy br br eye candy ok there were some really beautiful women in this film not just the three main female characters but right across the board it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was if so they failed miserably br br in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic it wasn't even close
<START> i really liked this movie i've read a few of the other comments and although i pity those who did not understand it i do agree with some of the criticisms which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch i also love the movies such as this one which provoke so many debates theories possible endings and hidden subtext congratulations mr crowe definitely in my top ten br br p s saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip where does the dream end and the real begin
<START> a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm the police have closed the bridge saying it's unsafe and they are stuck in a little cafÃ© until the road has been cleared however after a while their boredom is turned to concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low brow way br br this is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone instead of the typical twists or social commentary this one features no lasting message however it's also very and watchable so who cares exactly what occurs you'll just have to see for yourself br br by the way this one stars john hoyt a face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies in almost every case he played a real grouch like charles lane during the same era but boy did i love seeing him as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time
<START> this is a good example of how not to make a film br br there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary br br this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors br br the climax is anti climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it br br the director's commentary was a one shot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isn't necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie br br the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse
<START> eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell a man who devotes his time to finding lost children when the beautiful kee nang charlotte lewis enters his life she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey one that involves peril and worst of all the demon sardo numspa br br is the golden child a product of its time by that i mean was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade it's box office was 79 817 937 making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking quipping and charming best seriously br br cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981 the golden child hits all the required genre buttons pretty girl daring reluctant hero with a quip in his armoury dashing villain charles dance so english i could kiss him myself wonderful colour and a cute kid with mystical powers the film only asks you to get involved in the fun not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture yes the cgi demon looks creaky now and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s 90s and beyond but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious seriously 7 10
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen this movie has nothing positive about it some of you people actually like this movie i've seen a lot of dracula movies and i've liked everyone that i've seen but when i saw this movie i said to myself what the hell is this what a stupid movie now they have dracula becoming who he is because he is judas for those of you who don't know who judas is he betrayed jesus christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself you have to be kidding me that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard for why dracula became evil who asked for a reason anyway what a piece of sh this movie is who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten even the dracula is horrible if you ever saw this movie you wouldn't even think it was dracula wow dracula 2000 is that title supposed to impress me don't waste your time or your money on this trash
<START> i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved unfortunately my hopes were dashed yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing at one point there is a laughable scene where 4 kgb agents couldn't handle one cia agent i grow weary of these biased one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww2 and beyond just like the pathetic u 571 where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine again utterly false br br to its credit the company is very well filmed and acted the locales are also exceptionally well realised alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton the conflict between them is very well done i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other 2 episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10 10 br br s
