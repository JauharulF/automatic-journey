<START> war drama that takes place in louisiana in 1971 it follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then tigerland an accurate portrayal of vietnam on american soil before they're shipped over it focuses on two men booz colin farrell and paxton matthew davis how they meet become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader clifton collins jr and a borderline psycho shea wingham br br a surprisingly non commercial film directed by joel schumacher he uses a hand held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes it works very well the film looks gritty as it should and uncomfortably realistic br br farrell successfully covers up his irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent his performance is just superb he's an extremely talented young man davis unfortunately is not that good he's tall muscular very handsome and very bland the rest of the cast however is just great br br this film was thrown away by its studio it had no stars in it a familar story and was considered just another war film it only played a week in boston it's well worth catching on video or dvd br br also farrell and davis have a lengthy nude scene
<START> as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own it's a neurological drama it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person's brain br br it's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf br br no small feat for such a sort of a movie br br the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage
<START> veteran director and producer allan dwan whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown for example john wayne in sands of iwo jima tried his hand at a big musical with i dream of jeanie harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and as it turned out virtually no future he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great american songwriter stephen foster br br bill shirley is the young lovestruck foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy his intended is inez mcdowell muriel lawrence whose pesky younger sister jeanie eileen christy is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly impecunious song smith foster is in love with inez who is revolted by the composer's number 1 on the levee hit parade tune o susannah enter minstrel edwin p christy ray middleton to help launch the profit making phase of foster's career br br this is by the musical film standards of the early fifties a big production the sets are lavish in that special hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings the singers aren't half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to ruin br br but this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum south the biggest number features black face for all on stage an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution br br i dream of jeanie apparently sank into the studio's vault with barely a death whisper now revived by alpha video for a mere 4 99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of america's great crime slavery br br this was what hollywood was putting out two years before brown v board of education must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater
<START> i watched the dvd called black widow in the u s a and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity not even a breast but i've read several other comments on imdb com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite sophomoric plot giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gills and nary an expression touches her face and her name makes me think of super sizing a beverage at taco bell i'll have the cola grande it was actually kind of fun it was so bad i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater 3000 noting things like the fact that dafoe's skin is too big for his face it's really like silly putty
<START> rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative but who knew he was such a red blooded reactionary if you can put aside rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy and that is not an easy thing to do given that for instance the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts this is actually an elegant intelligent and polished movie lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards it is a blatantly artificial conceit but it somehow works and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be
<START> this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon like absurdity br br here the 40 something stay at home ex wife of a successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect gardener who's black but then horror of middle aged women's horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts 'taking over her life br br what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really belonged to the divorcee she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane so why did she rent the room and to horror of horrors a much younger woman br br supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking of course 20 something but there's this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings it just isn't generally used in quite this sort of way br br the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe is me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for the house then begins woopie br br the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime br br the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn't after the successful lawyer ex husband though she does con his help to the ex wife's fury in her quest she's after the house technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn't matter he still strayed br br the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal i couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it br br spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick br br well here's a clue the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house there she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there's a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found she then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment how sweet
<START> from what critics and audiences indicated birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isn't your basic american comedy and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but that's why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k 19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
<START> fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days br br as has already been pointed out this is hardly a real zombie film but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented feel good 50s style i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido his fellow sufferers br br while the cast is generally good i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not in your face but rather subdued there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema but it doesn't strive to be instead currie succeeds in delivering a heart warming black comedy
<START> fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart orcas are but in the meanwhile and quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film richard harris plays quint i'm sorry that's wrong he plays captain nolan a fisherman who catches sharks for a living but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry don't ask it's mate don't ask goes on a rampage don't ask and starts stalking captain nolan don't ask soon captain nolan realizes that they have something in common don't ask pretty amazing film making here folks i got to tell you though the beginning with the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits with the most godawful song is pretty entertaining
<START> pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy br br this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british stalwarts especially stanley holloway makes this more believable br br there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them br br even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feeling br br it's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
<START> previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm but it was a severe disappointment lupe valdez is great but doesn't get enough screen time frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them stranded br br the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy's character who is at best a self centered physically and verbally abusive jerk the reactions of the public are poorly thought out and unbelievable making the shenanigans seem like contrivances of a bad writer and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him br br the stinging one liners mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made
<START> this is a very well made film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero it's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters br br a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly one sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out
<START> the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero bruce lee sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting the way he slips into bruce's style and then back to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all comedy some unintentional like the fake black guy action and some incredible fight scenes br br a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time
<START> first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my grandmothers br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 she even outlived walter matthau's magnificent impersonation of her would deny it but some of you must find resonance in these characters br br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure lingers
<START> this film is really bad so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it a poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again this garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material
<START> the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn it's peak years were between 1968 and 1972 one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique br br gary graver the director was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica gayle's screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast forward button
<START> the film transported everyone back to october 20 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great philippine 'i shall return' landing sceneÂ it was on that leyte shore where general macarthur reaped his fameÂ br br above all gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great generalÂ it is the stride the set of the shoulders the intensityÂ it's what both men have had in common intensity total absorption devotionÂ with macarthur it was for the militaryÂ with peck it was for the challenge of actingÂ an academy award winner for to kill a mockinbird an oscar nominee for keys to the kingdom the yearling gentleman's agreement and twelve o'clock high Âhe has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney from biblical david to captain horatio hornblowerÂ he has brought to them all his own unique insight his character his sincerity warmth and love and especially his humorÂ br br there is a scene where 'macarthur' stands on deck with the 'president of the philippines ' we can hear the dialogue general i hope the water isn't too deep says the 'president ' because my people will find out i can't swim then come peck's sonorous voice and my people are going to find that i can't walk on water br br as macarthur peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industryÂ through him we felt macarthur's emotions we knew his anger his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole familyÂ
<START> if there is a hell it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors danny glover alfre woodard kevin kline mary louise parker would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity but no apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell the entire affair is pretentious overblown insulting if you are deaf or know anyone who is be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene grand canyon is filled with obnoxious self involved people but never gives us a reason to like understand sympathize with or even tolerate them with rare exception they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without there's no plot to speak of no character development these people won't ever develop no break out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film the best thing about grand canyon its title this is one large hole of a movie
<START> well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004 panaghoy sa suba call of the river placed second in the recent metro manila film festival as expected it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies br br it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio she did a great job portraying bikay the younger sister of duroy i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her br br some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different br br in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film
<START> magnificent and unforgettable stunningly atmospheric and brilliantly acted by all br br i really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 and nine ones br br this along with grapes of wrath is john ford's greatest movie i would say that long voyage home is next in line though quite a way back br br rating 10 it deserves a 12
