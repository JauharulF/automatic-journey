<START> this is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness there is genuine skill in manufacture of this work it manages to be intrigiung funny and frightening at various times work with it for the first few minutes and you won't be disappointed
<START> when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television we've all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the 25th century and silver spoons is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile br br thankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg 1 is not good the 12 year old me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever you're in trouble br br the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool sci fi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like he's half asleep most episodes br br the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement the cinematography isn't much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style like farscape and substance like the reimagined battlestar galactica have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just doesn't deserve it
<START> this film is so bad it made me want to vomit poorly produced a complete laugh free zone why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof and a damn funny one at that as it stands the sets are laughable the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable and the acting farcical it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage national lampoon once made animal house which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious now they've been relegated to making tv movies like this lump of name your expletive and it could be accurately used to describe this film
<START> i gave this a four purely out of its historical context it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early nineties br br moe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo spade cooley has a couple of numbers i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch i'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy even the stooge's seem to be going through the motions overall there's nothing much really to recommend here br br if you're not a stooge fan then don't bother if you are a stooge fan then stick with the shorts
<START> i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell played by p j soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuff br br it was fun energetic quirky and cool yes i'll admit that the ending is way way over the top and far fetched but it doesn't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie it's sex pot and rock n rocll forever br br i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not
<START> eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever probably the funniest delirious is the best stand up comedy i've ever seen and it is a must have for anyone who loves a good laugh i've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it i still have side splitting fun this is definitely one for your video library i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much that you will miss half of them delirious is hilarious br br although there are a lot of funny comedians out there after watching this stand up comedy most of them will seem like second class citizens if you have never seen it get it watch it and you will love it it will make you holler
<START> this film is really unbelievable i've seen so much cheap trash movies especially a lot 'full moon' pictures but 'dollman' is really hard so much comes together the laughable story the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects how long i could talk about them it is a really bad movie but also one of the funniest ones if you're a fan of bad movies to laugh about you have to see it and don't miss 'dollman vs demonic toys' it really funnier and worse
<START> i've been a fan since his first album this film is a disservice to him the performances except for one by rufus wainwright and teddy thompson are simply terrible br br those by martha wainwright nick cave antony and jarvis cocker were particularly annoying even the one by the mcgarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of martha wainwright br br i've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and i found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work br br there are many who have been able to interpret mr cohen's songs jennifer warnes kd lang billy joel aaron neville and willie nelson come to mind but those people selected for this performance were just awful br br hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing leonard cohen on film that will illustrate his insight talent and intelligence br br so sad
<START> set in world depression era prague this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee stewart is having an affair with the owner's wife leaving stewart briefly 'fired' along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' stewart all along the happy ending is inevitable br br although very dated references to poverty and i have a wife and two kids to consider are over used along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure like a musical cigar box are out of reach for common people's enjoyment this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make you've got mail in the re make starring tom hanks and meg ryan the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended br br shop around the corner is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated less hectic and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's utopia lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture
<START> ed harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable sean connery the movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict it is breathtaking a master class in artistic control br br the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable as is fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers this is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end br br still worth watching to see harris in action
<START> i had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it the plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick the music hip hop freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in breakin' but i have to say that breakin' 1 2 carry the energy excitement to the screen a lot better it's a movie i will keep in my library but it's not a movie that i can watch over over again just once in a blue moon
<START> i saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much this picture was the worst half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film i couldnt blame them if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear
<START> fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip hop culture it is just as funny as this is spinal tap if not funnier the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films this film is a true cult classic
<START> bruce almighty' will sweep the academy awards with a record 14 oscar wins it will surpass titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time jim carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 white house playoffs almighty then these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers carrey included would possess the powers of god that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey's new laugh riot bruce almighty' carrey plays bruce nolan a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps god heavenly played by morgan freeman grants bruce the gift of god' his powers in order to challenge him if he can do god's job any better obviously bruce gets carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in bruce almighty' jennifer aniston was not mis pittiful' as bruce's girlfriend however my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for 2 and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time bruce almighty' is not the most in depth carrey film but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of carreyism' good
<START> this has to be the worst and i mean worst biker movie ever made and that's saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly br br now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from gilligan's island a frightened looking tina louise she was probably afraid someone would see this mess is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history but don't worry fans batman i mean adam west as a hick town doctor comes to the rescue pow crush boom holy toledo batman br br the only good points of this bomb are some cute women some laughable fight scenes and the still sexy tina louise
<START> my mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of 1976 i loved it then and i love it now i know everyone makes fun of barbra's hair in this one but i think she looks and sounds great and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time also the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy the music is great as well this is the groovy 70's babs at her best
<START> my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send them br br of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually it's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show br br this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
<START> strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat uninspiring drivel if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance were instead awkward and painful to watch obviously revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness
<START> i have to admit that i went into fever pitch with low expectations it's no huge revelation for me to say that jimmy fallon's last movie taxi was catwomanly bad and the trailers for fever pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me i was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review br br i like jimmy fallon but taxi was strike one in his movie career well now we've got steeeeee riiiiiike twoooooooo one more strike and it's back to snl or buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks but don't buy tickets to fever pitch you'll walk out of the theater and never go back then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than i was expecting but hey i couldn't let my puns go to waste right another reason i thought i wouldn't care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox my whole family hates 'em the mere mention of pedro martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom oh man hold on br br all right i'm back anyway my mom who is a st louis cardinals fan still believes the world series was rigged last year she refuses to believe the sox won it legitimately but i'm man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize albeit only slightly with the plight of red sox fans br br anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as fallon's ben can go through there's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate well figuratively speaking it's the joy of being a sports fan wait 'til next year becomes your mantra your motto your prayer and fever pitch effectively captures that essence br br i love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real life backdrop of the red sox' improbable world series run last year i don't love it so much that i want to marry it but you know what i mean i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner and while some of the humor is a little silly it's actually pretty realistic br br you see ben's uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old and when he died he left ben his two season tickets ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him he makes everybody dance for the yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the royals sorry mr shade and the devil rays it's a very good scene and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the ticket draft day i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents the red sox are playing a road game but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it one of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result been there it's a very tense and scary situation weeeeeell ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome lindsey is embarrassed and her parents don't know what to think yeah sports fans can be weird i don't deny it but it's real br br now if you're expecting the crude edgy stuff that the farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed they do have their moments though like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth like an adorable stroke victim but overall this is definitely a softer more romantic side that the bros are putting on display br br that's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy thankfully when the sap starts to ooze a bit the farrellys know when to pull away a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying you've gotta tell me about the outfield is it spongy jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm fever pitch is just good solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre it's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em br br now if the red sox fans could please shut up about the curse of the bambino i would appreciate it my memphis tigers have never won the ncaa basketball championship so i officially declare my plight greater than yours br br the gist fans of jimmy fallon drew barrymore romantic comedy the red sox baseball or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look i wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time but it'll make a great matinÃ©e br br rating 3 25 out of 5
<START> here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time 'the tenant' is quite an interesting work by polanski one of the first of his european exile it is set in paris and as in so many other exile films the city its streets the seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not to be an american as in 'frantic' for example but a pole as himself was when going west there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director's life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of exorcism br br it's in a way a circular story the hero named trelkovsky rents an apartment in old parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella a spectacled isabelle adjani in her first role after truffaut's 'l'histoire d'adele h ' soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are it's a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her the circle is closed br br it's not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion to a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical 'knife in the water' made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of polanski there are many details that are never explained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes the feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the english spoken dialogs the film was made in english almost neutralize the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience br br it's not the best film that polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career
