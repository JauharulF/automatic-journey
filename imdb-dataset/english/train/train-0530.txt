<START> madhur bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society one gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like satta and chandni bar the issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in totality here the casting is amazing and one can see the judgements on each scene from many angles mostly the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around as you start guessing the things you end up at most being close but missing the mark in many a scenes it leaves a lasting impression in the end br br actors to watch are konkana sen sharma boman irani atul kulkarni among others the dialogues are well written and you feel you've lived around some of these people there are still some scenes that make you think of more depths the songs are in the background saving time and lata's voice in a very meaningful song kitne ajeeb leaves you feeling you're left all alone in the midst of the modern society
<START> the young lady's name is bonnie polay she's attractive is apparently living a pretty decent life but all of a sudden is inexplicably snatched from her home and life by evil dude and the various and sundry evil henchmen now she has no idea what the hell is going on only that a bunch of armed to the teeth people apparently want her dead and she's going to die not even knowing why br br god i hear the whining all the time now that content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies books comics internal organs there's going to be nobody to ensure that there's a standard of quality we're going to be drowning in crap the only people who actually think this are people who haven't watched any movies or read any books recently because we're already doing a dead man's float in crap it's folks like ferrari and rodriguez who put the lie to these ignorant so and sos by throwing 8k on the table and making well what i would say is a better action flick than anything you've seen in cinemas this year but you haven't seen any action flicks in the cinema this year i've seen the box office you're staying away in droves you would do better to snag a copy of this spend twenty minutes being entertained and get on with your lives br br it's sheer entertainment you enter like bonnie with a lot of questions and where the whole thing ends up is nebulous the whole conceit has been done before in multiple ways but not in such a compressed amount of time and not without such concentrated tasty gunplay you're there for the atmosphere the mystery and the guns that's it that's all the filmmakers promise and they deliver br br it warms the black pits of my heart to think this was made on such a budget we get passed a goodly number of indie films around here but seldom do we see anything as polished as this short is and we've never seen one done in the action genre that looked this good hell you could hand these two guys mi 3 and it might draw me into watch it the bond franchise hell anything no in fact better yet i'd like to see these guys make a feature on their own and stay the hell away from hollywood whatever's out there killing the movie industry is no doubt infectious br br best indie we've seen in a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen the dvd's 20 and has bonus features out the ass go take your movie ticket budget and put it towards this instead
<START> well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation br br there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the money br br lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter br br if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox diana rigg
<START> notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey it's often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you can't back the legend up with substance br br the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama br br once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast' encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fast forward thru the banality but it's not really worth the effort the nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertolucci's the dreamers br br try as one might to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the carnality i doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted and this beast has been tamed
<START> kurosawa really blew it on this one every genius is allowed a failure the concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred br br there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal many of them have interesting stories to tell a very disappointing film
<START> one word supurrrrb i don't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re runs br br i have to say i had my reservations after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercial free show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellence br br graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed br br cast was marvelous i am partial to john goodman's voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa kudrow's guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her panda from brooklyn only in this show br br script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and there's a reason why it's set for 9pm not 8pm so if you'd like to complain about objectionable context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it br br not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy's characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but that's yesterday's news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have that's fine by me but please don't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over br br in general the show is definitely a must see tv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there there haven't been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode
<START> 1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time terminator 2 judgment day and bill ted's bogus journey out of the two i've always liked bill ted's bogus journey a bit better terminator 2 judgment day is the better made but there's just nothing like bill and ted besides chris farley and david spade in tommy boy it's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than bill and ted they are one of a kind br br seemingly influenced by national lampoon's o c and stiggs bill and ted were created by ed solomon and chris matheson two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in l a back in the 1980s the two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long bill ted's excellent adventure was born the film shot in 1987 and released in 1989 became a big box office success and an instant cult classic it wasn't long before work began on the sequel stephen herek the director of 'excellent adventure' wasn't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean spirited and unlike the first one so peter hewitt making his feature film debut was brought in to direct the sequel there couldn't have been a better director for the job bill ted's bogus journey is marvelously directed it's filled with its own unique style and energy that can't be matched br br what makes 'bogus journey' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original it is just as fun it doesn't change the characters like most sequels do bill and ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film this is because it was written by the original writers most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one but since 'bogus journey' had the same screenwriters it ended up being just as good as 'excellent adventure' if not even better just like the first one 'bogus journey' is absolutely hilarious well written fun and above all original it's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from alex winter keanu reeves and william sadler it's an unforgettable 'journey' 10 10
<START> if you can make it thru classic meyer titles intro you can wade thru anything but would you want to i did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into i suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted a la charlie's angels but for my money i'd like a little something more more visual more moving more i feel like i'm begging for gruel the foot of the master the mans got the goods but he just won't share
<START> critics need to review what they class as a quality movie i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions br br i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film a film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not br br 10 10 don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors
<START> h g wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural biology on one side and marxism market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race first of all the non caucasian with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages then within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy the alcoholics the mentally disabled all those who were genetically disabled etc that was not hitler that was h g wells and that was not after the first world war that was more than ten years before and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth would see the differentiation of the human race into two species the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election no parliament no really democratic institution only peace imposed by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors and in that future world all absolutely all human beings are caucasians wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036 amazing wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets frightening and that was produced in 1936 all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism fascism japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h g wells we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute democratic social selection or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days it would be unfair to go beyond this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> when i saw this film in the 1950s i wanted to be a scientist too there was something magical and useful in science i took a girl friend along to see it a second time i don't think she was as impressed as i was this film was comical yet serious at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today
<START> just too many incidents of violence br br the film goes from one scene to another and in nearly every one violence erupts br br now i am not one who is shocked by violence and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing but please not one after another my reaction was not shock or horror it was here we go again there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely and couldn't wait for the end br br if this is the best the film makers can do they should find something else to do with their miserable lives like making shoes or delivering mail
<START> i watched this let me rephrase suffered through this because i'm a fan of eva's i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos i like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars and that money was probably spent on the caterer br br the premise was interesting but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not br br i won't bother saying who did what and how because it isn't worth the effort i'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this garbage br br oh before you flame on me i love movies i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know
<START> okay so there aren't really that many great movies around recent gems like american dream the straight story and even toy story 2 don't normally come so close together but boy does this film counter balance the quality br br i have no idea what these people thought they were doing are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of i can just see it now br br producer so we've got joe fiennes he's cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love and we've got rhys ifans who isn't cute but was cool in notting hill we'll mix in a really mediocre score a few forgettable post britpop tunes hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you've got the worst film of the new millennium and believe me it's gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years br br the bank i like it any unnecessary sex bad camera movements and what about the worst accents this side of devil's own br br producer yeah we got plenty of those br br the bank sounds great where do we sign br br please
<START> robert a heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoeven's film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinlein's death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6 part animated series is plot wise the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic br br the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the book's plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but it's far superior to the film heinlein's political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version br br overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look
<START> wow i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s however then i find out that this film was made in 1989 say what well the nostalgia factor ends right there this is just bad the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools which is odd in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant in fact the main character lives in a mansion makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive have they never heard of property taxes oh but here is the kicker the school board says that they will keep the school alive if the students can raise 200 000 so the seniors go about doing this hmmm you raise 200 000 but instead of saving that for college you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out and ahh forget it this film was stupid and made in 1989
<START> i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series it was so boring that i couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over it even tires me to write a review on it br br okay 4 was a joke and freddy was the joker 5 tried to return to the roots of the series it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4 which is a good thing basically they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares because of that nightmare 5 the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox br br the plot freddy killing lisa's friends by using the dreams of lisa's unborn child has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there isn't any and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that i don't like cheese though even if i am from switzerland not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 br br don't bother to rent buy this film if not for completeness it's quite a mess br br my rating 4 10 get used to it 6 is also a messy one
<START> i cant understand at all why so many godzilla fans think this is excellent one of the best godzilla films ever in fact this film is horrible and one of the very few gojira films i cant stand to watch again the other being g vs megalon br br the plot is too campy to be in the heisei series a series that attempted to turn the aging godzilla franchise into bonafide action films revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991 it just sounded ridiculous especially with some of the subject matter take for example the ww2 scene with the japanese soldiers praising a dying godzillasaurus a mournful and serious tone take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death serious seens in a film its fans somehow denote as played for laughs as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films i've seen however i think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad it was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare from the jet packs to the android to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything its impossible to take anything seriously and yet the film expects you to there's no nudges to the camera br br like nearly all godzilla films there's a pointless romance and this is no exception though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable there is literally no reason at all presented for the romance it just happens and there lives make 360 degree commitments for it aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue both the japanese and english is horrible clunky and possibly the inspiration for battlefield earth br br the tristar dvd compounds the problems making everything look grainy blurred dim and just plain ugly the same was for the sound i first saw the japanese region 2 version and the differences are night and day with the original vibrant colors and texture the noteworthy score the fight scenes especially are actually watchable br br in my opinion the heisei series is a disappointment with the exception of godzilla 1984 japanese version there is little to praise here and godzilla vs king ghidorah is case in point of this failure it doesn't even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets br br 2 out of 10
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice
<START> i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network there's just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on yes you're right about the sub par acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel
