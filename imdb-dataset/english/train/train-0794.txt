<START> a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store and picking stuff just because i haven't seen it a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen br br long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones he made this better than average drama watching it you begin to notice how many decent good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large preferably large and unsubtle and scandalous kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director um no thanks br br his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot the plague is coming but here's an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope here's an almost watchable barabra bel geddes with her bathos turned way down well for her they're a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment these are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life something hollywood in its greed now studiously avoids these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them it's a personable human scaled film not the grotesque overscaled production that he and others david lean will later popularize whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge br br i just watched it twice and i'll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain and naked city which you should really get your hands on
<START> never see this movie br br it tries to be a spoof on scifi thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it br br it is very lame a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it this movie does not have any such aspect br br save yourself it's too late for me but just don't watch it
<START> with oliver hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns bells phones and trombones his doctor finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk partner stan laurel comes up with a great solution living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help ollie get all the rest he needs it's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat and an escaped convict richard cramer stows along for the ride br br i got a kick out of all the gags in the film starting with that sign in the horn testing factory 'silence while men are working' the early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps with stan doing a banana within a banana bit laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture like we must have been dis unconnected but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship self preservation is the last law of averages precisely br br i'm not as great a student of laurel and hardy's films as many on this board all i know is i enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth on that count saps at sea provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun well on it's way to hornomania
<START> this movie is about as underrated as police acadmey mission to moscow this movie is never funny it's maybe the worst comedy spoof ever made very boring and dumb beyond belief for those people that think this movie is underrated god help you i give this movie out of br br
<START> i've watched this documentary twice and although i'm an major movie buff most documentaries don't hold my attention this film however was mesmerizing almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary which this documentary does not have br br the concept of this film is amazing i can't praise it enough mardi gras beads who would have thought br br amazing and excellent choices of interviews film footage of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually there br br i'm political aware and i've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me however it's made me think so much br br i wish so much too that this world was a better place br br a million kudos to the filmmaker and thanks for making this film too br br i wish everyone could see it
<START> this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy accept for it being an australian film with people who can't act br br once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon now a number of years later the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video it is cliche ridden and a waste of time and money see it only out of curiosity or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to not be able to act lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours but ended up in the x files how did that happen
<START> is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement to a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus even though such people normally outsource their brain to hollywood for these important issues the teachings of hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing fortunately ed is here to teach neo hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism br br here you'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk you'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear you'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary armageddon br br in addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are you'll be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were amish br br in the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods holy be thy names and audit i e judge their lifestyles note this is the only time it's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco toys so that they can wag their finger in other people's faces br br what does ed have in store for us in season three maybe he'll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping
<START> i wasted my time and gave this show a chance this has to be one of the worst new shows if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should sweep the category the acting is poor and the story line is contrived now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining that show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped this new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the caveman characters
<START> this would have been what you got br br words alone cannot describe how bad this is if you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes br br robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s but he's phoning it in here in an interview johnny duncan robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape br br driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al's used car lot at below sticker price the dynamic duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's bruce wayne's car they're driving in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial br br the acting is wooden the sets are cheap the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i'm sure it read along the lines of batman says something here because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along br br batman's utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts never to be seen again his cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike br br in one scene i am not making this up batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods it's radioactive so he can trace it the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained well unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse we know it's a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out and soon the whole place burns to the ground thanks batman br br in another scene after the batmobile is disabled batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one yes you guessed it said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city br br there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce's house or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood br br everything about this serial is bad and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen if you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark if you want entertainment try the burton batman films the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial
<START> i think it great example of the differences between two cultures it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that lets band together and get the job done plot device it seems most people don't realize that this movie is not just a comedy it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely overall i give it a solid 8
<START> ok aside from the psychedelic background imagery the info presented here was good the music i could have done without not that it was bad music just that it didn't fit this film at all br br as for the content of the film the director brings up the often lacking pagan perspective on christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christ's life vs the lives of mythological figures deities such as mithra and dionyses then he brings up the chronology of christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case but not one that blew me away br br if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them this film would have been good however at this point in the film it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on mel gibson's passion of the christ and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth during an interview with his old principal which during the course of it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses i felt that the director was acting sort of childish he was asking good questions but like the film itself the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules not christianity br br all in all if you're just interested in some info watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off
<START> it's common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone there's a difference however between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members in the secret lives of dentists starring campbell scott and hope davis director alan rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life br br scott gives a fine performance in the role of david hurst a dentist married to another dentist davis rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly he is completely absorbed in the day to day duties of being the parenthood she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life and then ratchets up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man from this point on the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good from time to time david is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by denis leary borrowing heavily from brad pitt's tyler durden in fight club br br while there is enough uncertainty about dana's infidelity and david's instability to warrant examination the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative instead rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the hurst family culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film's climax the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn't so dedicated to his family neither does it spend much time looking at dana's precarious balancing act between her family life and her other more fulfilling ambitions br br by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry rudolph kills the momentum of his film by the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly the film has used up all the good graces of scott's well measured performance david and dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale with nothing to build on over the last hour the conclusion seems awkward and patched on the secret lives of dentists takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it altogether a disappointing unimaginative film
<START> a documentary without a loss for words ever br br let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof let us assume it is a commentary on japanese society and as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come the constant wordplay as fast is it goes and as poorly translated as it is in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the copenhagen cinematek it is still quite enjoyable br br but for the patient and only the truly patient and open minded i'm talking to you jim jarmusch fans with add relapses i believe this is a film for you it's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over br br quite beautiful and quite kitsch and quite japanese sub culture and quite experimental static 2d in a 3d world all in all fun for those that want to see a japanese film that spoofs japanese food culture a thumbs up if you're in the mood for something completely different
<START> my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what it was but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of i know that this was a very cheesy movie but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work br br jenny johnson scary that's my best friend's actual name is not your typical average librarian looking woman when matt your average male asks her out he's in for more than he expected he's asked g girl out on a date the super hero of the world but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl hannah and she will make his life a living hell i mean let's face it he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with br br the effect were corny but you seriously move past them quickly the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie it was such a step up from prime my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it anyone could br br 7 10
<START> uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama at least once we've left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest Â although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character Â and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance Â are dispensed with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay's sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad libs the directorial style of writer director krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti's soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoor's film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i'd noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which i'd seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family Â here living in the austerity of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china's tang dynasty Â whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext
<START> hello can anybody hear me i don't know why you came to this page but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie join the fanclub this movie was so unbelievably bad i couldn't stop laughing when i saw it i think it's a must see it's bad in a nice way every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here i'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made
<START> i just finished watching this film and wow was that bad actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so monumentally bad it was kind of entertaining the action of the characters is hilarious from the hyper dramatic way they fall to gunfire to their incredibly bad acting were the bad guys all just pulled off the street or were they actually actors to incredibly bad delivery of lines to their inexplicable actions if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines br br the camera work was also really bad you can hardly see what's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness br br i would have voted 1 except that i do like chiba and sidekick sue shihomi and i was entertained by a couple of scenes 1 breaking of a villain's arm so the bone pops out of the skin that's gotta hurt 2 a drug kingpin eating a brown furred animal a monkey by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3 sonny chiba's performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers br br i am actually a big fan of sonny chiba but this one is really not worth anyone's time i've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching and they are great are the street fighter series and the killing machine i've also heard the executioner and golgo 13 are good i recommend sticking to those ones
<START> this short was nominated for an academy award and i wish it had won basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians including lester young and joe jones the music is incredible hollywood quite often embraced jazz particularly animation believe it or not but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam this has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly so tcm runs this as filler periodically and runs it every march sometime for its' 31 days of oscar tribute from downtown at the buzzer swish nothing but net and the shot's so smooth the net barely moved most solidly and highly recommended
<START> good movie very 70s you can not expect much from a film like this sirpa lane is an actress of erotic films a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears but the '70s were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today the world has changed incredibly the plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary and the brunette actress has a single body has one breast slightly bigger be satisfied papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them
<START> this is a horrible little film and unfortunately the company that made this short made several others the short is essentially a one joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children most appeared about 2 years old cavorting about and pretending to be adults in this case a dancehall girl and bar room patrons it's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults but i can't see anyone wanting to see this especially when a very young shirley temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp and then other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations at the time i am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles but when looking at it today that is what immediately comes to mind because of this this boring film also creeped me out and i hope to never see it again pretty strange and pretty awful
