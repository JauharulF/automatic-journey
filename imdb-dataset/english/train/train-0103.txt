<START> this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it's ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption where was the character development the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in dahmer's development also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh etc i could go on but to sum up too many lagging points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is dahmer
<START> will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts writer grant nieporte and italian director gabriele muccino come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching feeling this film i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character irs agent ben thomas he played in this film you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger the frustrations over his love for emily played by rosario dawson who by the way was fantastic as usual i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love woody harrelson also stars in this top notch film i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points all i can say is watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you take the phone off the hook sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas i thank you will smith for another great film
<START> the shame of it there i was comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment what did i get disappointed how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this the humour was dreadful the songs were worse than country and western and that's saying something and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island a short tale such as christmas carol is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun where do the muppets go next how about muppets wizard of oz
<START> noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an under appreciated gem as i regard many films from the 30's this is no gem not even semi precious the anachronistic clothing and 1930's rolls royce limo hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components aren't mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesn't come together like it should and that's a shame with a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good movie br br the film is about an american showgirl jean harlow seeking a rich british husband preferably from the nobility she meets franchot tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy's employer harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction br br however tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german 5th columnist on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a mata hari type benita hume and harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of tone's murder in fact tone recovers from the wounds br br harlow flees to france where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy french cad cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash in the following scene tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold digger harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movie plot device break downs in the story br br then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman hume who shot him she is on hand to watch her paramour grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both hume and tone dimly recognize each other but simply can't place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse br br this is inexplicable and unnecessary hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn't able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issue br br the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to preserve the french public's perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story br br what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant's reputation meanwhile harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow rekindles feelings for him too at film's end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant's death after grant's hero's burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade out that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long suffering first husband reunited with harlow br br it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been
<START> some good movies keep you in front of the tv and you are dying to see the result br br this movie does not have highs and lows it simply describes a young girl's family life in africa people come and go the weather and the background are all the same br br
<START> the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male prostitute villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis br br the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovar's use of surrealism although both styles are similar br br the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
<START> what a waste of time and money my hubby and i saw this movie after seeing the previews and thinking it might be funny wrong this movie is about 90 minutes too long the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out the jokes are weak and tired and not even seeing wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film the special effects aren't i half expected to see the harness and wires holding up uma in her flying scenes and when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero's faster than a speeding bullet flying or fight scenes they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen which hid the awful effects quite nicely wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co worker the sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny i guess i just expected too much from these actors none of the characters were really sympathetic so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them the only memorable performances were the kids who played bedlam and g girl as teenagers at least they had some chemistry overall a super stinko movie i wouldn't even recommend it as a rental it would still be a waste of money
<START> the british horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the seventies but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced the wickerman blood on satan's claw and the house that dripped blood made the future seem rosy even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one thtdb has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist if it hadn't actually been assembled in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is naturally my favourite cushing's life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle sensitive man death and the maiden rip peter
<START> the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film br br i have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night dan in real life steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast br br the dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter walton's family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea br br do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film
<START> in 1993 with the success of the first season of batman the animated series warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie originally slated for direct to video but bumped up to theatrical status it would become known as batman mask of the phantasm ten years after phantasm we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb sub zero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman joins the family br br the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line br br the animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for batman the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons aka the new batman adventures it's quite nicely done and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation there is also some use of cgi but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub zero the music was alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent shaped hearts br br kevin conroy as always does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman it's also great to have the old batman the animated series alumni back that includes bob hastings commissioner gordon robert costanzo detective bullock tara strong barbara gordon batgirl her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond and efrem zimbalist jr alfred br br villains were also great especially given that rupert thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season br br overall while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan you will love the five minute short chase me
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other people's opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear i'm amazed there weren't any group hug moments br br i think i jumped once and that's because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichÃ©d birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen br br and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my mom's shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my mom's shawl that didn't match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived god br br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet he's hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and it's the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies aren't even this predictable br br i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't buy it for 15 00 and then hate it it was just bad it would've been better if only one thing would've happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that would've been br br don't waste your time or money go see a good movie
<START> when sam peckinpah's superlative the wild bunch 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so with a talented if whisky marinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah's epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that category br br soldier blew er blue tells the story of foul mouthed new yorker cresta lee candice bergen a blonde proto hippie chick who's been rescued from two years of captivity among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the fiancÃ©e she only wants to marry for his money also on board the wagon she's traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills accompanied by honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman calling gant by the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader Â played by donald pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and that's saying something Â and in the tradition of many previous western set romantic comedies each other br br during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably Â and predictably Â attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on Â while gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less Â in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn't filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby to be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what's coming br br what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded Â a nice effect i have to admit Â women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated Â in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act Â and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs no joke this scene would instantly garner an nc 17 rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted br br i'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it's a heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well duh then it's a light hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of buck toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub plot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery br br but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy mulligan stew of presumably well intentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity
<START> i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife i am not sure of her character's name i went to byu with her and lost touch with her her maiden name was kim luke and i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tear jerker on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting' more like 'portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation' something like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the way thanks melissa thorne
<START> if my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy a funny look at the adult entertainment industry if that's what it's supposed to be it doesn't really work it just isn't that funny setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy failure aside since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter i'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour except to say that if this is true the life is pretty dull br br for over an hour this movie really doesn't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren't giving full service a euphemism for actual sex as for the girls themselves betty's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is well leah is a somewhat strange undefined character with a nipple fetish true who seems to be in the business because well because she's in it i have no idea what her character was about those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business br br the movie meanders about and doesn't offer much until the twist reveals conrad to be the bad guy we should have gotten to that point sooner the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story conrad's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls that plan for revenge was pretty good and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been a fairly funny movie br br the performances from the 4 leads were all ok although i didn't think anyone came across as outstanding all four characters were a bit shallow cindy was a sympathetic character and so was conrad for a while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie given the subject matter there's surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene in fact there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this as for the overall quality of the movie it's a low budget effort which shows although you expect a certain griminess i suppose of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour so that's forgivable it certainly says something though that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer director soo lyu's resume and given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry that it wasn't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards the canadian version of the oscars 4 10 and i'm being a bit generous with that
<START> i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie romantic interest or damsel in danger but everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l a confidential and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance however after that moment her career did not follow the ideal path sure the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies like people i know or the door in the floor but we have never seen her again on a substantial character the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation and it is not only that her character is not too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic however basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points this movie is full of clichÃ©s and generic villains the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous i do not recommend while she was out at all this film commits the capital sin of being boring
<START> let's cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabian nights style there's an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved sabu with the djinn's foot though
<START> tressa's vocal performance was outstanding tressa played the female singer role while richard was in the club when she first step out on stage and started to riff and strut her stuff it made my soul shake her voice is platinum she needs to make a cd she has more fans then she realizes i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats which she also starred with leon when she was younger how can a little girl have a voice so big she is truly amazing good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice back shaking tear crying uplifting take you back in the days voice tressa if you read this commit please take my advice and start recording a cd if not just for the love of singing but for your fans i believe you can truly make it look at these other one hit single studio singers lol
<START> this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad unfortunate death at the box office i saw this film at a local art cinema in revival form shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas it certainly deserves to be approached a second time or even a third sandra b takes it to the limit by doing spoken word taking on some well known songs in this piece her version of hank william's 'i'm so lonesome i could cry' could easily move you to tears maybe someday audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously but not without some well placed laughs too the film moves at a brisk pace thanks to some nice editing so that some viewers will not find it stale boring perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline
<START> wilhelm grimm alexander knox stands trial for nazi crimes three witnesses give evidence father warecki henry travers wilhelm's brother karl erik rolf and wilhelm's former lover marja marsha hunt before wilhelm speaks in his own defense the film ends after the court sums up br br the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna shirley mills who wilhelm is accused of raping the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie grimm richard crane denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina dorothy morris marja's daughter after she has been shot at a brothel br br throughout the film knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter resentful and evil man martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished
<START> simply i found the tv show mash trite preachy oh ever so politically correct repetitious pretentious and biggest sin of all and that is that it is was incredibly dull you have alan alda as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his cleverness that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both mclean stevson and wayne rogers whom i'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike farrell both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread loretta swit which i also found dull also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at and gary burghoff who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on seeing one show a year showed that to me jamie farr was just low brow comedy and is not even worth really mentioning here at all the reason i did not give it a one rating which anyone reading this by now would be wondering is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call but a relative one television except for relatively few exceptions is such crud that relatively speaking mash had some production quality by television standards of that era and today and therefore it is deserved of a two rob ritter
