<START> spoilers br br i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re aired thursday night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all br br i think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard br br out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next
<START> the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes it gives the basic summary of what is going on this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is all you will learn about them the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie i have never played the video game but know people who have from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters
<START> i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plot kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst films if you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it this was on a friday night the 9 50 showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
<START> all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i've ever seen it's an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way
<START> the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script it grabs the reader audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who s not who he says he is however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that i ve seen
<START> what a stinkeroo this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second rate the supporting cast insufferable i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography and i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown
<START> i'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot anyway i've seen several reviewers call isoyg an 'anti rape' film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims br br first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie that's right a shapely woman's behind whether it was zarchi's attempt to make an anti rape statement and i absolutely don't believe it was is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it br br the rape s in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch there's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before he's murdered so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level really it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowd br br finally a few reviewers have commended zarchi's so called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn caliber actors do their thing br br i'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg i'm all for exploitation horror and love video nasties in fact i'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho hum mostly gore less murders and wait for the credits to roll br br this is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but i'm telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
<START> kabei our mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan a real weeper i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film making from the 1940's and 1950's that i've come to love so much such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures the title credits even begin in the same way with the japanese letters characters in red against neutral color burlap material i immediately thought this director loves ozu the same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes even a couple of pillow shots as roger ebert calls them the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another br br the story follows the lives of a japanese family before and during and after world war two the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a university professor is arrested for anti war sympathies he's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls but war starts and he's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war br br there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress sayuri yoshinaga she's almost a madonna type she's so beautiful big soulful eyes and flawless skin the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is tadanobu asano what a sensitive performance there is no macho in him at all he's gentle and kind i'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies i think i'll check to see what's available for them the two little child actresses are wonderful too br br the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences with very easy to read english subtitles i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty four eyes 1954 don't miss this film
<START> first and foremost i loved the novel by ray bradbury it's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine i as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with a great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam grier br br how could it fail br br there may be spoilers within br br first of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the book gone everything that made you squirm gone br br and then there's the acting like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasn't addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces br br you'd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here it's like they just don't care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances br br pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn't well pulled off she's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book br br and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jim's house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merry go round the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more br br and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merry go round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything br br i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil don't see this movie but read the book it's a classic of bradbury
<START> jason lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation but the movie just fails to make a connect br br perhaps because julia stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin in law br br maybe it is because she and selma blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way selma blair seems more conniving than julia would be br br either way this movie is yet another hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin which while having promise fails to deliver br br there are some laughs to be sure and the cast even if miscast do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic so instead of getting a successful raunch fest ie animal house or american pie we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity ala meatballs 2 or something
<START> extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel br br what was even worse was marlon brando's performance his southern drawl was ridiculous i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost brando so great in previous films was reduced here to a laughing stock tyrone power in witness for the prosecution should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here br br the film dealing with racism dealt with the u s government's attempt to avoid marriages between u s soldiers and japanese women br br brando was stone faced throughout the movie his moving from anti these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views br br only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances nothing about either performance was equally impressive umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka who did nicely as brando's love interest she showed great emotion as the anti american who found love with the brando character her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living br br martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in the ten commandments to the bigoted mother of brando's love interest at first her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted patricia owens as brando's first love showed depth and conviction in her performance
<START> i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone knightwing this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it
<START> good movies are original some leave a message or touch you in a certain way but sometimes you're not in the mood for that br br i wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when i watched this one it started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review well in the end the movie lost it's credibility the storyline wasn't that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was ok so more than enough to satisfy my needs but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling they should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category so in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don't watch otherwise i'd say go ahead
<START> this was one of the best movies i have seen the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be exhilarating to watch br br some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations br br most of the cast are newcomers to the industry however they all pulled it off very well everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately br br i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways
<START> notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen br br the box makes this movie out to look Âwell ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world br br the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terrible br br please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch br br in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it
<START> i know nothing of the iliad so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story however as a stand alone film i found this very boring the battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious cgi br br the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies but he does not make a good warrior too pretty i am afraid br br good points are is the design this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings walls impressive i do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely we hear american scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation br br all in all i do not recommend this film for a family sit down it is too long and the young will get bored br br for adults it is ok if you don't care about the lack realism
<START> the film 52 pick up simply does not work see it if you are at all interested in elmore leonard or john frankenheimer or anyone in the terrific cast especially john glover who's admittedly brilliant but the book a slow burning noir thriller with lots of pulp should have translated into an oscar contending film instead of this dud that couldn't figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard boiled gritty crime story of the book or opt for a 1980s schwarzenegger shoot em up spree shifting the scene from the original locale in the book detroit an area where leonard has resided for years and knows very well to los angeles makes for a substantial problem that leonard tries to fix in his script but ultimately can't it was for example a clever device making mitchell's wife a city councilwoman she had no job in the book if you think about it that's the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex crazed city like 1980s los angeles for adultery or any type of potential sex scandal even then it's more plausible in a more conservative eastern state like michigan to believe that a its tiny porno industry is a sleazy money grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not so stupid upper middle class fellow going through a mid life crisis and b adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with if their upstanding careers and old fashioned wives couldn't handle the shock as consultant ron jeremy will tell you 1980s los angeles was a colorful stylish porno mecca more like the movie boogie nights than leonard's dark shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses grimy apartments and drug deals in depressed urban squalor then again los angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there unfortunately roy scheider's harry mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy handsome uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat in the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing he also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for but never appeared to come to grips with elmore leonard's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law abiding citizen here harry mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer alan raimy turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom makes for such a central image glover's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence but scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky good guy in charge of the situation as if he were more a rambo with an m 16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him 52 pick up ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film trapping raimy inside mitchell's jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by mitchell plays to an audience wanting the sweet revenge conclusion of a chuck norris movie not the intelligent balanced world of leonard's book where mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way i left the theater shaking my head and depressed what a waste of talent
<START> ossessione br br luchino visconti's debut film this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement well it says so right on the back of the box and is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux set in fascist italy an assortment of supporting characters including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul although visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well developed the spider web of deceit is tenuous although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it the cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos all the same it's incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable
<START> laurence olivier merle oberon ralph richardson and binnie barnes star in the divorce of lady x a 1938 comedy based on a play olivier plays a young barrister everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home the next day a friend of his lord mere richardson announces that his wife barnes spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her believing the woman to be oberon olivier panics oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she's the lady in question lady mere when she's really leslie steele br br we've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time with this cast it's delightful i mean richardson and olivier olivier and oberon that great team in wuthering heights pretty special olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister oberon gives her role the right light touch she looks extremely young here fuller in the face with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her she wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair do she's ready to play snow white binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere br br the color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration definitely worth seeing
<START> the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines they appear in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions davies haines are a wonderful team too bad they never made a talkie together and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glynn and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still maligned marion davies
