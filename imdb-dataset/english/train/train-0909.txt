<START> i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn't finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts i don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee
<START> shintarÃ´ katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character zatoichi the zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers he's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive i've actually seen every movie it is because of this i saw this final installment of the hanzo the razor series as i assumed it would be very similar and boy was i wrong it turns out that the hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of women who deserve it you see hanzo is a policeman from the meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his penis of steel how he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe but it certainly is not for the squeamish br br overall i just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films however from looking at the other reviews i can see that they are still very popular and that is pretty scary despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes the films just are like brain pollution and i'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women
<START> just saw this exquisite 1982 movie return of the soldier based on rebecca west's novel its about a shell shocked fortyish captain who doesn't even tell his wife he has returned to british soil but remains in a hospital in london he's lost his memory and is a boy again with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier its a delicate story he is lingering in his boyhood while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society living with them is his cousin jenny who loved chris baldry the soldier when they were growing up as playmates but has settled into spinsterhood the lower class woman played by glenda jackson is margaret gray it is she who is notified that chris is back in england chris' wife kitty is shocked when mrs gray comes to tell her that chris is in a hospital in london kitty julie christie is vacuous and snobbish why she asks herself was this other woman sent a telegraph about chris rather than her chris has forgotten totally about kitty he wants to renew his relationship with margaret the now married margaret is reluctant to meet him but then does and continues to meet with him there is a psychiatrist ian holm who warns kitty and jenny that chris' temporary happiness with margaret will disappear if he 'cures' him jenny realizes how empty kitty is for chris and forms a secret loving alliance through margaret they both are in love with him jenny wants to help late in the film kitty reveals that chris and she had a boy who died five years ago telling chris this weighs the shrink will certainly restore him to 'normal ' but is this a good idea chris barely aware that he and kitty were ever married is unaware of his child and the child's death the psychiatrist just learning of the child believes such knowledge will restore chris jenny and margaret have chris all to themselves because kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept chris's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties the film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with chris br br but jenny and margaret in the child's perfectly maintained bedroom with kitty too in the novel but not in the screenplay discuss what they believe should be done about chris from their separate perspectives margaret is the critical one here because though married she has half fallen in love with chris again jenny's social stature jenny believes will be threatened if chris does not right himself she does not reveal this to margaret however margaret decides looking ahead that chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time but must return to something like a real life while kitty and jenny look on from the window of the house margaret approaches chris outside and tells him of his lost son the buoyant war victim's head sinks his shoulders slump he looks away he walks dejectedly toward the house fin br br i read some criticism of this first novel of rebecca west the novel was written something after the first war the movie is never quite clear who jenny is his cousin or his sister it would be more rousing if she were his sister of course the criticism doesn't make it clear either i'm sure west in her novel makes sure jenny is her cousin not her sister west is no henry miller nor an anais nin whose book incest about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child i considered reading but then decided against rebecca the author has a need to restore chris too she too has outposts in her head for the society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more
<START> creep is a new horror film that without a doubt will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous it has many genuine shock moments a whole lot of repulsive gore sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that didn't bother me for one second when the end credits start to roll there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director writer christopher smith in his debut seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin rushing action instead of long soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the creep in the london subway the story revolves on the young and haughty kate who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film she falls asleep in the subway misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills kidnaps people to experiment upon even experienced homeless people security guards or sewer workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster i really dug the creep character he's nauseating hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background i reckon this isn't very original and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely jeepers creepers style that particular film started out great as well but as soon as the creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort the obvious aspect to love is the outrageous gore there's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make up as well as the sound effects are very convincing the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used there also is some acting talent present in this film with franka potenta run lola run returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film anatomie creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film
<START> the symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken even the title has a least four meanings that i can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story
<START> sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors but this one is bad br br brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie br br alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside she was stiff throughout the movie br br i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work i would have guessed that they were first year students br br ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line ed certainly has not lost his charisma i wish i'd taken the time to meet him while he was here br br i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i've been there i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere i was sadly disappointed br br sorry
<START> with this movie it's all about style atmosphere and acting true i didn't believe all of the plot developments but it didn't matter the terrific acting the unexpected plot twists and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride and i had a great time kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent he's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles robert downey jr embeth davidtz from schindler's list and fallen tom berenger daryl hannah and robert duvall that i was simply blown away i recently bought a copy of this movie and i never tire of watching it simply one of the best thrillers of the year if you've ignored this movie and chances are you have then i suggest you check it out
<START> the 1998 michael keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it's um shoddy special effects but compared to what screaming mad george cooked up for this horror comedy they're positively mind boggling the killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts which they probably were the cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other much worse movies and paul keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role
<START> the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didn't take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend terrible direction pedestrian camera work sporadically bad to nearly passable acting chintzy effects and one of the worst screenplays i've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and mutilated in a long long time best laughs actually come from the making of featurette in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week wait except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi the birds hedren of all people into doing a bit part along with kane friday the 13th hodder how this came to pass i'll never know and to be honest i don't really care watch at your own risk and don't say you haven't been warned this is film making at its pretentious craven worst it only gets a 2 from me for having some good looking naked women and even then just barely
<START> i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the 60 s and maybe not in the events murders and even more that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesn't like black white films this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public its 12 years old now but i just saw it for the first time i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i haven't seen it anywhere in sweden ofcorse there is internet but not for anyone in the world the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crime history and was big in the 50 60 s in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess well it was told about for some time but 40 years later it will fade away in for example europa cause time goes by we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think it will boost interest to the events that took place some 50 years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blake version so it wasn't that bad huh this are my opinions some people will of course disagree but hey its okay sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films its not every time the old ones are that good the film making techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today its always a question of money of course there has been so many movies that were made in the good old days but there were also money missing bad directors etc and they remakes them today 50 years later and suddenly they are okay to watch my friend got this box of old classic horror movies and s f and i cant say i was impressed of the so called good old days most of them you cold put in the trashcan directly they were so bad that we just sat there like zombies could not move like brain dead i cant recommend them to anyone some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them but not the originals they were just painful awful this is like the old story of who was the best bond moore or connery i think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like thanks for me and i am sorry for my english thats not so good lars from sweden
<START> this film seems to be completely pointless there is no reason why anything that happens in it happens as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought how can i wrap this up and what were jared harris and christopher walken thinking did they do it for a bet i couldn't tell you the plot i'm not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank but if there is it didn't register jared and his bird go to ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up as you do they go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it meet christopher walken who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat he brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him from then on it all gets a bit silly a couple of hours of my life that i'd like back
<START> i'm not aware of largo winch as a comic book or is it graphic novel i actually don't know but i have to admit hearing about an agent hero movie i did expect quite something different than what i actually got br br while it was startling to watch this at first it was nice watching this move along you could never really tell where it would go some twists are foreseeable but in general you can never really say were it will end up going a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast make this an enjoyable watch not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that but a really good mixture
<START> this and hidden fortress are the kurosawa's that are most dear to me i don't hand out 10's like candy but this certainly deserved it if anything even though it's quite long like all kurosawa's pretty much are it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example hidden fortress did despite its lenght there wasn't a single minute i would cut out br br this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way it has no storyline but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline unlike any other kurosawa film i have seen so far it also leans much on the dialogue which he uses brilliantly especially in the story between the father and the son planning their new house br br still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically without pointing fingers at anybody at any point from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance
<START> this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching everything was unbelievably clichÃ© and retarded the acting was horrible too the camera work wasn't bad but that still couldn't redeem it the writer director of this film must suffer from down's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled disappearances i don't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least 20 for my time pain and suffering in conclusion the director writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street
<START> to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close up followed by another two and half minute freeze frame of ms streisand striking a christ like pose behind the closing credits over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbra's distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego that just might be some sort of cinematic record br br or think about this the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while streisand's songs are performed in their entirety including the interminable finale her costar kris kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duet br br or consider this streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get co directing credit as well one of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her then boyfriend and former hairdresser jon peters as such streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction what it doesn't explain is how come given every opportunity to make the great diva look good their efforts only make streisand look bad even though this was one of streisand's greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance br br anyway moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex drugs and rock'n'roll streisand plays esther hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with kristofferson's john norman howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to has beenville in the previous incarnations of the story norman maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer vicky lester achieve her success in the feminist seventies streisand co want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one he's a burden she must endure in the name of love as such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit br br kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical the two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom and indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist br br but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim they don't seem to be aware just how cold blooded and self absorbed she is but sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from esther blodgett so that streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive so much for ethnic pride br br the backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees and the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the oscar winning evergreen by paul williams and streisand but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be a vanity project
<START> let me give a quick summery of the film a rotten rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam a rapping genie like all genies he grants 3 wishes but being good natured also helps max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime during all this kazaam raps from time to time also showcasing shaq's dismal rap skills br br this movie proves what we all know athletes need to stick to sports i admit that it never looked like an oscar worthy movie but everything about this waste of film is horrible the characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and shaq is only a quarter of the problem hell even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big no pun intended at the time i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws
<START> so don't even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie you'd think that jj abrahams had written this movie basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust also why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay i mean cgi animation for an aardman movie obviously aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing wrong wrong wrong nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain but everything else about the movie is dull dull dull i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie no wait actually i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie it's just terrible but thankfully it's not as bad as shrek
<START> john cassavetes' opening night is fantastic and fascinating fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination fascinating because it never ceases surprising us with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes anyone who appreciates characters won't be able to take their eyes off the screen br br the story of an unstable actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands trying to put herself together for a play fighting her demons opening night is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world all of cassavetes' characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater so half of the film takes place on a stage either where the performers do their job or at backstage where producers and writers and directors do their job br br cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience but the audience in the cinema because there is another audience in the theater of the film that doesn't know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance and that's essentially what it is it's just that the audience in the theater doesn't get to see 'backstage' the way we do they don't experience gena rowlands' exuberance before she goes out to that stage but most importantly they don't know the reasons why she acts the way she does br br i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor myrtle rowland says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer it would be really difficult to tell when he's saying the truth because i would know he's an actor and he can fake anything at any time a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her throughÂwe suspect if she's being real the rest of the characters suspect too br br there is the writer sarah joan blondell who can't understand why myrtle doesn't understand the character she's written for her there's the director manny ben gazzara who can't accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it the producer david paul stewart who doesn't know where to stand and myrtle's co star maurice cassavetes himself who can't deal with the love they have for each other br br when she witnesses the death of a teenager a fan all of this comes together and affects myrtle but no one knows if her delusions are for real they don't say anything because they don't want to upset her but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts at times we can tell that everyone has had it during these moments cassavetes' brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them br br here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking just like cassavetes' way of making cinema and in this aspect the performances are more important here than in shadows because the characters are involved in a bigger picture a bigger story that steps out of the trivial br br but in another aspect the actual way of making cinema this movie is no different from shadows there's a beautiful thing in the way al ruban's camera shoots the characters when someone's talking the camera doesn't focus on him it shoots the person who is listening so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one's saying sometimes they don't care sometimes they are happy sometimes devastated br br improvisation might still be there though among all these wonderful performances near the end there's an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking non stop whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder we have just got to watch and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it showsÂit doesn't get more natural than that
<START> i should qualify that title now that i think about it checkout is not entirely worthless i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense so i guess it's worth something for that and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word not a single original thought went into this movie which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie it is definitely not the next clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done i even heard someone groan in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made
