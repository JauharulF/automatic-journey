<START> what an insult to the sa film industry i have seen better sa films the comments i read about hijack stories by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary a movie's rating should not depend on oh a movie from a developing country lets boost their industry by saying nice things about their work even though it is bad we have the expertise to make good movies don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think hijack stories is we can tell great stories such as cry the beloved country and shaka zulu cry the beloved country i'll give 9 out of 10 great directing by darryl great acting by two great elderly actors irrespective from where they are hijack stories i'll give 1 out of 10 it could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores i would've done the same if it was my movie
<START> 'shock corridor 1963 ' was my first film from samuel fuller and there i was impressed with the director's astute blending of b movie and big budget aesthetics even if the story itself was pure schlock 'pickup on south street 1953 ' was released a decade earlier in fuller's career obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio twentieth century fox nevertheless the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw naturalistic element to the photography not unlike dassin's 'the night and the city 1950 ' and kazan's 'panic in the streets 1950 ' the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald in some scenes fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus bluntly registering the intimate thoughts emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features the eye though unexpectedly prone to melodrama and with just a hint of anti communist propaganda 'pickup on south street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting Â the underground of new york city br br when just out of prison pickpocket skip mccoy richard widmark snags the purse of a woman on the subway jean peters he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for the woman candy and her cowardly ex boyfriend joey richard kiley had been smuggling top secret information to the communists and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro film will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities or sell it to the highest bidder if 'pickup on south street' has a flaw it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti communist agenda reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii dwight taylor who supplied the story also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home 1944 ' the only propagandistic movie of the series for no apparent reason every identifiable character Â even the smugly self serving skip mccoy Â eventually becomes a self sacrificing patriot the transformation predictable from the outset in traditional film noir the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance the rational punishment for his sins but apparently not when they've served their country patriotism wipes the slate clean br br richard widmark an actor who i'm really beginning to like plays the haughty pickpocket with composure though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew the opening scene on the train is the film's finest as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag recalling bresson's 'pickpocket 1959 ' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it though of course she draws the line at commies jean peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow legged strut of a prostitute nevertheless peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism fascinatingly upon its release 'pickup on south street' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite go figure
<START> this movie is little more than poorly made fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i don't believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned it's sex with a guy in a bear suit don't spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me i'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price br br i may have to see another of this particular director's films as he seems to have a certain following but if it's anything like this i will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever
<START> jonathan demme's directorial debut for roger corman's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks in chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid beauteous russ meyer starlet eric vixen beyond the valley of the dolls gavin gives a robust winning performance as a brassy resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy hellish penitentiary the always fabulous barbara steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean crippled sexually frustrated warden her erotic dream about doing a slow steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly longtime favorite 70's b movie actress roberta the arousers unholy rollers collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward foul mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut busting dirty joke about pinnochio lynda gold a k a crystin sinclaire of tobe hooper's eaten alive and curtis harrington's ruby makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat crazy alice and the ever cuddly cheryl rainbeaux smith does a lovely touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from lemora a child's tale of the supernatural br br although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language nudity rape and violence it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force demme's zesty confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior furthermore both tak fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and john cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100 on the money excellent patrick wright sheriff mack in the uproariously awful cheap rubber monster suit creature feature howler track of the moonbeast has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom lively rousing and immensely enjoyable caged heat qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive in movie fans
<START> i was watching this movie at one of my usual time which is real real late at night usually if a movie doesn't interest me i start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake br br at first i thought that's what i had to do since this movie's pacing started off slow along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time but after a bit i start getting more into the movie as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling by the end you feel like you've known him your whole life the movie kept my interest so much that i didn't even know the sun was about to rise br br not much of lynch's bizzare style but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing
<START> as a kid i thought this movie was great it had animals it had beautiful music and it had my favorite actor michael j fox now i still love this movie for different reasons it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera it has beautiful well written musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fast paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry even when people hum it and it has my favorite actor michael j fox br br based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overly trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow a witty and vain but still smart cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog chance the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away dismayed and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives a truly incredible journey so what maybe home is just over that mountain but what if it isn't br br i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that yeah everyone go watch it
<START> rob estes josie bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them br br basically rob and josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid like not so fodder they rob and josie move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house br br rob builds furniture i think which is close enough to frank lambert's patrick duffy construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal mockage br br josie is some sort of cookie making queen though it doesn't look like she makes any of the cookies not close enough to carol foster's suzanne somers hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage br br unlike step by step they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another's last names or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together br br anyhow there are eight kids moira sandy jeff lily daisy nathan andrew l and andrew b i personally think they should've just called the younger andrew 'andy' br br there's a lot of product placement particularly for soup at hand which is disgusting and listerine pocket packs there are also some stupid senseless moments it's also not a great film to promote happy families br br but hey rob estes this concludes my review of 'step by step on some really bad drugs ' watch it for rob estes and his pretty eyes there are some great pretty eyes shots
<START> devil dog sets your heart racing it's brilliantly paced the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being you'll never look at your dog the same way again in fact you'll start thinking of having it put down by a priest fantastic
<START> this 1973 tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original surprise br br first the good things lee j cobb makes a terrific barton keyes he's not as good as edward g robinson of course but he's the only reason to watch this this remake's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola dietrichson the step daughter of the femme fatale phyllis dietrichson br br and that's it for the good things br br the bad things are many the director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted you'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening because of modern bad taste the film must be in color instead of black and white because of 1970s bad taste all the sets are distractingly ugly walter neff's expensive apartment in particular is hideous br br the modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s so mr dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance men stopped wearing hats which prevents walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white haired mr dietrichson women in mourning stopped wearing veils which robs samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene oddly lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them br br stephen bochco keeps much of the billy wilder raymond chandler script the same but he makes a lot of tiny inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular outrageously the famous motorcycle cop banter is gone but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post production cut where those lines should have been bochco may not be to blame br br richard crenna is passable as walter neff what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid phyllis dietrichson instead we get samantha eggar who comes off like a standard issue villainess from barnaby jones but who can blame eggar with a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well
<START> on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind warm the heart and touch the very soul lou is such a film i got lou from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business she watched it for a second time with me we were both enthralled her as if for the first time again br br lou is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place it does this while being relentlessly entertaining bret carr's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like stuttering innocence but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax i saw my wife in tears for the second time br br as a life coach i facilitate individual growth and transformation and this film is a must see for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation it is a brilliant creative masterpiece with the power to change lives
<START> dressed to kill is surely one of the best horror thriller movies ever made it's taut stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence the acting is pretty good the orchestral score by pino donaggio is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued dressed to kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife angie dickinson her teenage son keith gordon her psychoanalyst michael caine and a high price call girl nancy allen the murderer in the film is a transsexual named bobbi who is also one of caine's patients the film is full of breathtaking moments the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well highly recommended
<START> seriously this is one of the most stupid family shows of all time br br plot a family without a mother and 3 dads raise 3 little girls in san francisco california br br characters neat freak danny cartoon loving joey hair obsessed jesse spoiled brat michelle stupid dj and almost normal stephanie the creators of this show really want you to hate the characters don't they br br therefore i do not think anyone should watch this show i only chuckled at a few moments in the show's whole running and i think that instead of lethal injection all criminals should be forced to watch this show a torture far worse than anything else br br 1 5 10 or d
<START> for starters i would like to say that i'm a fan of the american pie series even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series br br first of all the best part of the film was that it was an american pie film which is always appreciated br br however there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film first of all the story has a very stale 'arc' structure first there is the introduction of the characters then the pledging of the beta house and finally the greek olympiad each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length apart from the general staleness of the plot there is little to no character development which makes a double whammy of a bad plot br br apart from that i deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film that is showing the jocks as the extremely cool only thinking about sex guys and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior also it shows females only as sexual objects and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects br br apart from that the acting was also poor with perhaps the exception of steve talley br br so in the end a generally horrid film if seen from a critical point of view if seen from a teen point of view i guess that it's better but this film is rated 18 in most countries so it shouldn't really be seen by minors
<START> kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv adaptation of jane austenÂ´s novel when i read that novel i was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story for honestly she is so terribly self righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously kate beckinsaleÂ´s interpretation however saves emma from herself so to speak she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view and one canÂ´t help but give in and like not to say love her in spite of her less amiable qualities kate beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this tv series is so delightful raymond coulthard is perfect as mr frank churchill expressing this characterÂ´s personal magnetism to the full which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996 screen adaptation of emma and mark strong samantha morton bernard hepton and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles this production is in short a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure
<START> i wasn't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7 foot leather aproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough 'hero' with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don't bother with this one
<START> the best cheech chong movie so far of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far i think i've seen them all about twelve times at least and i love them all but this is most definitely the best compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs part of the texts are still part of our language today after 25 years i hope that one day they can make another one because they still are great comedians i heard they are writing a new script so who knows i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them
<START> big splashy film of the broadway music nathan frank sinatra loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games blonde loving adelaide vivian blaine wants to marry him if he gives up craps he decides on one last game when sky masterson marlon brando who bets big is in town he bets sky that he can't get mission worker sarah brown jean simmons to go with him to havana that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie br br this is a real mixed bag there's some wonderful stuff here the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end also brando is really quite good here it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off i have to admit seeing big bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long suffering girlfriend her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here br br now for the bad parts jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab colorless role and can't do much with it the movie is far too long at 150 minutes the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened also most of the characters speak in very precise english contractions are never used maybe it's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie br br it's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while i give it a 7
<START> battlestar gallactica was so great because it had tight writing a great look excellent actors and interesting stories and yeah had hot men and women running around in and out of uniform br br caprica was just lazy lazy writing actors smoking up a storm to give them character outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else yes that is a ford focus sitting in the background lots and lots of teenage angst lots of gyrating naked women but in the background which i'm sure will be cut for the series and a token view of some men in towels none of the actors except polly walker took my attention at all at an hour and a half i was still wondering when it was going to be over br br so what exactly is it that's supposed to bring me back the science fiction it's awfully light on that the actors besides polly walker's fine turn there isn't much interesting being done here there aren't even any hotties in the cast except for maybe esai although for the younger set he's pretty old since he's over 25 br br i loved bsg i was skeptical when i heard about caprica and unfortunately i think i'm right i predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at scifi and get to work making this more than the oc on another planet
<START> while the premise of the film is pretty lame ollie is diagnosed with hornophobia the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick it's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one probably since this was the last hal roach produced laurel and hardy film in fact it wouldn't be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos something true laurel and hardy films never would do they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack br br stan and ollie work at a horn factory this sounds pretty funny but it isn't not surprisingly with all the racket ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work the doctor james finlayson in his last film with the team recommends an ocean voyage however they don't like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother once they are on the boat a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea fortunately this portion of the film actually was well paced and the very end worked out very well br br while not a great full length laurel and hardy film it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers like in the devil's brother or babes in toyland additionally there is still a decent amount of physical comedy something you would see almost none of after this film part of this was due to the boys' declining health and ollie's increasing girth and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films
<START> not that i dislike childrens movies but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities m j fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted hugh laurie can be amazingly funny but is not given the chance in this movie itÂ´s sugar coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age see toy story monsters inc or shrek instead 3 10
