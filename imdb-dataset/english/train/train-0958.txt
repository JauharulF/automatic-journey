<START> this movie has the made for tv stink all over it though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap nevertheless this dvd does have an excellent extra feature covering letters from the wwi front lines thus making this rental not a total waste of my time
<START> what is cry freedom like it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people main character of the story is donald woods kevin kline chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa woods writes several articles where he speaks critically about views of steve biko denzel washington soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa right from the top even from the chief of police when biko dies in police custody woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place so world can find out the truth br br attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with main message that black and white are the same cause we are all people story leads us to south africa and this movie is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie this is movie from which we all can learn something although it is a bit long this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko br br also relationship between woods and biko was shown great just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through but sometimes sacrifices must be made biko's death so the truth could be reveled woods book
<START> i doubt much of this film is based on a true story at the beginning it says based on a true story sort of i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino br br anyways it begins with domino talking to lucy liu who works for the fbi domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars through flashbacks we see domino as a child then as a model and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off ed and choco they let her join the group she's tough can use any kind of weapon and will use her good looks if needed br br they get involved with a scam that clarmont a bailsman has going along the way the group starts a reality tv show and that's where ian zering and brian austin green become involved they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this br br i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs the editing didn't bother me there's also a lot of violence mainly using guns and blood it could have been a little shorter br br final verdict good enough to watch
<START> iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie i was really disappointed br br ram gopal varma ki aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters there is no camaraderie between heero ajay devgan and raj prashant raj there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use rajpal yadav's voice modulation ineffective and rather pointless mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language rest of the cast was below expectation the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie br br ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag but there is no fire
<START> highly recommended br br a well written funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour give it a go it's good to see an independent british movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios definitely worth adding to any film collection there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack i especially enjoyed the orb's version of jimmy cliff's vietnam and the tower of london's take on freebird br br go on give it a go you won't be disappointed
<START> when i saw this documentary i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again even though serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of yugoslavian breakup it is not mentioned in this documentary which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians and attacked slovenia croatia and bosnia all independent nations recognized by the un breakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government so slovenia croatia macedonia and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests if you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia and fact led documentary this is not it you should watch yugoslavia death of a nation made by discovery channel and bbc
<START> a great funny sweet movie with morgan freeman who plays himself and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet paz vega at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film it shows how a positive attitude can change anything it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty clichÃ© romance it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter a very rare masterpiece
<START> watched this on dvd in original language with english subs either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse it's just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg fight scenes and crap plot i'm certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy
<START> when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool i was excited it's been a personal favorite for years now and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism having just seen it though i was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb especial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast right down to henry's son who was only four in the original like i said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended in this case an unexpected adventure ensues and that's about all i'll give away not to mention the fact that i'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's double crossing who while it was certainly one of the better movies i've seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging i'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 'henry grim' in 2017
<START> i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it in a word it is unfunny unfunny i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage i can't believe that barry levinson didn't just toss this script when he read the first page moreover i can't believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it br br i gave it 3 out of 10 because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck also the horse corky by merely existing as a character in this movie is actually quite ridiculous
<START> cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west not to repeat other reviews here the score is very good and moving literally it means dawn please never comes when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever after 24 years joel and leslie still look great i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow
<START> this is only the second time i've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film the first time was for probably the best movie i've ever seen and that was for memento br br seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento as in the worst film i've had the misfortune to see apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash pile that it is br br let's see apalling effects cliched script bad acting and about 90 minutes too long my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad amazingly i watched it to the end how i did that i don't know avoid
<START> farewell friend aka adieu l'ami honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns on the debit side there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park bronson has a very irritating fonzie like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments brigitte fossey sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a liability Â her i'll cook spaghetti i'll learn to make love well i'll read shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways Â and it's a shame about the horrible last line shot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent print br br cinema club's uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that's no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality
<START> i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre i classify movies only as industrial or non industrial valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best br br as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down to earth since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of humanism noone is entirely good or evil in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved br br the second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hide and seek with her blind date never able to met with katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanaz br br the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines' day celebration at dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know hard rock never suits better within a serial killer mystery movie
<START> this movie is not in anyway funny it tries to be funny with it's lame humor which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing when is this gonna end one thing you have to hand to them is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book even the ones that wasn't funny the first time it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes br br to sum it all up this movie is blonde humor gone bad it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch it is just that bad
<START> magellan33 said you can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member br br i assume then that you never heard of topper br br which in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog ditto br br this was the kind of program that had not gonna make it written allover it from the first episode it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play no one well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp
<START> i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love br br this was the most i'd laughed at one of woody's comedies in years dare i say a decade while i've never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman br br this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends
<START> if i could give it less that 1 i would do not bother to rent if someone gives you the dvd burn it br br this is horrible movie making a total waste of even digital film i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys lommel claims to have written this if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages the story line is none existent the dialog is mainly screaming the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift br br i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a creative film i like david lynch br br this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension i missed it or it is totally pointless i think this is a lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks con job br br i cannot see why lionsgate even bothered with this totally worthless it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director
<START> in an alternate 1950s where an outbreak of the undead caused by a mysterious 'space dust' has been contained through the use of special electronic collars a young loner timmy finds a friend in fido billy connelly his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie br br fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son or for his hot to trot wife played by the gorgeous carrie anne moss having been psychologically scarred as a child when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him br br timmy runs into a spot of bother however when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour with the authorities on fido's trail trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies and his mother forming a bond with their undead house help will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend br br a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick fido is a thoroughly entertaining deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour taking the romero zombie verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that i have seen br br connelly's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame along with day of the dead's bub and return of the living dead's tarman it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse but the big yin's performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus the rest of the cast also give commendable performances with young k'sun ray as timmy and ms moss deserving special mentionsÂray because for one so young he puts in a particularly assured turn and moss because she is so bloody yummy br br this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead and to my surprise it is also the best director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future br br 8 5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for imdb
<START> watch the 1936 version as personally annoying i find charles boyer's voice he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan depressed rudolf i mean omar sharif tries but no too cute and vibrant catherine denueve sp besides being too old looks nothing like marie nothing she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion br br the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance as historically empress elisabeth wasn't involved that much in rudolf's life
