<START> i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 two weeks ago after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly also and amazing show i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see designate this bag 'em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great i've heard some of the plans for the would be season 3 and i have to say i can't believe it was cancelled i won't spoil it for you but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness max's barcode number is 332960073452 and in the two weeks i've had it i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice it's just too good
<START> this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it br br at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film br br the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picture br br hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline
<START> since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie this movie is worth a see if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out the effects are really good as well just think land of the lost i originally watched this movie in the early 90's maybe more like 89 90 on a local channel monster show called morgus presents i didn't scare me but i was 8 and anything b felt more like an a years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins good b movie fun for all ages
<START> fraidy cat the 4th of these cartoons is a good one at least i like it so i'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews br br this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one although it has its moments of comedy the atmosphere is dark and spooky suspense is another strong element here as for humor it's mostly dark humor br br in this short tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts something he believes while tom is scared to death jerry is watching everything and can't help but laugh the whole time in fact jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big ghost br br tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life although jerry scares tom without a good reason the way the story is made ends up being funny plus once again there is no violence here because this is one of tom jerry's oldest cartoons however i don't get that joke of tom's 9 lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner br br when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry's scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him jerry is Â«caught with the hand in the cookie jarÂ» he deserves to be discovered yet tom shows an incredible patience before reacting he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face jerry tries to be funny but tom doesn't laugh br br overall this is a different peculiar and remarkable tom jerry experience
<START> we saw the silent version of this film and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful it's quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created since it is shot with pure silent technique long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle save for a few disconcerting sequences where louise brooks playing a french typist is quite visibly speaking in english the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene where brooks is watching the rushes for her test 'for a sound film' footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song i was unsurprised to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the talkie version had been hailed as an exemplar of new technique br br in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairy tale inevitability of what follows the film resembles a dream as a 'louise brooks movie' it was not at all what i was expecting either from her hollywood comedies or from g w pabst's german melodramas i found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either and brooks herself is a different creature a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shop window vamp or manipulated doll br br but what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half repelled by the rich parasites who cluster around her beauty the pauper princess returns to a tear stained reunion with her humbly born true love and the tale might very well have been ended there fairy tale however turns to tragedy the dilettante grabovsky confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires is yet all too correct in his self interested prediction the young lovers cannot make each other happy and andrÃ© ironically was right to mistrust the social influence of beauty contests after the intoxication of her moment's glory lucienne frets herself to despair over the humdrum routine of married life while her husband in turn is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair if it were a simple case of a mis matched marriage that would be one thing but the true tragedy is that they do love each other br br in many ways prix de beautÃ© reminds me of murnau's sunrise but if so the fairground and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirror image of the joyous reconciliation in sunrise no dream but an alienating nightmare and the following dawn brings not a miraculous reunion but an empty bed and deserted home leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him lucienne vanishes again from andrÃ©'s life in quest of brightness and freedom and this time she will never come back br br gossip columns confirm all andrÃ©'s worst convictions as he learns of his wife's whereabouts through reports coupling her name with grabovsky when the young workman penetrates at last to the lavish sanctum of the screening room it is with drawn gun to be greeted by the sight of his rival courting and caressing a laughing lucienne the same woman who had pledged her undying affection as she left him he kills her but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen lucienne in all her transformed glory as he never saw her the two women are juxtaposed in an endless powerful moment as andrÃ© is seen seized unresisting and pulled away the dying girl and her singing self still projected above caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath her br br the main jarring element in the film is the character of andrÃ©'s co worker antonin who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the licensed butt of his contemporaries' malice he is the ugly one who can never get the girl the ungainly wimp who is tripped and tormented in the washrooms and at work and must take it all with an uncertain ingratiating smile in his fruitless hope for social acceptance a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular in other words but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his tormentors unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists for which i perceive no sign the character seems to exist merely as comic relief but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge when we know him only as an inept peeping tom at the waterside it's easy to laugh although the others' revenge seems a little over the top when we discover that he is no chance met stranger but andrÃ©'s colleague and regular sidekick the continuing attacks rapidly cease to be very funny br br but it is the images that remain beauty nightmare and dream
<START> one of my all time favorite so laughably lousy that it's totally lovable el cheapo and stinko nickel'n'dime independent horror creature features an enjoyably dreadful marvel that was released by the formidably fecund exploitation outfit crown international pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless drive ins back in the 70's and eventually wound up being rerun like crazy on several small time secondary cable stations throughout the 80's i naturally first saw this gloriously ghastly abomination on late night television one fateful saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deep seated albeit completely irrational abiding fondness for it ever since br br a meteorite falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a tranquil country lake thereby causing a heretofore dormant dinosaur egg to hatch of course the baby dino immediately grows into a gigantic waddling grunting teeth gnashing prehistoric behemoth with goofy flippers an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp jagged stalagmite like chompers our southern fried male cousin to the loch ness monster promptly starts chowing down on various luckless local yokel residents of a previously quiet and sleepy hillbilly resort town it's up to drippy stalwart sheriff richard cardella assisted by the painfully idiotic hayseed comic relief brotherly fishing guide duo of glenn roberts and mark seigel feisty gal pal kacey cobb and terminally insipid nerdy scientist bob hyman to get to the bottom of things before the over sized gluttonous jurassic throwback ruins the tourist trade by eating all the campers and fisherman that the hick hamlet makes its cash off of br br director co screenwriter william r stromberg displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing atmosphere taut narrative construction and especially eliciting sound credible acting from his hopelessly all thumbs rank amateur community theater level cast the performances are uniformly abysmal cardella is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the pitifully dopey redneck comic antics of roberts and seigel provoke groans of slack jawed disbelief you aren't laughing with these two atrociously mugging clods so much as at them particularly when the insufferable imbeciles discover a severed head bobbing up and down in the murky lake water better yet a clumsily integrated sub plot concerning a vicious on the loose criminal leads to a spectacularly ham fisted supermarket hold up scene which degenerates into a hilariously stupid mini massacre when a young lady shopper interrupts the stick up artist in mid robbery a subsequent car chase is likewise severely bungled as well it's so limply staged and unimpressive that one feels more relieved than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to devour the nefarious fugitive moreover david allen's funky herky jerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic gnarly article projecting a certain raw charisma sneaky reptilian personality and overall forceful screen presence which makes all the horrendously underwhelming human characters seem like pathetically unbecoming nobody bores in comparison and as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our slavering beastie with a bulldozer the operative word for this thrilling confrontation is boffo all the way
<START> i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos it's not a movie it doesn't have a plot nor a central storyline it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long form videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even self parody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
<START> i wanted so much to enjoy this movie it moved very slowly and was just boring if it had been on tv it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes maybe what happened to the story a great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation if this is loosely based on the life of the director why didn't he get someone to see that the writing itself was loose then he directed it at a snail's pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie the music soars but for a different film not this one for soap opera saga possibly there were times when the dialogue was not understandable when armin meuller stahl was speaking i was not alone because i heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom why can't hollywood make better movies this one had the nugget of a great story but was just poorly executed
<START> watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i resisted i don't know what ridley scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and that's also a waste of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in lybia are they still fighting gadafi or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger
<START> down to earth is about lance barton a black comedian who gets hit by a truck he goes to heaven and he gets to get another body lance gets the body of charles wellington a white guy so lance does a few things in the body of charles the movie has a few laughs but it's nothing special it's a good movie if you're a fan of chris rock madagascar the 2005 animated comedy is better this is a good movie but chris rock has done way better things than this it will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie and it's not really laugh out loud funny you'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing
<START> one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does he moves you i concur he was and remains a unique force in film more than a triple threat who could act write and direct he had a genius uniquely suited to film one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter this film certainly reinforces that impression a musician a theatre actor an heir to shakespeare hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film i like the accent i like the face the size the style the mind and the games i love all of his movies and wish there were more i particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there even towards the end when his beauty was ruined perhaps by his own intent he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in rita was a gorgeous blonde a lana turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute another film another hour in his company that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know we all know that there is not part of him not worthy of our time watch it and be grateful for the chance
<START> grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away it was so strange and funny and sad and sick and ÂÂÂ really no words can describe the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre i found out about this film reading my uncle john's great big bathroom reader by the bathroom reader's institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits which i am sure include curtains when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie thumbing my nose at normalcy and society
<START> i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie which is why i left it unwatched for so long but i was very pleasantly surprised br br far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car boat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails with nothing being overstated or over rationalized br br it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding ever stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense who's winning who's dying br br alexandra staden might not be as drop dead gorgeous as monica vitti but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work and the shape of her face her hair and her tall slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic strip graphics br br nikolaj coaster waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch even likable and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies i can't think of a single one of hollywood's former waiters who could have pulled the role off that well br br fortunately blaise baddies always die in the end no spoilers there that's a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes
<START> they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone's vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn't so misleading i'd give it a better review br br but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film br br the book stuart little isn't about a mouse it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse like he's born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on there is a cat named snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him but snowball can't talk br br in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names
<START> i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful br br if you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously br br if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
<START> not knowing what this film was about i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it i enjoyed it little seen multi genre flick from director bernard rose candyman immortal beloved great story and characters as a fan of glenne healdy's i was surprised of her british accent the only exception for this film was the ending however it is worth the rent
<START> as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan i can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted upon me but there is absolutely no reason for this br br rated super action in the blockbuster video section and given the dreaded restricted viewing sticker i'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker ha robert napton could use to get at least 4 50 from one unsuspecting person br br shame on you robert napton shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema you are a disgrace br br there isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action did you use snot on these people oh look they're having a rave in a field like all 6 of them and isn't that an asian guy in the background why is it always daytime why did it take 1 2 of the movie to show anything and more importantly why did we watch the other 1 2 br br ps you owe me 4 50
<START> i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful if there are people who watch this piece and think that well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2 then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why's and 'how's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live what more can a propaganda movie aim for the part in which an american movie about the rothschild family is included is re used very shrewdly here for instance the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked no one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata br br besides the level of excitement or the level of disgust in the movie increases slowly and the solution like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda the audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up well done br br in the movie there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience the movie is kind of history today so no need to fuss much about it actually however in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred violence decivilization as well as the problems of integration overall fine trash
<START> i am a current a s l student was forced to watch this movie in class and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film the film is obviously leaning towards to p o v of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground also the film didn't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic i e deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf is it right or wrong in that instance the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w a capital d not that this is bad but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased
<START> relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these destined to become a 'cult classic' the theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour br br the songs were the most literal i've ever heard in a musical Â don't take the short cut honey there's a wolf in the woods debi mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines br br now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive instead we get joey fatone ex n'syncer living up to his last name as he's not aged well he's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out of tune singing seriously this guy was in vocal group the rest of the actors are semi adequate but can't do much about the unimaginative script you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time Â see under pixar br br on the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors and it wasn't as offensive as crash
