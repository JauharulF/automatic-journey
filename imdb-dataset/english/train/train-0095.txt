<START> in this paranoia driven potboiler our reporter hero battles hindersome authorities duplicitous co workers renegade ufo debunkers and silent skulking aliens though capable of mind control and zapping objects from afar it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons the script clomps from event to event leaving puzzlers aplenty why did the aliens blind the dog why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they're only patrolling an empty landing site and what space dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model inquiring minds want to know writer director mario gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of ufo themed tabloids as he took in a sunn classics double feature the closing screen crawl boasts that it's based on actual events just like plan 9 some may feel burned by the abrupt finale but it should still appeal to conspiracy cranks
<START> as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out at last i thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author wrong if the casting director was intending to cast a jane who was plain he certainly succeeded however surely he could have found one who could also act where was the tension between jane and rochester where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother finally why was the plot changed at the end one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book what a disappointment
<START> jenny neumann from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes the american slasher hell night and others is helen selleck an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production she's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her meanwhile a black gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass br br major spoiler br br the killer is obviously helen she speaks in her dead mother's voice washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavy breathing pov camera work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise br br the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even blackmailing their way into getting laid there's quite a bit of nudity and blood but there's no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by colin eggleston who also scripted and produced is terrible the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi's film of the same name and argento's opera both of which are better than this one by five years though and neumann is pretty hot
<START> i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degrees if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough i do not understand why this show has been cancelled what a fantastic show cast and characters the whole concept is gripping viewing i am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series why is this six degrees is phenomenal it's better than so many other tv programmes out there until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen
<START> as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasn't disappointed br br mystery men was definitely not a high effects tension filled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fart powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy br br though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off guard and bring tears from the belly laughers among us br br i definitely recommend this movie although not an all time classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if you're worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while
<START> it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes in the yoshiwara type green houses circa 1860 give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you won't be disappointed
<START> this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because br br the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool br br overall score out of
<START> if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes'ka den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn't stop delivering what he's infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored but it's not at all a fault of kurosawa's br br the material in dodes'ka den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there's things that happen to these people and kurosawa's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there's not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the 'clickety clack' of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there's the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he's lost a lot more than he'll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i'm not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social around br br there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it's a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it's a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it br br sometimes there's charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawa's cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they've always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it's one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it's like the abstract has come full throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it's a brilliant tricky double edged sword that allows for the dream like intonations with such heavy duty drama br br with a sweet 'movie' score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodes'ka den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality
<START> i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie
<START> i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrock's films and to me this is the funniest it reminds me of early jackie chan movies admittedly ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining
<START> this is an interesting true story of archie grey owl who dreamed of being an indiain when he was a child until the age of 17 he was born in england then moved to canada where he was adotped by indiains and he writes collums in magazines and he wrote a book that caugt the attention of millions the book was of his life but at the end he told his wife that he was not a real indiain and she was fine with it and he died at the age of 43 two years after he went back into the wildness
<START> i am an avid fan of horrendous movies anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game so imagine my spirit i went to the local rent shop and found vampires vs zombies the name is just too entertaining you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it it just has to be bad br br and boy is it bad after viewing this horror ific movie i was speechless literally me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie i broke the depressing silence with the words dude what yes i am an enthralling individual br br heres a quick 'street review' the plot there is none at all ever constantly in wtf mode the characters no development forgettable the music worse than porn the vampires theirs vampires the zombies theirs zombies br br in the end everyone should see this movie honestly its so bad i yearn to see it again so do yourself a favor watch it and get depressed
<START> it's sort of crazy but i taped from tcm both this german version of mgm's anna christie and the english one but i got to see this one first 'cos i'd heard that many people thought it was better than the english version br br without having seen the other one i cannot compare them but anyway this is an excellent early talkie with a straight from the heart performance by garbo she looks very beautiful in this film her face shines throughout especially when cameraman william daniels gets those gorgeous close ups of her br br the atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular mgm stuff made on that era it looks very similar to french or german expressionistic films from the thirties well it was directed by a great french director monsieur jacques feyder who had directed garbo in 1929 in the kiss br br theo shall is excellent and gives an absolutelly believable performance as anna's sweetheart the hard boiled tough sailor who's just a kid in man's body also hans junkermann gives a very fine performance as anna's alcoholic father and salka viertel too as a good hearted old cheap floozie br br in all quite an experience because it's the only film were you can listen to garbo speak in a foreign language 'cos all the other films she did in either sweden or germany were during the silent era br br serious flick
<START> power play starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part beyond bell power play has no redeeming value or interest power play has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play it's awful simply awful br br bottom line if power play was made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor b class movie the fact that power play was made in 2001 is really sad is there such a thing as a d class movie if so power play casts the mold
<START> i liked boyle's performance but that's about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9 year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stone hearted cop or an ultra evil villain the raspy voice overs seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story that's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges' stories so good is his minimalism they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i wasted 4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake
<START> this movie is awesome if you take it too seriously of course you will hate it however it's quantity of dudes and right ons brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor bill and ted's excellent adventure 1989 if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes and totally mature humor don't watch it however if you want a film that is humorous and silly yet intelligent and engaging you will enjoy it i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today's theatres and hey it's keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting right doesn't get much better than that
<START> this hard hitting often violent western in the peckinpah leone tradition is surprisingly directed by andrew v mclaglen whose previous westerns particularly those that starred john wayne were mainly in the john ford mode it is both surprisingly traditional good guys bad guys and incredible up to date as well br br heston portrays a former captain of the arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reform minded sheriff michael parks and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos telegraphs telephones and the railroad in the first years of the 20th century but soon he is confronted with a menace from his past a half breed outlaw coburn that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards in a subsequent shootout coburn's wife was killed and so coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge it involves the kidnapping and eventually the rape of heston's daughter hershey by him and his gang the result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern arizona br br the last hard men based on brian garfield's novel gun down is violent in many places including the showdown between heston and coburn and the rape scene involving hershey and two members of coburn's gang quade paull is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in straw dogs and deliverance but that doesn't detract too terribly much from the film's psychological approach to the western genre mclaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache and heston's performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films coburn makes for an especially cold blooded heavy and both parks and chris mitchum as hershey's intended husband do good turns as well the music here is cribbed from jerry goldsmith's scores to 100 rifles and the 1966 remake of stagecoach but it still works here br br wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern arizona and utilizing the old tucson set the last hard men needs to be released by fox on vhs and or dvd soon it is a western that deserves nothing less
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets it's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4 that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing br br my rating was an 8
<START> beautiful story of wisconsin native dan jansen and his real life agonizing struggle to win the 1994 olympic gold medal in speed skating despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved best friend and family member his sister jane br br this story's main focus is to sensitively portray the real life emotional turmoil of grief that one feels in loosing a special loved one and the struggle to productively cope and rise above the great loss it is the incredible story of dan jansen's heartbreak in loosing his beloved sister to leukemia his struggle to cope with the intensity of his grief while still maintaining his dream to win at the olympics and his ultimate triumph in winning the gold medal in speed skating for america and in honor of his sister's memory thereby fulfilling his childhood promise to jane br br after dan jansen's remarkable gold medal performance in the winter olympic in lillihamer norway he established a foundation in 1994 to help fight leukemia which claimed the life of his sister and to support youth sports programs educational and scholarship awards his dan jansen foundation promotes the philosophy that as his father always told him at a young age 'there is more to life than skating around in circles ' maintaining a proper perspective is key so too is setting goals and realizing one's dreams through perseverence overcoming adversity and never giving up br br recommended for anyone who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special and dearly loved within your life and for anyone who still believes in the achievement of dreams and never giving up
<START> i don't know much about tobe hooper or why he gets his name in the title but maybe he shouldn't have bothered as another commenter mentioned there isn't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre the plot is incoherent the sade sequences are gratuitous and most of the acting is so so englund was doing his best with weak material and zoe trilling has a really great bottom but neither is enough to carry this film this one's a tape over grade f
