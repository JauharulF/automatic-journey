<START> old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one the man in the grey flannel robe most bible based movies are basically schlock what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him as a great romance it falls flat as unleavened bread but there is something gripping about this movie of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god billy sunday's thesis is duking it out with h l mencken's antithesis all through the script who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus backed synthesis depends on your point of view other than that d b boasts a good performances by peck especially in the closing repentance scene and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol vivid moody atmosphere good idea to set most action at dawn or night and the rousing rendition of the twenty third psalm at the end
<START> it probably isn't fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh well br br from a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life tony soprano while a mob capo and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism it definitely brings out a sort nosey side in each and every viewer and i include myself in this br br while some above don't care for bracco i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever she is simply put his savior not speaking in religious tones br br but the knockout performance here is without doubt edie falco to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series oz and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress something only actresses like merle streep can get away with a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles but as i have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor fail br br livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself she is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself br br all in all the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series it was what brought the larry sanders show sex and the city dream on and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them too much space in between seasons and very sporadic until then i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled
<START> a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza's mgm contract at the time br br as reported by member lastliberal above grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera in addition his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable after doing their second and last film together toast of new orleans the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b mayer's office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again Â period mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza so grayson's statement stuck grayson went on to star in a number of widely received and far more profitable musicals with howard keel and others later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences
<START> monster he was great i loved the special effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of the creature from the black lagoon the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw dropping br br social commentary much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors under orders from the government state that sars like disease is out there in a nutshell we get the familiar government cover up story you know i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt but it looks like the koreans are copying the format and it's very tedious in here it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this monster it just drags the film down the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family presumed dead was hauled off by the creature br br moral a typical don't pollute the water message because this is what can happen a horrible mutated monster this used to be the anti nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants spiders fish or whatever in those schlocky sci fi films now its environmental issues that are the focus br br the humor this was mostly stupid i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny i don't know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful or the film was purposely trying to be ultra corny with a take on the old godzilla movies let's hope it's the latter br br transfer the video transfer was good this was a sharp looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear speaker crowd noise i watched this in korean with the english subtitles that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour br br overall this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots which is inexcusable for a modern day monster film two hours was way too long for this story how this film drew record crowds in korea i don't know they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support
<START> this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film pota isn't a bad film great sets costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any off the shelf hollywood director the pacing was very odd the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth was excellent probably the only pleasure in the film come back tim
<START> great little thriller i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such foolishness here yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too the only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn't panic she thinks what she can do to stall time any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots but not this one it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast thankfuly none of them were used the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her was craven should do more of these types of movies also one last comment brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was i had to come over here to see that he is lisa's father he is completely unrecognizable
<START> leonard maltin compared this film to a mel brooks comedy he was far too kind to ms rivers and far too cruel to mr brooks not even the raunchiest mel brooks films are this tasteless and at least they're genuinely funny this picture deserves a place on the hundred worst list
<START> if the movies are to be believed chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts the storylines of the three 'chinese ghost' films are largely identical but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem as always humour is an integral part of the film accompanied of course by a great deal of mugging for those who haven't encountered the 'chinese ghoststory' trilogy yet this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror ghost genre for those who have another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world
<START> alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test i won't mince words this movie was bad the story was bad the acting was bad the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad the answer is of course that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie otherwise stay home don't waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich
<START> the film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country u s we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film befittingly the obvious of student v s teacher is present but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v s female white v s black and the individual v s society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v s himself br br i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides it did not attempt to show how either was right although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end the film also discusses sex and rape it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for a time lawrence fishburne does an over the top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down trodden with the industrious and positive other stars that make this film are omar epps ice cube and jennifer connelly michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act br br higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper in fact i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university it is a life learning process not a textual one i think you'll find higher learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general 8 10
<START> the dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after 10 br br i used to work for a marine park in the florida keys one day the script for ghosts can't do it was circulating among the trainers in the fish house where food was prepared for the dolphins there was one scene where a dolphin supposedly propositions bo or bo the dolphin asking to go make eggs reading the script we lauuughed br br we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility although our dolphins were in the big blue br br this must have been very close to the end of anthony quinn's life i hope he had fun in this film as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy
<START> unbelievably awful film i watched part of this on t v recently my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind numbing drivel not a single line from the master of one liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield's body slap him around and scream how could you i know many films are done in haste hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme but please hollywood show a little respect for your audience it's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe the bottom of the cesspool even by sunday afternoon television standards
<START> now all the kids and teenagers of springwood ohio are all dead expect for one teenager shon greenblatt is still alive freddy robert englund is letting him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a memory when he's arriving in a new town when a tough female psychologist lisa zane tries to break though the new patient she's finds out where he's from she brings him along to springwood to spark some memories but three teens lezlie deane breckin meyer and ricky dean logan who unexpected came for the ride once they arrived in springwood the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child while freddy knows the true secret of her true identity br br directed by rachel talalay ghost in the machine tank girl made a grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and funny moments for this horror fantasy thriller yaphet kotto alien has a supporting role as a psychologist expert on dreams this has some ingenious visual effects not everyone will love the climax especially in 3 d and some good style in its storytelling this one did out gross some of the film's series at the box office br br dvd has an strong anamorphic widescreen 1 85 1 transfer also in pan scan and an strong dolby digital 5 1 surround sound dvd has the original theatrical trailer jump to a nightmare opinion and cast crew information the elm street series box set the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast crew of this sixth film the sixth film is also in 3 d for the film climax but you could watch it at 2 d also this is the last of the elm street films until wes craven resurrected freddy into a different darker style in new nightmare and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin off horror film freddy vs jason watch for robert shaye co owner and co ceo of new line cinema roseanne barr tom arnold johnny depp and alice cooper in amusing cameos written by michael de luca john carpenter's in the mouth of madness from a story by the director Â½
<START> halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful creepy and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators such as jason vorhees friday the 13th the miner my bloody valentine and charlie puckett the night brings charlie okay so i got a little obscure there but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre no longer did a monster have to come from king tut's tomb or from dr frankenstein's lab he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia and on the night he came home haddonfield illinois and the viewers would never be the same there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies first is the setting it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe but if trouble starts to brew nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved especially when a heavy breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine along with the setting the movie takes place on halloween the scariest night of the year while most people are carving jack o lanterns michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie boppers besides the setting there is some great acting jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine laurie strode a goody two shoes high schooler who can never seem to find a date however it is donald pleasance as dr sam loomis who really steals the show his portrayal of the good doctor who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all is the stuff of horror legend however it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film once you hear it you will never forget it i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture nowadays they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of in halloween john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers he always seems like he is a part of the shadows and i think that is what makes him so terrifying there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens unbeknownst to them which adds to his creepiness if you think about some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it unfortunately for our teenagers and fortunately for us horror fans when they find michael he's not looking for candy on this halloween night he's looking for blood finally michael myers himself is a key element to this movie's effectiveness his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life so if you have not seen this movie if there are still some of you out there who haven't or even if you have grab some popcorn turn off every light pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright trick or treat
<START> at the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 of imdb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 i can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members br br they say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters those monkeys just by random proddings at the keyboard would eventually type out the complete works of shakespeare however i seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10 br br i patiently watched the first half foolishly assuming that the film would on some level develop either the plot or the characters or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought failing that i was quite prepared to accept action suspense comedy horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention ultimately i was disappointed and consequently much of the second half was viewed at double speed as i searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption sadly there was none br br if the choke was put up against an episode of scooby doo then i'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery intrigue and unpredictability and speaking of cartoon characters the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable at best and embarrassingly poor with brooke bailey's portrayal of the freaky death obsessed pseudo goth london being so bad i almost felt sorry for her br br i would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock failed even to entertain let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick
<START> i love jane austen's stories i've only read two of them p p and s s but after having seen this adaption i'm reaching for persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because i refusing to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense for me i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel you can't really go wrong it will turn out great pretty much by default i was wrong br br first of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like you have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver sure i wanted anne and wentworth to get together but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together instead i had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the tv and to continue watching it to the end br br anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end i really have no idea why wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to she was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else's instructions rather than having a mind of her own this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wasn't done well br br the other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which mary was the worst with a full blown narcissistic personality disorder where mrs bennet in p p had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas mary was more of a freak show more loathsome than funny br br wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy for the most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he's in love with anne as surely he's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive acting wise not too much to say as i reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good bad the people acting were anthony head was excellent but as soon as i saw he was in it i expected no less br br also found the story very confusing it wasn't until the end of the movie where it seemed as if elizabeth was not anne's stepmother but in fact a sister i'm still not 100 on that the whole anne wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy they had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it how come i was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone but it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant how can it be unimportant when it's the very core of the story there was also a lot of name dropping but no real feel for who the characters were this louisa person for instance who was she a friend family what it wasn't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another lady russell was there a lot but why mrs croft and wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as mrs croft looked old enough to be his mother br br the final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but i didn't really think about it because i was too busy yelling get on with it already at the tv because anne's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met wentworth's have some hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minute br br then there's the issue of camera work as a regular movie watcher you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it i didn't decide to do so here but i still noticed them to me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job a lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made in this adaption it was over used and therefore lacked meaning the hand held feeling on occasion also didn't really work in a period drama the camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary not to mention the running itself this was the only austen adaption i caught in itv's austen season makes me wonder if it's worth watching northanger abbey and mansfield park or if i should just read the books and leave it at that i'm sad to say this is a jane austen adaption i did not enjoy maybe i'll watch the 1995 version instead the bbc are renowned for having done beautiful austen adaptations before after all
<START> following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to out stink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie career's decline where attack force was a hodge podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a high tech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs seagal has to get the plane back it's that simple no annoying sub plots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works that's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though it's pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for example br br in filmic terms fof is bad it's badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost he's just got the look of a toddler who's been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so un ambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studio's multi picture deal the producers can't be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a 12 or so million dollar budget and after seagal's obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining 7 million then i'm elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that's already got distribution sorted before it's made fan's though may argue he at least owes them the effort he's seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dub overs is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team there's nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again there's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we don't want to see br br overall the action isn't too bad it's nice and violent and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and re appears after with little explanation there's far too much stock footage used using stock shots isn't an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is we're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changing br br the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but that's not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence
<START> a disappointing film br br the story established our protagonist as chrissy a 'young' rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it's a pity though chrissy seem like interesting character br br story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahori's breaking ground with compelling cinematically told stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hours br br technically a disgusting shot film
<START> i recently found this movie on vhs after looking for it for a number of years i was not disappointed it gets better every time i see it peter ustinov stars and co wrote the original screenplay nominated for an academy award other stars you've heard of include karl malden bob newhart and cesar romero ustinov plays an accountant embezzler just released from england's infamous wormwood scrubs prison he had embezzled from the conservative party headquarters selected because he is a liberal he immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle and discovers that computers are the wave of the future he social engineers his way into a london men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town he steals the identity of one caesar smith who has just left town for south america to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild he talks his way into ta can co an american conglomerate headed by carlton klemper karl malden klemper hires smith and shows him around the computer center especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells him disconnect blue light using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies the scheme starts to unravel when klemper's assistant willard g gnatpole bob newhart notices the amount of business ta can co appears to be transacting with ustinov's scam companies with the help of his secretary patty terwilliger maggie smith ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after to tell you how would spoil this very funny romantic intelligent and ahead of its time picture
<START> it is a good film for kids who love dogs it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil the basic plot is the same as the first movie the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog the bird talks like a human eric idle of monty python and barks like a dog it is the comedy that the film needed more of see it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney
