<START> okay note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd collections i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative but Â have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role tower of london the strange door the invisible ray however is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it's actually boris karloff who overshadows bela this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead bela lugosi's character is quite possibly the most good natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here the invisible ray features three main chapters the first one set in dr janos rukh's carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film dr rukh karloff demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues among them bela lugosi as dr benet how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self manufactured device the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa there dr rukh isolates himself from the group discovers the essential element radium x to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting statues and a surprising climax karloff glows in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch the narrative structure of the invisible ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining the story is rather far fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing boris
<START> wow this movie sucked big time i heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well and with all the internet hype on this movie i figured what could go wrong however the movie was just plain bad it was boring and the character development was never there space travelers was also a horrible movie if you didn't like that movie there is no way you will like this
<START> okay so i have come a long way from houston by now but whenever i see this movie i am taken back to a little cowgirl's dream to one day ride the bull at gilley's it burned down before i was of drinking age br br if you grew up in in east texas then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time if you didn't then trust me and watch the movie either you will join the many who love it and at the same time strangely repulsed or at the very least you can make fun of the red necks there is plenty material for poking fun this movie doesn't try to be p c what was that in the 80's or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and place br br gotta be a 10 for me
<START> i see a lot of people liked this movie to me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class from the time lindsey price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable i kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere br br first we have the widowed young father clichÃ© 1 movies tv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children starting from from my 3 sons to 2 1 2 dads these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv shows br br clichÃ© 2 when a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie and will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead br br clichÃ© 3 if the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of latino origin and they must be illegal apparently there are no legal latino's and illegal europeans unless if there is a ira element involved br br clichÃ© 4 the said latino must be highly educated in his native country in this case he was a profesor who made 200 per month and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasn't brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over br br clichÃ© 5 the crime the person committed really wasn't a crime but a accident but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick br br clichÃ© 6 one never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime but some poor little cute kid this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents br br clichÃ© 7 name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force sev7n and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold br br clichÃ© 8 let's go and round up some unemployed soap stars now i like lindsey price but susan haskell imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth it use to get me sea sick she might be anchored on land better now but she still cannot act br br the movie might have been more insightful if it wasn't filled with clichÃ©s i don't think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good but this was just bad br br spoiler now i am not going to spoil the ending oh heck i will because i feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie it involves clichÃ© 6 and 7 unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran who all of a sudden is very upset you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake when she didn't now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him guess what happen to her times up she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father come on you all knew that was going to happen because she is a replacement child that is why she did not go and live with the lindey price character br br this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the clichÃ© ridden one the 2 stars are for 2 of the stars the little girl who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
<START> this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one donÂ´t miss true crimes or the hurricane my wife and me gave 8 10
<START> a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something br br i went to see this movie because it was about non wwf wrestling and so i thought it might be funny it wasn't it is excruciating to watch embarrassing any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered br br i admit i don't like jack black anyway after this i have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed the only thing i can come up with where he was o k was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in 'high fidelity' jack black is one of those awful relentless flat out ham it up knockabout guys like the little fat one in abbot costello or jerry lewis who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny br br it is not even slapstick it's just irritating it's not even stoopid it's just stupid br br i heard good things about napoleon dynamite too but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out to find it on dvd
<START> this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhys davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before mentioned crouching tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else
<START> the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country movies like these only make those beliefs stronger such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad agreed there are poor and homeless in india but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones br br i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society exactly the reason why people ask me when we go to india can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes br br those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch monsoon wedding
<START> although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb br br yaara studying at princeton returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend talia because yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother she has lost her adoptive sister and because yaara blind from birth has been guided and guarded by talia her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable br br inevitably the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death though without sight she has insight though she cannot see she is able to find what is out of sight than the normal people around her the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia in her adoptive family's house in tapes diaries and people in talia's past and present br br told from yara's point of view the film is also seen from her point of view as she visualizes what she hears believes and imagines the solution to the mystery is rather conventional but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare that the pat moment is easily forgiven the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably clarifying not only talia's life but also her relationship with yaara tali sharon as yaara uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more confidently br br noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious the dead on acting by the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager i will quibble with yaara's final declaration as stands with gadi talia's last boyfriend at a cliff's edge but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled
<START> i'm not quite sure if the term serious comedy applies to this movie im not even sure if this can be applied on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin therefore i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as serious comedies br br does the 40 year old virgin fit into this guild that is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie you get to laugh a lot plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations br br i'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie especially men br br the story as the title says it is about andy a shy silent guy whom collects action figures watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asia br br kal is andy's co worker at smarttech he believes andy to be a psychopath until andy's secret is revealed kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre br br david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex girlfriend whom ran away with another guy and jay a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts br br i'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it so in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh with social commentary than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films br br it also includes dvd bonuses which you'll really see from top to bottom
<START> i gather at least a few people watched it on sept 2 on tcm if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u s it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u s was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible i watched because i had just seen a documentary on bad women actresses in the u s pre movie censorship board set up in the early '30s it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedy's most sensational shots in ecstasy in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this by today's standards and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty it was a nice lyrical movie to relax to i loved it for what it was a simple romance i watched it after pre recording it during a sleepless early a m i would love to see the first version released in the u s for comparison's sake
<START> although this movie has some weaknesses it is worth seeing i chose it because of the cast and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past both portray very troubled people complete with warts but make them likeable because of their humanity the story is touching but it is the performances that soar bonham carter's jane is a remarkable achievement whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before but was interesting as well for other reasons i felt the movie ended too abruptly but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending see stepmom the very real english setting added to my enjoyment it was england in the 90's both urban and rural without being depressing
<START> a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy elvis presley plays an indian bull riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert spread in arizona where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle which is in dire need of a stud what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages his social commentary isn't exactly pointed but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell the general wackiness gets way out of hand and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest as for elvis he's loose and frisky throughout and while it's nice to see him having fun on screen one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point this shambles of a picture has a distinct what the hell feel to it and though spirits are high the returns are mostly low 1 2 from
<START> the magnetism radiated from elvira drawing her legions of devoted admirers has a primordial quality with her lengthy well toned figure large bust innocuously mischievous attitude and grab bag lexicon of me generation valley slang the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one liners and large chest as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one dimensional romantic yearning boyish sexual craving and the desire for non threateningly lighthearted fun she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons in the end however her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense fortunately i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer br br best quote bob redding how's your head elvira i haven't had any complaints
<START> this is one of the most putrid movies of the 90's i would not recommend it if you have something better to do br br this picture presents african americans as savage uncultured violent inarticulate reefer smoking sociopaths fudge ice cube and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm not just the white people but asians too and are never disciplined for their actions despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way in fact it is fudge's influence that causes remmy to bond with the skin heads to drop out of college and eventually to kill malik's girlfriend br br the skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police they do commit serious crime such as battery and rape yet they're not as repulsive nor as threatening as fudge and dreads busta rhymes are br br there's a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle some of it is as follows below br br fudge and dreads are stated as students at the columbus university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition one is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances though they are students at what looks like a private university they cannot utter a single line of proper english their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia br br it appears that drunken kristen kristy swanson knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin the fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy later kristen was assured by taryn jennifer connely that she holds no accountability in that matter and despite willfully jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator then a week or so later she met and slept with an ultra sensitive do gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom the director stressed contraception thoroughly br br this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail cole hauser's acting and laurence fishburne's accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it the writer director is obviously a man of limited intelligence go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want but keep in mind that neurons don't grow back just follow the advice at the end and unlearn
<START> after seeing the terrible terrible terrible batman dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about it br br pressing play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what so far looked like another bad wannabe film maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesn't exist as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes long br br world's finest makes up for batman dead end and then some br br i look forward to the next short
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were top grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> misty ayers had a smoking body and that's all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released what i learned from this movie that women's low rise panties existed in 1954 i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing except for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect
<START> this film takes what could have been a good idea a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it nora and jim are alcoholics who go to ireland to dry out they go to stay with her nan and uncle the uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat he revives her and she takes the form of nora she cannot be killed conventionally more is the pity nora however works out a way to do so br br this is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap it is a sprawling mess i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear br br avoid at all costs
<START> you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it that would be a mistake this is one of the most pointless films ever made i kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it its a wonder that it was ever put on video br br i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of anyone's time watching it surely there are high school students who would be able to write produce a film which as a plot
