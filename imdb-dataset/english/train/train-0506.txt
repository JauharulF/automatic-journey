<START> it's hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star spangled banner i had to turn the sound off then i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search i've always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars
<START> i'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private however pushing daisies is my exception i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show i was skeptical about it at first especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head here we go again i thought i watched the first second third and all the other episodes wow first of all i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life chuck without the consequences of her dying br br most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have besides ned and chuck olive longs for ned lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve i think the characters are picture perfect and believable i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him br br all in all this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i've seen out of the 2007 season i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who done it for the mystery buffs i just wish the writers would get back to work so that the show can continue to evolve
<START> yep the topic is a straight quote from the movie and i think it's pretty accurate i was so bored to dead with this pointless effort all the flashes etc making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making if you are epileptic you would have died at least five times already of course all the david lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it doesn't make any sense and when it doesn't make any sense it's got to be art and art movie is always good right i say wrong this kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you're a good film maker anthony hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting
<START> excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction 7 days 7 suicides it doesnt get more depressing than this movie rating 8 10 music rating 10 10
<START> given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness 81 minutes including end credits so roughly 76 minutes of actual film but what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed br br the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spots james woods' portrayal of max van sydow's character in the exorcist and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film very unfunny was the take off of charlie's angels which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it br br today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the exorcist and maybe of the 80s' poltergeist et al br br hopefully scary movie 3 will take some time to put together making the spoofs more enjoyable br br one thing though the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna faris whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel just for her casting and acting ability i give this movie a 3 out of 10
<START> i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film i've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people i can't really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it br br the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it br br although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch
<START> i watched the presentation of this on pbs in the u s when it originally aired in 1988 assuming the miniseries was available on dvd i purchased first editions of all three books last year since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites today i found this web site i will give up the search br br i too would like to buy this complete 26 episodes miniseries after buying the dvds i would read each book then watch the episodes for that book that is what i did with john lecarre's karla trilogy and larry mcmurty's texas ranger trilogy br br does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good tv miniseries or movie series that are now available on dvd
<START> this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers don't get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
<START> had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise prisoners finding magic book oo err claustrophobic terror ensues etc br br but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea rather than chilling physcological horror it relied on effects out in the open fire and ott body horror which didn't scare at all if your over 12 br br the logic at the end is ridiculous with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount waste of good characters which were the best thing about this film br br obviously low budget which doesn't spoil it the film really goes nowhere and icant believe im going to say this it needs a hollywood remake you simply loose interest in this version definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchable entertaining malefique isn't watchable to the end to be honest and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film really really disappointing impossible to recommend
<START> this is a run of the mill nature porn movie by porn i don't mean sex i mean gratuitous images of for example thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film br br there is almost no plot in this film told to expect a story of three animal families better than march of the penguins the movie simply doesn't deliver the blame rests in three key areas 1 the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history 2 the music team who over dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly 3 the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film a film about life when we got to the whales halfway through the film i sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that i'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen br br there was also almost no science in the film at all they attributed hot and cold all of it not just the seasons solely to the earth's tilt ignoring the fact that we'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm and it would be worst if we had no rotation relative to revolution like mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature so much for science br br i must credit the camera work however and again that is why i call this nature porn everything from super slow motion to what appears to be a finely tuned mechanically controlled time lapse photography was put to use to provide some and i caution only some stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films that said i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural but they didn't do that br br for a film about earth i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown what we saw was pristine we had to take the narrator's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes they didn't show us evidence of it they didn't show us alberta's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space they didn't show us the great pacific trash whorl they didn't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet these are as much earth as anything else why cover it up for a feel good whitewash br br my last criticism of the content is of predation any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimate evil character but predators aren't evil they perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive we are predators ourselves any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don't really happen the final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat bad bear bad you can almost hear them say br br on to the presentation itself my theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home but the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 16 9 ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days and during one action packed scene near the end the film i can't imagine this happening digitally from how it looked was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely that repeated about three times br br if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it but how will i know
<START> and how it made it into production astounds me the main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny i can't stand the character at all he's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show br br this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years no joke the story lines are both poorly written and executed the jokes are as bad as the ones on disney's sweet life of zack and cody i could not dislike this show more it's terrible and should be canceled even the theme song is bad the title even worse br br it's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor br br johnny test go away far and fast
<START> i saw this pilot when it was first shown and i'm sure countless spirit fans hate it because like batman the green hornet etc it took the character in the direction of camp but i evidently never got enough of batman because i thought it was entertaining in some of the same ways as that show there are two parts that stay with me first when denny's partner has been fatally wounded and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and obeying the exact letter of it then he says something like boy was i stupid which is his way of telling denny to become a vigilante instead which he does though the tv batman kind then there's the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her but she isn't fooled because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly this was a great example of camp that was also underplayed by both the actor and actress
<START> thieves and liars presents us with a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto ricans and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their loved ones' lives the cast is excellent considering that some are non professional actors an excellent choice that augments the level of reality in the film the photography propels the story without intrusion as it should be in this type of film the script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the boricuas in a very deep way sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary watching this film you feel as if you've secretly entered the real puerto rican society and stand invisibly watching it implode i loved it
<START> may contain spoilers may contain spoilers br br in the age of shrek the movie pixar the studio this is a much more traditional animation film it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together not to mentioned try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father they begin as enemies and end as best friend if this sound like a disney film it is only made through 20th century fox the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film yes there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min their children's attention is focused on something else than them the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film children will love this film adults will only like it
<START> 'iedereen beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie it's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star the only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail the problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made everything is supposed to be funny but it isn't it is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole set up is
<START> this movie looked like it was going to be really funny i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed it was very unrealistic the plot was also pretty weak i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren't even that good i was also really disappointed with the ending i would not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet when it's retrieved one of the crew members is ill one is alive and the other two are missing what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member br br while on mars the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug eyed monsters oddly while the sets were pretty good the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film plus in an odd attempt at realism the production used a process called cinemagic unfortunately this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed it was that bad despite all the cheese the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel for lovers of the genre it's well worth seeing for others you may just find the whole thing rather silly see for yourself and decide br br while by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci fi film compared with the films being made at the time it stacks up pretty well br br ps when you watch the film pay careful attention to dr tremayne he looks like the spitting image of dr quest from the jonny quest cartoon plus he sounds and acts a lot like him too
<START> i have always liked spike lee's movies but this one was a total waste of 2 1 2 hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot i'm not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless it's a xxx movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort
<START> for a mature man to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response to a mature film br br if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that life can never be the same after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level br br
<START> i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised after suffering through saturday night foolishness i had no desire to see a re make in some south texas barnyard and i didn't john revolta was good as the jealous redneck scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex con and debra winger was as always a delight love that woman plus the soundtrack was dynamite and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music a fun film all the way
