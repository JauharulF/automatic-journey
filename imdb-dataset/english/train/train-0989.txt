<START> if there was a god he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up this is by far the worst vampire movie i have ever seen i may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie it makes zombie lake look like the sound of music
<START> an opium den a dirty little boy actually a midget prostitutes galore a violent fracas in a dive a motel for sexual shenanigans scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot a boozer falling down the stairs a racially mixed clientÃ¨le in a bar with asians africans and anglos treated equally does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall wrong these are all scenes from a 1933 musical br br the first half of footlight parade is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film chester kent cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day john wayne in the big trail before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue shorts news reels serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley could it be that cagney's character is patterned after berkeley could be br br in preparation for the prologues kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival he uncovers the traitor fires him then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress his assistant nan prescott joan blondell soon to be mrs dick powell has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain dick powell who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn ruby keeler the resulting three prologue musicals which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago honeymoon hotel by a waterfall and shanghai lil br br of special note is the song and dance of tough guy james cagney like fred astaire and bill bojangles robinson cagney's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed although hours went into practice to get each step just right not as good a singer as astaire cagney's singing like astaire's sounded natural unlike the crooning so popular at the time it's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney br br most critics prefer the shanghai lil segment over the other two yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of by a waterfall is astonishing how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must see the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color br br though not nearly as socially conscious as gold diggers of 1933 footlight parade stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen
<START> it is not un common to see u s re makes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face but here is the flip side this is an awful re make of the u s movie wide awake by the british br br wide awake is strange but entertaining and funny liam on the other hand is just strange i must give credit to liam for one thing and that is making it clear that i made the right choice in changing my religion
<START> most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good and bad sci fi movies in hollywood but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land the story is a basic femme fatale premise nothing new or enthralling verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences which instead of defining our main character and his situation are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot the screenplay was solid the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting jereone krabbe was amazing as the tortured artist and the supporters were very good as well also jan de bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director br br 6 5 10 br br 1 2
<START> i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s
<START> as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie it was the all round bollywood action comedy movie it is a imitation of bad boys obviously the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema br br the songs the songs are both funny and catchy proving laughs when you least expect it amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah' his accent body language brilliant br br 'assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song hilarious
<START> this is how i felt while watching this film i loved it it was hilarious but i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point a friend put it this way br br i feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge br br another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film groovin' gary the original beaver kid is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope of getting on film and he certainly does though not perhaps as he initially expected with high hopes of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town headlined by his own drag act olivia newton don br br director trent harris does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs over two subsequent reinterpretations into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town america the cult of celebrity and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry br br both sean penn and grispin glover pull out stunner performances a young sean penn is the most evocative so closely does he follow the actual 'gary footage' but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way harris wants it to go br br in the end the wide eyed naivety the original gary is what moved me when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation br br a film not to miss i have not seen anything else like it br br jacob
<START> i wasn't quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but as it turns out this is a pretty good show no small thanks to talented casting four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings on of their love lives the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite sharon small's trudi is the homemaker one allegedly widowed after september 11th who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors it's great to see small back on t v as she was great in the inspector lynley mysteries the chick can act orla brady's character siobhan a lawyer is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women as she wrestles with her kind but self absorbed husband hari jaffrey formerly of spooks in his driven desire to have a child with her regardless of her needs the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess shellie conn an events planner who's a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone gender not specific and katie sarah parrish a somber doctor who's affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control that being said i'm hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because it's good it's different and it's got a great cast
<START> this piece ain't really worth a comment it's simply the worst horror movie i have ever seen the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry shame on you i say
<START> kathryn bigelow and mark boal are already preparing a sequel about a young us corporal in afghanistan he also happens to be a highly qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around kabul operating on wounded nato soldiers on a particularly difficult mission he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots osama bin laden from a distance of about 3000 yards he is then finally promoted to sergeant but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career so he quits from the army altogether one year later frustrated with civilian life he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform
<START> i don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless br br what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co star gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie br br i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman he's just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too br br in short it's a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse
<START> jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's it's a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch in jacknife both lovers of european and american cinema can find things to relate on the screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters ed harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date he portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line in each move robert de niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical hollywood's typical character elements after the war none is a hero everybody is a loser and this movie is about that simple truth none can mend up his pieces after a war just like the heroes of this movie jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates simply magnificent movie
<START> when i rented unhinged i was expecting a gore movie the box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release i now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater after finishing the movie i wondered how it could even receive a video release br br the plot is as follows a group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree these women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion which contains an extremely sexist woman beyond this point the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release br br one of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting lisa munson who plays the main character looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards the others acting is bad but not nearly as bad as hers another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling this gets very annoying as the movie progresses on top of all that there is very little gore which makes the box very misleading br br don't waste your time on this one my rating 1 out of 10
<START> a pure reality bytes film fragile beautiful and amazing first film of the director represented spain on the berlinale 2002 some people has compared the grammar of the film with almodovar's films well that shouldn't be a problem
<START> as with most of eleanor powell's films this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots for some reason oh it is explained she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing but as always powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939 a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise guy persona later on in addition the great drummer buddy rich has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey's trumpet man ziggy elman i say unique perhaps in ignorance but i know of no other drum trumpet sequence like this one on film or records this film is fun even skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake no wait i mean the the whole damn bakery it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created please just do yourself a favor if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for in summation i guess you really can call it a horror movie but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story br br real rating 10 disgusting
<START> jacknife is a fine adaptation of stephen metcalfe's play 'strange snow' the screenplay was also written by metcalfe sensitively directed by david hugh jones that explores the too frequently forgotten effect of battle on veterans damaged permanently by the heinous cruelties of war it is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our veterans' hospitals br br three friends went off to the vietnam war together and only two returned alive the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one david 'highschool' flannigan ed harris is so severely damaged by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with his very plain schoolteacher sister martha kathy baker as david deteriorates his buddy joseph 'jacknife' megessey robert de niro returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend in the course of events jacknife at first offers succor to martha and eventually the two date at a prom martha must attend and at that prom drunken david completely falls apart destroying relics in the school and terrifying the townspeople and students jacknife makes dave relive the moment in vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings david to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery and the long suffering martha finds her needs tended by jacknife too br br all three actors give astonishingly fine performances ed harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while de niro and baker maintain the high standards set by their careers more people should help resurrect this all but forgotten film as it is a brittle reminder of the damages our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after battle's end highly recommended grady harp
<START> sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of if not his best it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies br br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity as the song from whom the films takes its title gershwin's well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that no one is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that bogdanovich touch based on the point of view is a class on cinema language something that p b learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of sinatra's trilogy this movie full of self consciousness and compassion and far away from self indulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed it's not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
<START> lapyuta castle in the sky more than any of hayao miyazaki's movies brings the joy of storytelling to the audience it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again it's just magical it's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states but now that it's here check it out and stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book whatever br br i give it a ten ten
<START> i don't believe they made this film completely unnecessary the first film was okay but there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film this film feels like a soap opera the writing is so bad it's utterly simple the jokes don't come across the acting is flat it's shot like a soap it lacks any direction the first film had a good emotional spine behind it every character had a little arc it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film but this time around there is no cohesive story line the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens one good thing the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleire's son is pretty well cast that was their one moment of creative success on this film i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'team spirit 2' but please god don't let them make a third feature installment
