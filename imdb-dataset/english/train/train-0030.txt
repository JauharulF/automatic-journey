<START> contains miner spoilers br br i have seen a number of decent indie horror films such as the hamiltons the boys love mandy lane and cabin fever unfortunately i felt five across the eyes does not fall into this category from start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script god only knows why the writer s thought dialogue such as no don't go out there don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead is of movie quality br br this film displays very little character development and to be honest i couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities' all they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing when they do converse the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer br br the soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven br br the camera work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable i'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie i think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through but due to a very shaky camera grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic it's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography br br i understand that five across the eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality there are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting poor scripting shoddy camera work and no story in light off all this i decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying arguing aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations however how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car
<START> i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can't help but be entertained by it gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made monsters to carry a scene the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr is suberb and very entertaining to watch the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly some might consider it corny but i consider it classic filmaking and acting at its best one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades in short its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either

<START> though the movie may have been true to lewis's book in that the script was basically word for word verbatim it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this the mythical creatures unicorns centaurs griffins ghouls ghosts are drawn in and as in the previous review the green screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's howl a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could br br all of the acting is tremendously forced especially that of little lucy penvensie i could only take so much indignation desperation and buck teeth in the what felt like fourteen hours of watching the movie the actress who plays the white witch in all her histrionics seems that she'd be more at home on stage where a booming voice spread arms and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome br br the sets feel claustrophobic whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors indoors it's as if bbc could only afford to spend 100 on constructing a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly huddled together the white witch's castle is a run down rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods actually any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles br br the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking but once it starts moving you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear end in the lion suit br br yes if you are a hardcore narnia fan you may want to see this version simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote but lewis was certainly no screenwriter and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves mrs beaver's incessant oh just one more thing dearies and then we will be ready to go punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of no mrs beaver please a scene of comic relief so incongruous they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have in fact the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these br br i would recommend seeing the new narnia disney 2005 the new movie with updated effects spectacular computer animation great timing all around and a gorgeous and scene stealing white witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a shrieking banshee captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision i think lucy is a lot cuter no buck teeth yay as are the beavers and realistically sized and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine desperately hungry for acceptance insecure and angsting with an inferiority complex edmund that the new disney version fronts br br unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> okay let's face it this is a god awful movie the plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful mario lanza movies just to hear the voice of the star in this case pavarotti in his prime okay so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing luciano that alone is worth watching the movie a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds humility and love along the way and belts out a lot of hit numbers too br br i must admit i'm prejudiced on a number of levels i'm italian i'm a big pavarotti fan is there anything about pavarotti that isn't big including his fan base and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time so as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again br br yes it's corny and awful but the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what it's all about so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone like italian food that you've never tried before try it you may be pleasantly surprised as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep
<START> riding giants is an amazing movie it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun they didn't care about money jobs girls or any thing to them the waves were their girls i have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard i don't understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it it might be a documentary but it is really good tara f
<START> this woman never stops talking throughout the movie she memorized every line and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion she also has a most uncharming lisp and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard this film has way too much betsy drake and not enough cary grant who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own
<START> this movie is the best film ever i can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting story plot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you have't this movie try it once do watch it

<START> what on earth has become of our dear ramu is this the same man who made sarkar satya and comapny i refuse to believe so if aag was ramu's most ambitious project he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times this movie is made to fall like a brick i was cringing to leave the theater but i was forced to sit because i wouldn't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left else nothing would have made me sit beyond interval br br this movie is nowhere close to sholay it doesn't even come near it within a mile i believe ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay since sarkar was a classic piece of work i read ramu's interview a couple of days back in which the interviewer said that ramu doesn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day that too not at a stretch i completely agree with this now as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie br br there is no power in the performance amitabh bachchan doesn't even look scary he looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers i saw earlier ramu's favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs in fact none if i remember clearly she opened her mouth in this movie and has found a place in history the new guy playing jai's role seems to have that brash look but didn't manage jai's role at all i cant go on im sorry my pain is too big for me to manage right now br br i promised myself throughout the movie that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see that it is still there br br bottom line horrible movie the media and critics are going to cook ramu's goose and just to remind all readers once more i am one of the biggest ramu fans and even i cant spare him for this act
<START> but cinderella gets my vote not only for the worst of disney's princess movies but for the worst movie the company made during walt's lifetime the music is genuinely pretty and the story deserves to be called classic what fails in this movie are the characters particularly the title character who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the term br br after a brief prologue the audience is introduced to cinderella she is waking up in the morning and singing a dream is a wish your heart makes this establishes her as an idealist and thus deserving of our sympathy unfortunately the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about freedom from her servant role the respect of her step family someone to talk to besides mice and birds in one song cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently you go girlfriend in short cinderella is a very bland character she passively accepts her step family's abuse escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family for this she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except of course cinderella can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat if cinderella is dull her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time we are given no indication if he is a good man if he respects cinderella or anything all we know is 1 he is a prince and 2 he dances well heck even the prince from snow white got to sing a romantic song at least not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot weakening her already tenuous appeal br br perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief cinderella's friends the mice granted these characters are amusing even so when the comic relief steals the show from the principals well let's just say your story has some problems br br dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces while many of them are there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way cinderella is a prime example of this fact
<START> this show was fabulous it was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet even jonathan cake the philandering boyfriend was likable since our airwaves are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the stars it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance it really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to some of us are not sheep this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans
<START> i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for it br br or if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the show br br i enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty sÃ nchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respect br br this is a show that has little taste or class it's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out br br now these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character
<START> warning may contain spoilers br br so who are these mystery men simply put the mystery men are a group of sub heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities the shoveller bill macy works construction during the day and at night leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel fighting style the blue raja hank azaria sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping mr furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay then takes out his frustration on his friends at night tossing ill conceived one liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry leaving everyone to wonder so what ben stiller breathes such life into this character you can't help but love him br br these three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about becoming real super heroes obviously it could happen champion city has captain amazing after all a flying fighting super cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career br br to bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again c a frees casanova frankenstein a waaaaay over the top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush this lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities and ends up capturing c a within hours of his release from prison this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein's evil plan but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein the trio are going to need a little help br br recruiting commences and after a painful recruitment party the team settles in with the bowler janeane garofolo who initially has the only real talent in the team with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father the invisible boy kel mitchell who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him the spleen paul reubens granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy and the much underused sphinx wes studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over wise br br this film really is a cross genre romp anyone wanting to pigeon hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoof parody of the superhero genre from the pseudo burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic book genre gets a pretty good send up but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of d c comic's short lived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna bes and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city you'd see a half dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis sure the shoveller fights pretty well and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy all parts of the super hero world but does that make them genuine super heroes only in their minds br br this movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super heroics one liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball father yet it isn't a comedy in the sense of side splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of it br br what really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weak lame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super heroes justice is served and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great romp br br of course no movie is perfect claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr furious' love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone and the villians are never more than gun toting lackeys a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well br br yet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest br br 8 10 in my opinion
<START> children love dinosaurs it's somewhat part of their culture but they've got the land before time the original at least that movie had heart this this movie is just plain pathetic just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children this movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and it's more by the numbers stuff not as soul sucking as theodore rex but it's lightyears away from being a land before time
<START> the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthau's nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but didn't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo's nest however in another year this was an oscar worthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns
<START> paris je t'aime is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing ask a large group of people their impressions of life in paris and the result would be something akin to this film tied together by each of the sectors or arrondissement of the city the film examines love in all forms native folk in their parisian modes and tourists interacting with the great city approximately twenty writers and directors each with about five minutes of screen time include olivier assayas the coen brothers sylvain chomet isabel coixet wes craven alfonso cuarÃ³n gÃ©rard depardieu christopher doyle vincenzo natali alexander payne walter salles nobuhiro suwa and gus van sant among others less well known the stories vary from hilarious to humorous to touching to tragic to banal to tender br br in one story a young frenchman gaspard ulliel is attracted to a young lithographer elias mcconnell pouring out his heart in french to a lad who speaks only english in another a separated husband and wife gena rowlands and ben gazzara meet in the latin quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in pÃ¨re lachaise emily mortimer and rufus sewell approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed oscar wilde intervenes steve buscemi in tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections in bastille sergio castellitto in love with mistress leonor watling is ready to divorce his wife miranda richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia juliette binouche confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in place des victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy willem defoe sara martins and nick nolte and ludivine sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in parc monceau fanny ardant and bob hoskins 'play out' a strange relationship in pigalle melchior beslon plays a young blind man to actress natalie portman in learning how to see in faubourg saint denis vampire love between elijah wood and olga kurylenko in quartier de la madeleine maggie gyllenhaal is an ex patriot actress stung out on drugs in quartier des enfants rouges and margo martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the french she has studied for her life's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14Ã¨me arrondissement br br the final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible but this only works on superficial levels the film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action but it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re visit like a scrapbook of a time in paris it is a film worth seeing multiple times grady harp
<START> before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut confessions of a dangerous mind they starred together in this movie george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with steven soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie remakes such as ocean's eleven and the italian job but somehow this movie is only halve successful or at least it isn't as good as it could had been br br the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie the fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at all br br it's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential i can only assume that the original italian movie i soliti ignoti works out much better than this movie does the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling br br nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity it's an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story in that regard welcome to collinwood is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well br br it's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing br br 7 10
<START> i loved this movie i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan but i really enjoyed myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going this is a bit of a departure for disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development my husband pointed this out and there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney be they young or old
<START> i am wanting to make a holmes with doors pun but i can't quite string it all together suitably grubby and over edited wonderland gives kilmer a role that channels morrison at the same time but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead as someone famous said once about us cinema double standards kiss a breast and it's an x stab it and its an action pg 13 wonderland is 14 minutes too long too and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema how many films called wonderland are we going to get there must be six in the last decade the pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble cam gets tiresome as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time taking a few cues form the doors and taxi driver it all becomes forgettable the next day
