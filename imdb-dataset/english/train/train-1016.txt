<START> 1 2 scarlett johansson woody allen hugh jackman ian mcshane romola garia directed by woody allen just after his work with johansson on match point the two return for scoop a corky zany and fun comic ride when a student reporter johansson finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter mcshane when she enters the materializer of a lame magician allen the scoop being of the new tarot card killer in london who might be preppy peter lyman jackman while sondra and sid are playing detective sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer allen has finally hit a mark not as good as match point but definitely more fun i laughed a lot more than i expected one of the years must sees
<START> fantastically putrid i don't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid doc savage almost every demographic group would be bored by this trivial tv movie quality production it's a little like the 60's batman tv series except it's not funny even accidentally you're better off taking a nap
<START> the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and un factual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by today's standards br br transfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good Â just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balanced br br extras forget it it's universal bottom line as pseudo history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt Â in some cases Â a whole box seems more appropriate
<START> i know anime i've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was and just so you know i'm not bragging about my let me say this out of all the animes i've seen castle in the sky is by far one of the best it's obvious people say spirited away is the best but i really disagree most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award this isn't an exaggeration i've shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people who'd only ever seen spirited away and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three personally i'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke until i finally saw castle in the sky i still think that the prior is the better of the two but castle in the sky is easily on par with it in many ways castle has major elements that mononoke was missing in either case if you've only seen spirited away and think that that is miyazaki's best film be prepared to have your earth shaken
<START> full disclosure i'm a cynic i like my endings sad and my hankies dry i didn't cry when bambi's mother was shot will smith's new film happiness looks like a desperate plea for an oscar basically i was born without an artistic soul br br so why on earth did i like 10 items or less maybe it was the double espresso i downed before the show or more likely maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness br br and sweet it is from the moment him meets scarlet an event far from a nora ephron meet cute the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed aided beautifully by phedon papamichael's cinema verity style camera work br br the main argument about the film is that it's too far fetched is the film far fetched i don't know you tell me i've yet to meet adrian brody at the market however not for lack of trying do i enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this momentous event take place darn straight i do that's where most reviews of 10 items or less fall short they fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies and heck sometimes it's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them 82 minutes at a time
<START> it's like a bad 80s tv show got loose and tried to become a soft core porn movie oh my god was it bad the plots of each character had little relevance the plot itself wasn't anything to speak of something about a stalker i guess in the end he shoots himself it's not really clear but somehow there's a volleyball game involved and the main character randy sleeps around a lot the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van dien was in it and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it which were barely watchable at that thank god i didn't spend any money on it but i want that hour of my life back
<START> the perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do this would not be a family film if they all died then it will all be sad you don't want that kate capsaw the leading lady gives a golden globe performance but sadly she nor lea thompson won one that sucks so bad i can't say it enough this film is so great lea thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure br br sorry but better than star wars star wars is so over rated and space camp was so under rated it should of been the other way around br br excellent 10 10 0r maybe 11 10 iam not good at math
<START> think of this film as a saturday morning live action program from ages ago even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warrior wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie mst3k here's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season
<START> this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year it's still a competent thriller the machine carried on without him perfectly but Â something was missing dix the stories in the whistler series were always interesting sometimes brilliant the screenplays often noir always atmospheric but it wasn't only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen dix did too br br young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad is the potential groom put off even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams or is love blind who's twisting who is the question michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp lovely lenore aubert's finest moments came next film in abbott costello meet frankenstein and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice br br a lot happened in this last hour well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well
<START> i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i can't really recommend this movie the characters aren't really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didn't finish the movie i'd skip this one
<START> production line collection of fart jokes that pretends 'babe' was never made the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going it's not eddie murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the incessant and witless chatter of guinea pigs tigers rats dogs and pigeons the voice cast is impressive albert brooks julie kavner reni santoni john leguizamo garry shandling ellen degeneres paul reubens brian doyle murray but the script is so unimaginative charmless and depressingly unfunny that the whole thing rattles down the bin chute pretty quickly
<START> marjorie a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist joe superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo however joe steals her wallet and finds out where marjorie lives he pays her a visit one fateful day after subjecting marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse marjorie manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the fireplace what is marjorie going to do with joe director robert m young and screenwriter william mastrosimone concoct a harsh gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity joe perceives women strictly as objects while marjorie only sees joe as an animal however this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one dimensional creep instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads they receive fine support from diana scarwid as the passive terry alfre woodard as the sensible patricia and sandy martin as sympathetic policewoman officer sudow both curtis clark's agile cinematography and j a c redford's shivery skin crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension a real powerhouse
<START> what the hell was all that about i saw the matrix and was amazed it was the most spectacular movie ever made what ever possesed the wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me br br there is no plot you can't argue with that basically all this film was was a load of talking and don't get me wrong i have no problem with talky films but all the talking in the matrix reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle then there would be a fight sequence which lasted way too long then more pointless drivvle then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti climax ever a little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes br br also keanu reeves gives his worst performance yet i knew he wasn't a good actor but this was beyond a joke if you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along god knows what his performance is like in something's gotta give keanu reeves the only plank of wood ever to become an actor br br after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment if you haven't already seen the first film i suggest you watch it but don't waste your time with this utter pile of turd br br
<START> i wasn't sure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three br br admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment br br where this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i haven't encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce br br the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years
<START> 'loulou' delights in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine aftertaste br br 'loulou's theme isn't new the film doesn't carry an original plot either its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind br br whatever one further may say about 'loulou' it's beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make friends br br for those around at the time 'loulou' also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of 1980
<START> i have yet to read shirley jackson's novel something of which i've been meaning to do for quite sometime i am sure it has got to be scarier than this film i remember jumping once when i watched it the other day although i cannot recall the scene br br the special effects are great and i watched this on dvd but i am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight after the first few special effects are done with i was waiting for a story to develop br br i figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel so a good story should be there but it wasn't i was relegated to staring at the gorgeous catherine zeta jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch lili talor was such a suck character i did not like her one bit something about whiny people also the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish dudley doright with his voice and face i could not relate to the characters at all quigon ahem liam neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting br br half to three quarters of the way i was just dying to go see a campy friday the 13th or a scream queenish film at least there is some type of entertainment value if there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females this had nothing br br
<START> gritty dusty western from director richard brooks who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichÃ©s intact early 1900s horse race attracts a low keyed cowboy gene hackman a suave gambler james coburn a cocky kid jan michael vincent and even a female a surprisingly game candice bergen once the preliminaries are out of the way with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era good looking if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly from
<START> i went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of hat totally not knowing what to expect and it turn out into a very enjoyable die laughing experience it's an excellent movie with very unexpected story very good dialogs and crazy humor all characters are obviously made in alan ford italian satiric comic style but that haven't bothered me for a second in fact this kind of loser bums line up made a movie quite unique and interesting sam rockwell gave very good and convincing role willian macy too clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant but real star is actually guzman he made a role of his life in this movie the scene when his character cosimo dies in the movie is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him highly recommended for all alan ford fans
<START> 60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she's brought to at the beginning of the movie is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black gloved killer or supernatural evil no she's running from a bunch of bullies for the other 40 minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught which doesn't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteries unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesn't quite know how to do it we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f cking wrong here man when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students he does so with quick cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched this is shocking music blares in the background none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here it's all a bit clumsy and aimless with no real sense of urgency or direction a number of people are presented as suspects but there's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie i like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child
<START> don't even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel it's too terrible for words the movie that is not the bronchitis the acting is deplorable richard grieco hams it up as a trigger happy gun slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal peppered with clichÃ©d lines are you ready pardner purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims dire avoid
