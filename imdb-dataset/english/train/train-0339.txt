<START> the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams' ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars br br i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams' friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10
<START> this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original it's directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george make up effects artist for the film his effects are so off the wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get the movie isn't really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty eyeball munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot what mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo 4th installment my favorite of all 5 you'll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy
<START> it's been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy and i'd forgotten just how idiotic it is i'd place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presley's very worst movies presley plays joe whitecloud a half breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken down shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez none of the three offer anything of substance comically or otherwise the government has invested in the family's cattle but they're lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boy crazy gal and her gun toting mother this is just a real slapdash of a mess and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don't make this much easier the one thing that puzzles me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies
<START> this movie is just truly awful the eye candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie br br the writer director producer lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage family acceptance religion homophobia hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes br br the script is poor the casting very ordinary but the dialogue and acting is just woeful the homo hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors i think i've seen more passion in an corn flakes ad the acting is stiff and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight br br i'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution and if he is thinking of doing so i have some advise just don't do it
<START> avoid this crap at all costs bad script bad directing bad acting bad editing bad sound and bad music get the idea this movie tries to be western flavored it's not it tries to be hard core violent it's not it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre it doesn't the actors try there best and my heart goes out to them but with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine to me this has all of the looks of a fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire first attempt freshmen film makers often bite off more that they or their budget can chew the best thing they can do is to take a few steps back reassess what is possible and work within their limited budget the next time out
<START> felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don't celebrate holidays the sad part is that non witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained which would you prefer to treat your loved ones i highly recommend this video
<START> i rented this tape a couple of years ago and boy did it suck from the commercials i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women and that was where the comedy would lie boy was i wrong the jokes were vulgar and they were just not funny don't bother 1 10
<START> a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process frustrated and drunk with power he turns psychotic in the classic h g wells tradition br br this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story delivered with relish by the ever tasteful verhoeven and bacon as the genius turned loonytoon maniac as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of boy's own comic book adventure the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend animals beaten to death literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea the cg special effects by scott e anderson are eye poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries cardiovascular systems muscles tissue bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere in particular a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon drowns devane in a swimming pool are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror movie photography by jost vacano the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree but both shue and dickens are impressively out of their depth this is a great fun nasty movie
<START> george cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch ronald colman's performance which earned him an oscar still stands up despite a few overwrought moments Â it's hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life there are a number of interesting subtexts and cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much the script by garson kanin and ruth gordon is brilliant mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from shakespeare's king lear as a reference to both the film's main theme of jealousy and colman's character's obsession with identity br br several interesting things about this movie Â superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors in other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets but i don't really think this story's primary concern is acting or the job art of acting per se i think anthony's struggles represents a broader existential question a deeply buried uncertainty about identity there's a key i feel in his relationship with his ex wife britta signe hasso he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration and at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her i'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me especially because it's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top perhaps the implication is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship marriage implies a union of the soul in the traditional conception it's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film it's not completely unprecedented hawks' comedy his girl friday springs to mind among others but it is unusual and probably significant especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation in a way the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self love
<START> i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didn't look right the same way porky pig doesn't look right in the old 1930's cartoons but i digress br br anyway this episode in the friendly phantom's afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghost br br casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semi spoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you can't really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next br br the finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact it's probably the saddest i've ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me i haven't seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy again br br i'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most i've ever been moved by an animated short
<START> while traveling by train through europe the american jesse ethan hawke and the french celine julie delpy meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria on the next morning jesse returns to united states of america and celine to paris br br before sunrise is one of my favorite romances indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect and the dialogs are stunning the direction is amazing transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer i have just completed my review number 1 000 in imdb and i choose before sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar with such a magnificent screenplay direction and performances yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and i still love it my vote is ten br br title brazil antes do amanhecer before sunrise
<START> being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it i was not disappointed in fact this film greatly exceeded my expectations knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on moon child has just the right amount of humour action romance and serious heart wrenching moments i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair in my opinion definitely proving their skills as actors the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde
<START> this movie is great it touched my stone cold heart i couldn't relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because i'm living in my own country i guess it is really hard to be discriminated br br we watched this film in our sociology class in new era university and i didn't knew that it was a true story i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry it is very good br br the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone who was just six sexually if i were on his shoes i could have jumped a ten story high building i salute him for he being so strong br br the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face he did not bitched her or whatever instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated i think i'll do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots
<START> i can't believe others took such a serious view of all this god it was a lot of fun rooting for hop a long cassidy it was a great tribute to the western serials of years ago it wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience except it was so what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza it was a fun tongue in cheek look at old western's man relax and enjoy
<START> i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh so i have decided to write my own i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then first of all let me say that overall the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults it is worth watching the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman's visit a restrictive narrow minded anglo canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis en scene the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people and in that sense it is exactly accurate the acting especially by rip torn whitman and colm feore as the doctor is very good the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time overall what's not to like besides name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life
<START> this film though critically acclaimed has of course not yet been released in the u s on dvd like another great christine lahti's housekeeping out the same year but if you can support region 4 australian dvd's this little masterpiece should be in your collection there are still some vhs copies available on the internet as well davis is complemented by a great story as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast especially claudia carvan and the late great jan adele amazingly or maybe not this film and its stars went unacknowledged at academy awards time as did housekeeping but treat yourself to both of them you will be glad you did
<START> just finished watching the groove tube which i first saw about 23 years ago when i was a teenager staying up way past my bedtime watching hbo with my brother and his best friend we had also watched animal house just before that so we saw two movies that starred an snl alumna and had some naked breasts good thing our parents were asleep the whole time anyway there were lots of weird and funny things in this movie that were eye openers like the brown 25 sequence of the uranus industries commercial with the taste of beef stew says the announcer as what is apparently human excrement comes out of a white tube ewww or the face of the puppet talking about vd a scrotum with a small penis with eyes glued on chevy chase and richard belzer made their feature film debuts here chase is hilarious whether doing a geritan spot with a woman stripping having his hands have sex in a let fingers do it commercial or singing four leaf clover with co writer director ken shapiro drumming his hands on his head belzer teams with shapiro in the dealers movie and on channel one evening news with one wild bit having belzer as a black prostitute trying tricks on reporter ken who plays lionel here lionel that sounds like a train that i'm going to ride like a choo choo other outrageous bits include the koko show with shipiro as a kid clown show host who after ordering the people over ten to leave the room reads requests of his viewers like passages of fanny hill or how about the olympics segment with a german couple making love being announced by two men one of them spanish as they get explicit while please stand by keeps interrupting on the screen or the animated segment on the dealers which depicts dancing toilets after shapiro ingested some marijuana not everything's so dirty besides the four leaf clover skit at the end there's a highly amusing music segment with ken lip syncing his own recording of just you just me while dancing with suit and briefcase around the city with occasionally a cop co writer lane sarasohn joining in so in summation this is one weirdly funny movie that seemed to influence other like films tunnelvision kentucky fried movie and possibly saturday night live which made chevy that show's first star and despite some dated elements can still amuse today p s while i liked hearing curtis mayfield's move on up during the gorillas dancing hitchhiking beginning sequence i did wonder what the point was with the sequence of the hitchhiker and the woman who picked him up having them running from the car stripping on the run and then having the naked man get caught by the cop who stopped on the road guess it's one of those '70s streaking things
<START> soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought provoking this film's quality level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with over population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science fiction in my book a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity no fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
<START> i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didn't think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongue in cheek humor concerning families around holiday time br br ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funny br br so he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all br br also the whole doo dah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it and the parts where doo dah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable
<START> some of the worst least natural acting performances i've ever seen which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television one doesn't expect much from a lifetime movie especially one this old but this is nearly unwatchably bad br br plot wise it's a dreadful clichÃ©d romance of a type even harlequin would consider beneath them it's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes surprise the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love
