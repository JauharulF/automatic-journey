<START> having read during many years about how great this film was how it established ruiz among the french critics specially the snobbish cahiers crowd when i finally watched it about a year ago i found it pretty disappointing but then i guess my expectations were sky high shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cerebral film made for tv and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film
<START> this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock he buffalo bill cody and calamity jane are the central characters br br as the civil war closes lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film didn't erroneously attribute to horace greeley as a number of others did but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians br br in the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi wild bill uses a bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an arkansas toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontier br br hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down br br when they arrive at their destination they run into calamity jane who has a crush on hickock she looks at cody's wife and asks buffalo bill is this your mopsy the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter's books about peter rabbit three of the rabbits were flopsy mopsy and cottontail he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue it worked the line stayed in br br the indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area cody led the troops hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile indians br br calamity jane gets captured and hickock gets captured trying to save her they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane's willpower and she tells the route cody is using br br the two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them they're walking into a trap with hickok's help they hold off the indian attack br br hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner as they're waiting for authorities hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards br br there are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend pretty good for the 1930s
<START> i don't know what it is with these brady kids first barry williams publicly brags about having sexy with his tv sister maureen mccormick then about dating his tv mom florence hederson then susan cindy olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies then mike bobby lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving finally maureen marcia mccormick and eve jan plum might have had a little same sex fling on the side now christopher peter knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s during his stint on the surreal life which at first was fun to watch and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship the last episode where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to christopher for his birthday was not a good move on her part and he dealt with it in a very mature fashion just picking up and leaving to clear his head i think he was always bowing to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand and i hate to say it but i think she abuses him verbally the way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men which is not something any self respecting human being should do when already married to someone if this were a man talking down to his wife like that and going out every night partying and having sex with other people everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him why should this be any different what started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster adrianne as beautiful as she is is like another britney spears and lindsay lohan clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things i feel sorry for her but chris needs to rid himself of her because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this
<START> this is one of may all time favourite films parker posey's character is over the top entertaining and the librarian motif won't be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world br br if you're a library student rent this then buy the poster and hang it on your wall the soundtrack is highly recommendable too i've shown this film to more library friends than any other they all fall in love with it
<START> end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn't make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering br br the end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever seen and that's saying something i've seen gigli
<START> because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money a remake of heaven can wait which was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat rich dead man but are shown coming from rock himself as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong the movie is not funny poorly shot the acting is weak at best go rent heaven can wait and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game
<START> what a brilliant film i will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter at a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way cry freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid it is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko i may be wrong but although it is biko's story it is told in the perspective of woods so woods is an important character in conveying biko's story to the world br br cry freedom visually looks amazing with the show stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot george fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes it was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes the script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police's attack of the south african citizens or biko's death the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well br br the performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn't a single bad performance regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in denzel washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as biko and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington's and the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note penelope wilton is lovely as donald's wife wendy and she is a great actress anyway out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me one was timothy west who relishes his role as captain dewet the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo role as kruger lord richard attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual br br overall a truly wonderful film ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving a definite winner from lord richard attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise 10 10 bethany cox
<START> there wasn't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after i left the cinema having seen this gem of a film in a sold out house as part of this year's hamburg film festival and the tears shed were all of laughter this film was hilarious there's no other way of saying this there wasn't one boring bit in it i laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of french cinÃ©ma br br alain chabat was absolutely terrific a great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it the performance was of course completely over the top but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well equally great was charlotte gainsbourg who i love to see a lot and the mother was also a very strong performance the sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script wise but apart from that there is nothing to moan about i had a great afternoon seeing this film while hamburg was drowning in rain outside and i wish films like this from france would get a regular release in germany but the distributors is this country don't seem to understand that the french make good films i at least can't wait to find a dvd which offers subtitles hello australia please because that film i need at home to watch several more times
<START> its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode br br but don't worry ill explain it too you br br this episode is split in 2 parts br br first part is tony's dream in his coma second part is what happens in real life br br now what people didn't understand is that tony's dream is more then just a dream in this episode its about his preparation for his death he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world you will notice what i'm saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains his life they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they're own thoughts of what happens when you die br br if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meanings br br like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb br br only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks gonna re watch it till i get this br br anyways this episode really touched me and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience br br 10 10 no doubt
<START> hanna barbera sucks the life out of another famous property the violence is watered down the stories are formulaic the animation is bad the music is obnoxious and repetitive and frankly the show just isn't funny br br at the time h b put every one of its series through the same clichÃ©d situations regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not thus popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen hey popeye is popular and the flinstones are popular put 'em together and you can't miss also in an apparent ripoff of private benjamin olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits seriously why br br adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely recycling and are you ready for this the dangers of smoking i swear i'm not making that up br br the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer the voice of popeye from the early days continues the role here br br worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts otherwise avoid at all costs
<START> don't listen to fuddy duddy critics on this one this is a gem young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies and now they have to work for a living she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob by wild co incidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers with all the grace of a steam shovel br br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously it's all good fun from those wonderful pre code days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity thank god she stopped the dancing gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace and an occasional wink to the audience great fun
<START> i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the film's director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m a film directors this was not an overly 'shocking' film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film making on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived over emphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the 'fig leaf' reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale br br we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him br br the film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefully montaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground br br but the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers' stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film making director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work br br andy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making high sounding excuses for a publicity seeking film
<START> there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this stinking load hey genius triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about asian culture the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless this dvd does prove useful i do love my new coaster br br so kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead
<START> there are three kinds of bad films the cheap the boring and the tasteless the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless br br boring films are just well boring if you don't leave quickly enough you fall asleep br br tasteless films actually have their defenders but the fact remains that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people br br only the cheap bad films are really funny because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately they way over reached beyond their abilities and available resources br br bo derek is just naturally boring and tasteless fortunately fate and a lack of funds and skill redeem her by making her seem cheap as well this film is hilarious and it may well be the last really funny bad film ever made br br i first saw this in a theater may god forgive me i was laughing so hard i was rolling off my seat and so too with most of the rest of the audience br br it's clear that derek and her husband promoter conceived of this film as partly a satire unfortunately the dereks clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to pull that off consequently the 'satirical' element comes off as some school girl's impression of some gay young man's impression of frank gorshin's impression of the riddler in batman trying to pretend he's robin it doesn't fly over our heads it has no clue where any human head might be br br on the other hand there are some supposedly serious moments in this film it is supposed to be an action film remember that are so astoundingly cheesy one wonders if someone squirted spoiled milk in one's eye br br as for derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts i can't imagine a less erotic nudity photographic display she is so weird looking with those broad shoulders i can't imagine what any one ever saw in her br br as for the plot such as it is well it isn't derek chases around africa and god alone knows why then her father harris pretends to act in some maniacal puppet show and then of course there's the hunk'o'tarzan that seems to have wondered in from advertisement without knowing that the subject's changed probably because he hasn't seen a script apparently no one has br br negligible camera work shoddy editing if it weren't for the 3 way with the chimp the film would be unbearable br br as it is it's a real hoot
<START> i first saw martin's day when i was just 10 years old at home on the movie channel and still remember the impact it made on my life it touched me as no other film had touched me and i remember balling my eyes out br br after the first time i saw it i couldn't find it anywhere else i would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film i guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about because no one and i mean no one knew what i was talking about i searched and searched throughout the years checking video stores shelves and scanning cable tv listings but always came up short finally in 1996 i found out i could special order it i did and have probably watched it at least 50 times since and it still makes me cry every time br br martin's day is about martin steckert a man who is in prison but genuinely a good guy who yearns to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy this was a special place where he lived off nature spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life soon into the movie he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake br br it isn't long before the cops find him and steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off soon steckert and his hostage the 2nd martin become best friends and have many fun adventures together from robbing a toy truck to hi jacking a train all on the way to this special lake br br throughout the movie steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boy br br i won't ruin the ending for you but i will tell you this movie is a must see it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life i am without a doubt the biggest fan of this movie ever i managed to find the song that the two martin's are singing throughout the movie i'm going back to where i come from i'm even planning a trip to canada to see the lake and cottage where martin's day was filmed crazy i know but that movie just means so much to me

<START> br br cheap looking and ugly this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for one fairly amusing toilet joke christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help Â  elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation there is really no reason to make this movie especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williams's often brilliant improvisations in mork mindy br br
<START> this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better the last one heaven can wait was great i suggest you see that one this one is not so great the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today however i don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie it plays like some really bad b movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit com the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad i don't know how they could release this movie like that anyway the last part isn't to bad so wait for the video and see it then
<START> i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex pistols john lydon then as a bonus the music by ennio morricone i expected an old school edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america istead i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying wtf too many unanswered questions and not enough action the result a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet keitel and lydon work well together so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script oh and the morricone score ok but not memorable br br overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore keitel fan
<START> it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good casting acting all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish this thief of baghdad 1940 and the adventures of robin hood 1938 some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of 1939 moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in 1942 here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library
