<START> i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this 'master' really doesn't have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the season br br the acting was good i don't know how he wrangled it but we've got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series br br i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen pecked hubby br br really good effort like i've said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
<START> really i liked it the premise was good the story fit where both respective series left off and here's my favorite part mary and valerie aren't bitter they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions a prime example is susan dey the partridge family in fact valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie and then mary said the same thing later so i would be on the look for another but if that doesn't quite work out then they can re run this one
<START> i just got through watching this dvd at home we love westerns so my husband rented it he started apologizing to me half way through the saddles costumes accents everything was off the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul his only excuse was he only had 2 arrows left we watched it all the way through and as someone else said too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked i mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found what's the point of that and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie however if you want a real western you will hate this movie
<START> this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you can't the writing is so obvious and facile it's sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this br br that said it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but that's only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this we'd be disgusted br br so it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly fascinatingly bad and the incidental music as opposed to the trying too hard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby doo but not as good
<START> very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man br br pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters but without a realistic backdrop such characters are pointless br br nothing to see here keep moving br br
<START> very light spoilers maybe br br normally a fan of diane keaton i tried to watch this tonight i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother both came across as self absorbed with little regard for others with the daughter also adding in rude disrespectful and reckless to the mix when the daughter died the only thing i thought was at least we won't have to watch her anymore keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving but it was too far gone for me by then i simply wasn't enjoying it so i stopped watching if you want me to care for the protagonist you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner if it's nearly an hour in and i don't care it's too late br br the supporting cast was sincere and well played i felt for them and the gay best friend was wonderful but even combined that wasn't enough to carry the film for me
<START> alone in the dark is one of my favorite role playing games of all time i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in now mind you i am weary of computer game generated movies i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre although some are entertaining enough to be watchable and yet i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist my rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's it would be ok br br man those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that i'll never get back if i had that chance i would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead this isn't even in the so bad it's funny category you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb now tara reid i'm not complaining about her presence however if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene which i totally understand and support hey i'm a guy i've seen more of her body on press conferences br br there is no plot to speak of won't waste your time pitching it to you the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms lewinski' the acting is but a few notches above 'street fighter' which by the way being one of the worst movies i've seen i would recommend over this one br br kids i recommend the video game it has far better story acting and much more thrills as for the movie here's a spoiler it stinks wait for the porno version
<START> this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than 90 of the scream rip offs out there i even hope they come up with a sequel
<START> i thought this was a very clunky uninvolving version of a famous australian story heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some personality but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical br br the beginning could have been a lot more involving perhaps starting with a shootout and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted like a very bad tv soap br br i was really looking forward to this movie and hoping for something a lot better the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version but not by much
<START> it has been said that deanna durbin invented teenagery this first film was one of the best the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna a little beauty with a gorgeous voice as the miss fixit in a family split by divorce for plot summary see other imdb entries but quickly deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to america from switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sisters good direction and editing the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings of deanna's three songs only il bacio is from the classical repertoire but when she sings it in that police station scene the film's place in history is assured at least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music one of the many nice touches that occur throughout three smart girls is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck for a final glimpse of deanna as the cops hustle him by one unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for durbin vehicles became locked into the miss fixit theme which quickly became stale deanna herself never did her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma which she certainly had it seems to me that like many another film personality she substituted naturalness for the histrionic ability that she lacked the ploy worked well for 21 feature films
<START> i could not for the life of me follow figure out or understand the story as the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible i'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story plot problem that never got sorted out the producers could never separate the many details that the novel or any novel has the time and space to create from the other idea which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police they ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit too bad really because they had a solid cast a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography in fact a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours
<START> this is one of those film's pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps but isn't necessary what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn't something so far away in the future this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced quite talented actors eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re united w his daughter however real or not she is he'll do it no matter the cost paula malcomson of deadwood fame is terrific as his wife as well you are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani her performance esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections i didn't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story it's great to see adama as a child already being affected influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots this is an almost perfect pilot i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen if you haven't gotten into bsg least try this i'll bet you become a fan will want to see how the bsg story came to be
<START> dracula ii ascension is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students 30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction it's an offer they can hardly refuse soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the vatican dracula ii ascension is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws the characters are one dimensional and the acting is pretty average there are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene but there is not enough violence for my liking the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look i prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60's and early 70's like lips of blood the brides of dracula or lemora a child's tale of supernatural to name only a few 4 out of 10
<START> i didn't expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a good bad film br br every scene was by rote as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script leaned back and said my work is done it's all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously even when the plot developments are laughable br br do yourself a favor watch the x files if you're in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that
<START> a short review but br br avoid at all costs a thorough waste of 90mins at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened it's full of cameos stephen fry 3mins jack dee 30 secs the philadelphia girls and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense whether the story just got lost in the edit i don't now but jeez br br put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest br br 2 out of 10 for the cameos and a morris minor car chase br br
<START> endearing tale voted ten against all averages for my age and sex not all that much comedy compared to a i almost wet myself movie although funny enough not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally ahab no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling reminding you of what romance could and should be like something to shoot for my summary describes it best in very few words quite charming
<START> visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced the special effects are beautiful and imaginative the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no brain club but if you are looking for something more he's where you will find it
<START> oh dear yet another example of oireland and religion no doubt we'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some hunky and macho freedom fighters from the ira well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock what a superb movie br br the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s there is a slight problem since they're getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they're old enough the story which is set in the 1950s then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they'll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford from there things escalate br br let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece perhaps i shouldn't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you br br in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i don't claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there's no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isn't blameless herself think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives there's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member that makes a change we're not talking about the devil's own here but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself br br a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself all of which i agree with if there's any sort of criticism it's that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses
<START> i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with chickens they are on the make or beating each other up it's as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the cuckoo's nest where the illnesses are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didn't see any of these guys these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life
<START> i don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didn't know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with o j 's attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the 'drama' was emotionless i am thankful i didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience
