<START> this movie is great this movie is beautiful finally a movie that portrays moslems as people no stereotypes here this movie is driven by the story by the acting and above all by its theme that of cultural affirmation and discovery they may seem like clichÃ©s but they are not at least not in this movie the vista of the grand mosque of mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the west here the people are caring supportive devout tolerant and devoted to each other what a welcomed and way overdue departure from the usual negative portrayals of arabs outstanding movie
<START> a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title farewell my lovely thinking the gullible would assume it a remake the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released time only adds to it its absurdity having none of the guile cinematography desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours as if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days this only made this mess all the more painful to watch find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure
<START> necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic moby dick john barrymore is captain ahab who falls in love with the pastor's daughter joan bennett his brother derek is a rival for ms bennett's affections when mr barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident bennett rejects him he must slay the whale and win bennett back br br there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg the film hasn't aged well however there are much better films from the time both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies the two name attractions john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best br br moby dick 8 14 30 lloyd bacon john barrymore joan bennett lloyd hughes
<START> along with the maratonci trce pocasni krug from the same director one of the masterpieces of ex yugoslavia comedies if you want to understand serbian mentality you must see this movie and if you want to see several of ex yugoslav great actors at the same time this is a opportunity
<START> humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i wasnÂ´t expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it doesnÂ´t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
<START> the film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book which as far as i can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction in reality there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed i'm sure he'd have to admit he's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient aramaic found in peru these valuable texts written as usual by anonymous were destroyed by the evil truth haters in the church and in the local government that's rather strange as all kinds of new age crap comes out each year hundreds of books dozens of movies and the roman catholic church doesn't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as i do a total crock of doody i'm no fan of the church mind you but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real br br it's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in joseph smith's case got taken back to heaven once translated therefore the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the smithsonian nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like coptic or aramaic it's a scam in one sense i admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it but i couldn't do it myself as i've no desire to mislead the public with more new agey hokum br br occasionally a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years the gospel of judas a gnostic text was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text deemed authentic by experts the gospel of judas was referenced as heretical around 300 c e no church documents from that time mention any celestine prophecies as authentic heretical or anything else br br we are evolving towards something that much is true but the optimism in the celestine prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies like a castle built on sand will collapse the harsh ugly overpopulated cruel world of blade runner is more likely what it'll be like over the horizon than some utopian hippie commune where all is love and peace i tell people the truth and they hate me but tell them what they want to hear even if pure piffle and one can make millions the celestine prophecy is what the world wants to hear too bad it is a castle built on sand don't get me wrong i wish to god the celestine vision was reality only it's not no ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution these new agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until darwininan evolution became well known that means the ideas in the celestine prophecies cannot be older than the 1800s c e and do not go back to the early b c e period or near the time of jesus of nazareth this type of claim by new agers is not at all unusual wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft the old religion goes back to the stone age when in reality no book of shadows has ever been known to exist prior to gerald gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of aleister crowley br br new age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by gurus today why do they do what they do perpetrate such fraud simple there are millions of dollars to be made and the modern guru acquires power over his or her followers they compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things each new age group bitter opposes the others it's a struggle for your minds and your wallets br br but learn one thing from me that is actually similar to one of the insights learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within that i can agree with wholeheartedly
<START> i can hardly believe that this inert turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works i've quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali 112 for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of alienating his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so or for us to watch the dull results of his labor
<START> this movie probably had some potential for something my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs they return to ingest their own vomit well they're 19 bucks richer now because of me this was not at all imaginative there was no redeeming moment anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer and nothing amusing was in the trailer performances were strained especially molly's totally unconvincing what was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for disney films none of his analogies hit home his little moral speeches were flat i was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful only to find out he was done the so called hard 10 is the most insipid plastic creature there is apart from having a horse like face with a weird smile i honestly found her friend patty referred to as the hamburglar to be much better looking than her but then again gentlemen prefer brunettes well anyway the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades the way they showed this with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million times mutilated and beaten to death horse premature ejaculation routine with obvious allusions to american pie and happiness the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog i feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage goes to show marketing can push anything out there shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold people will come worked for me done with tirade
<START> one of the very best three stooges shorts ever a spooky house full of evil guys and the goon challenge the alert detective agency's best men shemp is in top form in the famous in the dark scene emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr goodrich role as the target of a murder plot before it's over shemp's trusty little shovel is employed to great effect this 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any stooge's short and packs twice the wallop highly recommended
<START> 2005 gave us the very decent gore porn flick hostel and 2006 gave us live feed a not so decent rip off of hostel live feed follows pretty much the same formula as eli roth's earlier film except this time the dumb kids are in asia rather than central europe the plot focuses on these dumb kids and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble the locals decide to lock them all in a theatre and kill them despite the fact that i'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it i still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director ryan nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film 'torched' but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring the film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of grindhouse cinema which hostel did successfully but it really doesn't come off surprisingly considering nicholson's previous work in special effects not even the gore is impressive although it is a lot better than the acting there's not much else i can say about this film it's bad and not in a good way avoid it
<START> the devil dog hound of hell is really good film it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and r g armstrong the music is spooky and gives that devilish chill i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns frill like part on his neck and acted really viscous if you like horror films and haven't seen the devil dog hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i don't think you'll be disappointed
<START> what a disgrace i was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered james garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be the production quality was fine but the plot was undeniably lame and i can honestly say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now the movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give hallmark a bad name for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it's about nothing and in this case it's not a good thing we are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her she drags him through one mess after another gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself the whole time then the movie ends what a relief that was not worth the time it would take to watch it so do yourself a favor and skip this one you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is
<START> atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a solid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
<START> how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face that's how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some retard drugged out screen writer that's how
<START> in case you're a self acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and or bad movie making there comes a certain point in life Â preferably sooner than later Â that you have to watch attack of the killer tomatoes it's an inescapable certainty as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made one tiny but essential detail however is that attack of the killer tomatoes is deliberately awful right from the opening message already mocking alfred hitchcock's the birds this is clearly intended as a zero budgeted parody and i can't escape the impression that writer director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so called eco horror movies plants animals and nature in general revolting against humanity and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato attacks coming from all over the country the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices the first half hour of attack of the killer tomatoes is very entertaining as silly as it is the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song the jaws homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash see the trivia section for more details that made it to the final cut after that however the whole thing turns into a tedious unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots personally i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels which i saw before seeing the original because they benefit from slightly better production values incredibly over the top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin the addams family as the mad scientist dr gangreen but as said before already the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life
<START> moonstruck is one of the best films ever i own that film on dvd the movie deals with a new york widow cher who falls in love with her boyfriend's danny aiello angry brother nicholas cage who works at a bakery i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie nicholas cage and danny aiello are great too the direction from norman jewison who directed fiddler on the roof is fantastic moonstruck is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh a must see br br 10 10 stars
<START> i can't say i liked this movie very much it has some amusing moments but it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama it doesn't really work as either it's too light in tone to be a drama and the amusing moments are few and far between it also doesn't make a lot of sense things seem to happen for no reason and it's also extremely convoluted i feel like they just made things up as they were going if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things this might have been a better movie i would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something which it didn't it just sorts ends and that's that i didn't find it boring really but like i said there there just isn't any point i'll give winter kills a reluctant and weak 3 10
<START> i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov 2006 in london i was not really into cream until now it was through a high end arcam system it sounded great with dts i had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd it does not matter what type of music you like this one will definitely grow on you it's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days as these old rockers do
<START> i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges guietary sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant's nimble piano fingers the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem 8 10
<START> i'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money michael winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it the plot is rich with mystery and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat she finds that she can't afford most properties she looks at but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price her problems start soon after moving in as she doesn't like her neighbours very much and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour an elderly blind priest on the top floor br br the cast list is truly superb with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines but small parts for the likes of john carradine eli wallach ava gardner jeff goldblum and christopher walken to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon's lifeless portrayal michael winner does a good job with his central location as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story the film is a little slow to start but it's never boring and michael winner's screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the offset which certainly deserves some praise like many similar slow burning horrors this one doesn't go for the money shot early on but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true i've got to say that he does a very good job at it overall while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better films of its type and it's definitely a major highlight for its director
