<START> spanish horrors are not bad at all some are smart with interesting stories but is not the case of second name it is badly directed badly acted and boring boring boring a missed chance for an interesting story
<START> this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that br br if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isn't worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the script i e i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadn't seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger that's about all that i can find good to say about this picture
<START> if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was 24 when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film it's pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie juarez mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a snitch'2 with a higher budget
<START> leslie sands' stilted play deadlock becomes a poor choice vehicle for bette davis and gary merrill just after their joint success in all about eve after killing her spouse a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house irving rapper one of bette's best directors from her peak years is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material in which davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale where she thankfully pulls out all the stops production and supporting cast strictly second rate only for bette davis completists 1 2 from
<START> johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts minus the fangs of course they're dark bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery through their charms namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet respectively they seduce desperate souls who they proceed to torment and victimize that's more or less the basis of this black comedy as i understand it br br it's not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy main character i did enjoy however the sound and the melody of the rapid fire and supposedly very witty remarks i was very impressed by the cast's strong acting particularly david thelis's only the character of jeremy seemed too bi dimensional the photography and the music both dramatic and somber work very well together br br what really turns me off about naked and the main reason i'd never recommend it to anyone is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst in other words in a world that sucks so bad what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls right to suggest as some have on this website that johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as jeremy seems completely absurd to me they're both terrible nasty people and they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass but still his and jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter and i could be wrong but i'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical
<START> someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high noon now that is a real stretch i'm a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don knotts first off as someone pointed out sinatra just doesn't have the build for a western bad guy wannabe he's just too 'slight' at this point in his life maybe he was about the same height as say audie murphy but murphy had a pretty solid build sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously br br the story is uninspired and really not credible i don't want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story doesn't make any sense another thing these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy' this is just a little town so i don't get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way br br there is a 'love interest' in the story and if i followed it right she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldn't kill him now there's true love for you 'stand up for yourself tell him your name so he will kill you ' lol stop you're killing me br br unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isn't good enough and no matter how they tried this story didn't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket want to know why it's not on video and never shown on tv the critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right this movie is pretty bad i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible br br you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy try tension at table rock or at gunpoint two really really good westerns with that theme johnny concho is johnny stinko frank you were the greatest singer ever but you didn't belong in a movie like this
<START> this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning ww ii codes being broken stolen etc the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm b actors br br one big caution jean rogers who did such a great job playing the very sexy dale arden in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie her character is extremely annoying she absolutely never lets up with her overacting we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function from that standpoint i'm sorry that i ever watched this film it has forever changed my perception of ms rogers talentwise she is an extreme lightweight br br lee bowman is his usual self meaning that he is merely adequate br br
<START> who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordon's legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's this script hangs together by clichÃ©s awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg's jaws started there's an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus' new sport complex gnaw food of the gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it's infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what freud's theory would be on that there's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and Â it has to be said Â the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can't get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest 70's cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the 2003 willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts
<START> i recently saw i q and even though i'm not a romantic comedy type of gal i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch so many movies in my opinion lack honesty you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love nothing is what it seems i would recommend this for a sunday morning br br 7 10
<START> hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring daniel day lewis is a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience br br the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes br br one important factor of christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christy's dream come true so lucky for christy and hugh o'conor is also excellent as young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy is very well done trustful christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr eileen cole surprisingly played by fiona shaw i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive i do have sympathy for him love is a two edged sword happiness and agony are just next to each other br br btw jim sheridan's works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die trying' god knows why he chose to direct that crap really a career taint for him what a pity
<START> after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex rental dvds i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes for a number of reasons american beauty doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins and is simply wonderful to watch because of it and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks' name on it still can't watch big without wanting a cat to kick i'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you'll kick yourself for if you miss it br br normally squeaky clean hanks plays michael sullivan a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early 1930's he is also a professional hit man to mob boss john rooney paul newman but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons but after his eldest tyler hoechlin witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up soon father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit man a menacing jude law is waiting for them br br on the face of it it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i've said this isn't really about gangsters at all it's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances hanks is grits teeth superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan's son in all honesty there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others the cast is pretty much faultless as is the cinematography and costumes and it's not often i praise costumes which recreates the 30's with stunning effect there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades this could easily have looked rubbish they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit chicago especially looks fantastic lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats true time travel even if a little cgi is needed br br the story is also a winner offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don't have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster the film is decidedly noir ish driving rain and ill lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are finally seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy gun shootouts and extortion rackets it can feel a little slow in places especially if you're used to masses of gun play in movies like most modern audiences like yours truly but sometimes words can speak louder than actions mendes has delivered a fine follow up to his oscar winning debut a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch road to perdition may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon
<START> br br this movie is full of references like mad max ii the wild one and many others the ladybugÂ´s face itÂ´s a clear reference or tribute to peter lorre this movie is a masterpiece weÂ´ll talk much more about in the future
<START> a well made and imaginative production refreshingly free from clichÃ© this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement the film provides freshness in nearly every scene as felon martin steckert richard harris believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood often bursting into song or dancing a few steps the capricious steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and as police close in for an inevitable showdown the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection as discerned by a psychiatrist lindsay wagner assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant james coburn who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his prisoner this is an engrossing story worth telling a quickly paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by harris fine turns from wagner coburn and karen black along with justin henry as the snatched lad with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by wilfred josephs and top notch cinematography by frank watts with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province
<START> all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies i've ever seen i first saw it when i was like 3 now i'm 12 and i rented it it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories those were the days i love the music i love when charlie is arriving in heaven i love the song let me be surprised i love how charlie looks and his voice bert reynolds could only play charlie's voice this great i love this movie the 1st one is the best one because it's so original and great it really does bring back memories that no one can describe not even me if only i could go back to those days i love the characters if this is the way the memories come back when i'm 12 imagine how i'll feel when i'm like 19 i hope i'll be able to watch this when i'm older when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way i hope it will be available to watch i'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart on a scale from 1 10 i'd give it a perfect 10 it's an amazing movie it's so hard to explain the feeling when i get older and if i have kids i hope they can experience this feeling
<START> the little mermaid is one of my absolute favorite disney movies i'm sorry to say however that disney completely messed up when they made this sequel i'll admit it has some good points to it the songs aren't bad and the animation is clean and clear there is some humor i'm sure i don't remember because after watching it i immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again the worst point of this movie is the plot in this movie ariel becomes her father she forbids her daughter to go near the sea yes out of fear just as she was forbidden to go near the land i personally think that given her past ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated br br besides this fact ursula was replaced by a non scary pathetic sort of sea witch the underfed forgotten sister who is more comical than scary she too has some little underling to do her bidding but she's not scarier or worse than ursula ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness this sea witch is a joke br br to make matters worse flounder is a fat deep voiced father no longer the cute guppy we all know and love and eric's voice is not even done by the same actor something that always annoys me in a remake sequel his voice difference was very obvious to me by the way i felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that disney could catch a few fast dollars something i hate to think about a corporation i actually really do enjoy i felt that this plot lacked imagination i know that this act child following in the footsteps of a parent happens but ariel was different that was what we loved so much about her she had a dream she fell in love and she made that dream come true until she appeared in this movie that is then she became just like the other adults this isn't the ariel i know and i don't like her br br i know of some children who have enjoyed this film and i know some adults who didn't mind it either but for me and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for ariel please don't see this movie the ariel we know dies within resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isn't bad where she accepts the water back again although she takes very little part in the ending regardless
<START> charming doesn't even begin to describe saving grace it's absolutely irresistible anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high haha br br grace trevethyn brenda blethyn has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash fast she gets an idea when her gardener matthew craig ferguson asks the town famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top quality weed and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts br br the most notable quality about saving grace is its likability every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first 20 or so minutes the film is non stop good cheer everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities br br the acting is top notch brenda blethyn is one of britain's finest actresses and here is why she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual she's a nice lady but she's not stupid craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew he's a deadbeat loser but he's so likable that it doesn't matter the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo the french actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skills br br nigel cole finds the perfect tone for saving grace it's all about the charm one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film not so here the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing that's not to say that saving grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling while this movie is not an out and out comedy it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical br br if there's any problem with the film it's that the climax is a little confusing the questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twist br br see saving grace especially when you're having a bad day
<START> i didn't know the real events when i sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story after the death of the kid's father rhonda tries to help her daughter desiree i did not know anyone actually named their offspring that cope with the loss this is really made for children as is often the case with family flicks with that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though i'd keep teenagers out of it unless you're sure they're gonna buy the concept but it doesn't downplay the sting that the death of a parent is and it doesn't really talk down to anyone the plot is sufficiently interesting and moves along well enough acting varies with the excellent burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast mathis following that pretty well and ferland and her peers with a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunch and frankly they're irritating then again i'm not really in the intended audience for this thing the editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one there is an intense scene or two in this i recommend this to fans of these types of movies 7 10
<START> i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer a customer of metasonix modular synths made by someone dear to me the jacket art says the 2003 version br br i give it one point for a strong female one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster's light blue eyes of which there are plenty of shots of br br it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming the pool has a plexiglass viewing window while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece br br the sets were marginally impressive that is rich people's houses in l a and mendanassos sp where the castle was i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around the wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty etc and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire blow out the match then throw the match into the fire dumb stuff like that it was clunky at best oh well robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it
<START> most people 36 gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's it grows on you and has it all i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint having plenty of action drama romance and even comedy add to that the great car chases automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun edge of your seat experience you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this br br you can watch this movie with your wife gf and you will both enjoy it lots the premise is that of a paperback book hero like doc savage really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here the actor jake speed is also a director producer and writer of many films in this film jake speed the character is an indiana jones adventurer type he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower yay and sheer dumb luck too keep an eye out for his one james bond hi tech equipment the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky br br the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie once bitten and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister br br the bad guys are real bad men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel sadly never made but you can just imagine what would happen next br br you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket
<START> conrad hall went out with a bang the great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on he did himself proud as this is one of the best looking crime films you'll ever see br br of course the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads the amount of action in here is just right too not too much not too little br br none of the characters in here frankly are good guys as hanks is a professional hit man for town boss newman hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies huh br br as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is the real star of this film is cinematographer hall who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens his work is just awesome
