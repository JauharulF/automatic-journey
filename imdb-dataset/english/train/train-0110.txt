<START> the novelty of hearing clean cut jay leno spout four letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched police partners caper in collision course the pelican faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger think car lover leno played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but leno is no actor and morita's fish out of water routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100 minute running time fans of leno's considerable comedic talents will feel let down everyone else will just be bored
<START> i like this movie much it's special type of humor by ondricek and machacek i think it's better then samotari loners maybe it's difficult to understand when you are not czech if you are not watching that movie just enjoy it don't mind about anything else just relax
<START> a very refreshing story the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human's shows humans from a bird's point of view especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with not all birds are bird brained
<START> put the camera on me is a deceptively cute film it is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist on the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids one of the film's directors darren stein had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies sure these are just some cute kids having fun but this is also much more this is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life fear sexual awakening unrequited love loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us as we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little br br what makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young darren stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker it is clear that darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends their problems the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life a lot of children make home movies but i've never heard of or seen children create little movies about the holocaust homosexuality nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends these kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff br br the power of this film is the way stein and shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids all now adults and all still friends this adds a new angle to the film how many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends these guys have and many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later br br among the conflicts a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a sticky subject between two of the men some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years darren stein is a director no doubt about it br br stein and shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people this is particularly true for stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer writer and director from the first moment of put the camera on me we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out we also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always nice or caring and this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience br br there are so many revealing moments but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a nazi we discover thru interviews and narration that the nazi is played by a jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child it is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child br br this is much more than some home movies this documentary captures the pain beauty joy and sadness of growing up powerful stuff and well worth seeing br br
<START> how disney can you get preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho analysis this movie sucked br br the girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant yes milk going to employ the workers they keep it afloat until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb webcam in the cayman islands huh not worth my time ever again br br but it is better than howl's moving castle d
<START> tom hulce turns in yet another oscar worthy performance as dominick luciano the brain damaged garbage man who's helping put his brother ray liotta as eugene through medical school br br this is a must see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people br br from the small studder to the eratic dancing to the repeated words oh jeez whenever nicky is in a bind the belieavablitly of tom's performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that it's an actor on screen
<START> i can't believe that the city of muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there this show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law enforcement officers i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life if they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie i only saw it once and was appalled at what i saw i wanted to see the little guy get into a foot chase with a bad guy what a joke that would have been nothing on the show was even close to the real world the city of muncie the police chief and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city no wonder it didn't stay around on tv
<START> the cover art which features a man holding a scary pellet gun would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film hardly br br i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior trojan is a brand of condoms in the us this movie is loaded with homoeroticism if you like that stuff then this film isn't that bad really however consider these points br br there are numerous close ups of actors' groins butts one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime peach and red from a cinematographer's standpoint this movie's a drag queen several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another occasionally touching as they converse also the cousin of the hero likes women and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey br br shall i go into the fight scenes yes someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative no fancy stuff here just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low speed chase put on film
<START> i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment but it was just boring it appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends and from there casually decided to make a movie br br it is frequently unwatchable lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road with the same music played repeatedly unfortunately renee harmon is barely in the movie harmon probably would have livened things up perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed br br of course the bikers terrorize a small town fights murder a cowardly cop a goofy mechanic etc one of the bikers always wears a football helmet a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws br br the script has nothing to offer one scene features a biker assaulting a woman yelling in the lady's face you're all the same you're all the same we come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares you're all the same couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say br br at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys we also learn that the wedding between middle aged mechanic joe and young susie has been canceled susie is going away to college and we abruptly learn that joe's wedding is still on but with a different bride end
<START> i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater i'd been waiting for this since before they started filming i wasn't disappointed br br minor spoilers below br br overall it was good but it also lacked the continuity of the first two identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama this movie felt choppy at times the plot building down times were slightly too drawn out that caused the following action to feel too frenetic br br camera speaking of frenetic the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me i know its has been talked whined about to nausea on the message board but it doesn't mean it's not relevant all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie it is a cheap student director trick to make the film feel unsettled i'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids but not in this classy adult action series too much extreme close up also do some framing get some interesting shots constant close up feels like lazy directing to me br br story the story was very confusing at first they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you've missed some crucial information felt rushed or compressed for time reasons after you catch up however the story is quite good it's enjoyable following leads along with bourne however i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy landy bourne on the phone being in the middle of ultimatum thing it basically makes the movie a half prequel i thought that was awkward br br cast characters the star of the movie is the action obviously there are only two originals left bourne and nicky parsons them teaming up was kind of odd to me i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in unless i completely missed something they never even tell you why they teamed up the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet this felt like gilroy greengrass whoever wanting to not leave open ends understandable but disappointing seriously damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy those scenes were phenomenal these assassins are as uninteresting as castel the first fella bourne fights in identity the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on clive owen was practically an afterthought that's a measure of strength for that first cast the second they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen not exactly equal this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later nothing against david strathairn scott glenn or albert finney but they're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long the acting was right on br br as a whole it was successful felt like they wanted to get the series over with though if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts eliminated scott glenn's part entirely zoomed out and taken the camera away from the seizure victim it would have been perfect br br ending spoiler br br i don't see why they leave bourne alive at the end it was my understanding this was the conclusion they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless i thought that was going to be it a full circle type of ending i did like nicky reacting to the news report though br br spoiler specifics warning quote from movie below br br bourne's last line at the end look at this look at what they make you give quoting the first assassin he killed i loved that the final scene was great except that it was vosen strathairn that shot at bourne why would he do that just out for vengeance if he was angry enough to murder why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file that didn't make sense
<START> this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie worth the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedy br br people of all ages will enjoy it my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some escapism br br deserves an a hope it does well at the box office
<START> 'the vampire bat' is definitely of interest being one of the early genre setting horror films of the 1930's but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise br br the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whale's 'frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwill's dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement br br the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by having suspicion fall on bat loving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torch wielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed one br br this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co starred also 'doctor x' and 'the mystery of the wax museum' and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though 'the vampire bat' is still weak and derivative br br all we are left with is a poor quality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the 'blondie' films a few years later
<START> horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre lover to watch a film and even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci fi horror gem while lambert hillyer's the invisible ray of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff frankenstein bride of frankenstein the mummy or lugosi white zombie island of the lost souls dracula or both the black cat the raven this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing compared to other universal horror pictures the storyline seems a bit silly but in a delightful manner karloff and lugosi of course shine as always and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography karloff plays dr janos rukh a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago stunned by rukh's invention the celebrated french scientist dr felix benet bela lugosi invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor in africa rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike it is somewhat odd that karloff who was in fact british plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi who was hungarian plays a french scientist but they are both excellent as usual as far as i am concerned these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory and i am sure they would have made something out of it either man is an icon of the horror genre and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre by the way this is one of the few films if not the only one in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife the rest of the performances are also good if not particularly worth mentioning other than the casting of karloff and lugosi the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi and for his role to have a bit more significance he is fantastic as always but his role could have been bigger and more sinister otherwise the invisible ray is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror sci fi cinema and a must see for all my fellow lugosi karloff fans
<START> i found tremors 4 the legend begins to be dull and boring all the action scenes were stupid the so called graboids are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat if not smaller the acting was horrendous and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed the story is so dumb and useless also if you want to tell a story way back in time make sure you use the same actor michael gross to be someone in the past when he's someone in the present in the other tremor movies geez if you haven't seen this film don't waste your time stick to tremors 1 2 and 3 for a good time this film however make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense
<START> here comes the romeo division to change the paradigm br br let me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streets br br i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for it br br again a truly incredible piece of film making
<START> a lot of the user comments i have seen on the imdb for this movie don't really do it justice first of all let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously it's supposed to be a fun yet stupid movie that doesn't require one to think only to enjoy it if you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour then you will be sorely disappointed yet if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors actresses and some good catch phrases then you will enjoy it
<START> three russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of monte carlo despite the fact they are down to their last franc in order to support their lavish lifestyle the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use the notes at the casinos hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot andrew hughes a us envoy arrives at monaco with his wife helen and the three decide to make pals with the visitors hoping for financial assistance one of the three russians count sergius karamzin plans to go further with continuous advance towards helen while disappointing the count's maid who loves sergius eventually circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats its obvious that von stroheim was trying to convey a message with the foolishness of american women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats rather than tell a story and the film really can bore modern audiences like me easily by doing that even the acting which is great in later evs like greed and the wedding march is just run of the mill here the film could have used improvements on various levels rating 3
<START> you already know how painful to watch this movie is but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars why the cars should be not only the victim of violation but also the only true actors and performers in it so how on earth you porsche lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests it is painful for those who love cars it is painful for those who love movies br br i want my money back
<START> it's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie played by gig young but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name br br i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona she was funny angry vulnerable caring and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania and whose father was later killed during woar war i br br as the man of the house fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home but fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much geraldine fitzgerald is the middle flirty sister who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister's boyfriend gig young br br if you're a stanwyck fan this is a no miss
<START> i watched this a few days ago so details are getting hazy the film is shot on hand held cameras and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way i can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget and so was more real however what we have here isn't much more than a not as good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyone who has seen that or any one of the other rip offs there of will know what to expect br br the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters with the weedy soft kids out of their depth close harmony singing ebonics spouting black dudes world weary sergeants bitter and twisted psychos etc etc all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation maybe it was laziness or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience all i know is it was annoying one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it this seems to be the main pivot of the plot with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way the other big bug i had was how all the characters with the exception of the psychos and the real softies would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence faced with farrell's ubiquitous stoicism immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic br br i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads which was strong and very convincing tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters this wasn't too hard br br in my imagination bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty and for my money 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch
