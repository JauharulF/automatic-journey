<START> that kid a is such a babe this movie was no titan a e of which it is in many ways modeled after but still came off as entertaining the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film
<START> tom hanks like you've never seen him before hanks plays michael sullivan the angel of death he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney paul newman an elderly irish mob boss sullivan's young son tyler hoechlin witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan's wife and other son enter jude law as a reporter photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's sometimes the pace bogs down but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty responsibility betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son other notable cast members are dylan baker stanley tucci daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie make room for some oscars
<START> blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone i only watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched in fact i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re enactment scenarios on the fbi files show by far the worst re enactments really only arrest and trial can possibly be as bad at re enactments i didn't even know that the leading man was in third eye blind until i looked the movie up here on imdb but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since i hope he is a good singer
<START> i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book film which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re read today my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin drifters grierson's magnificent documentary metropolis the cabinet of dr caligari and ecstasy came first through this book and later at my university art house cinema ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican for condoning eva's desertion of emil her subsequent divorce and the brief swim she took in the buff but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant outstandingly beautiful visual paean to love a view echoed by many imdb users a very lonely young man when i saw it i willingly concurred no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence against which individual lives are insignificant perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'the lifeforce' br br ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong disappointed she returns home and divorces him soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself after these exciting climacteric sequences a bland predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy this story is trite the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage as did most of its contemporaries long ago what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film it is sub titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub titles and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it for example the names eva and adam the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery a bee pollinating a flower a key entering a lock a breaking necklace during eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam etc and the final post suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on br br as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8 for me the film will always remain a must see although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to hedy kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood some critics who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites hula back to god's country bird of paradise or some of the early works of d w griffiths and c b demille have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film this scene was probably part of the original novel and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it br br two further thoughts firstly this is a czech film released there in 1933 its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film were they removed from the copy i saw then secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience
<START> jane eyre has always been my favorite novel when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's i was ecstatic this is the best and most complete version of the book on film this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it timothy dalton is amazing as rochester i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress zelah clark as jane and not a glamorous person i love the sets and the location for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan this is the version to watch for those of you who are interested i just found this version on dvd i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd
<START> i hated this crap every friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week if you want to see something funny go watch no on would tell starring candice cameron and fred savage it really is hilarious shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show this show really makes me sick i hate those kids and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here i ahet writing 10 lines watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment
<START> having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard hitting fact based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities but this is not it this plays like a bottom to mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s e g ss experiment camp etc perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock' sequence the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power watch channel 4's 'the holocaust' aired recently still running as of 1 no 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent in context use of actual footage this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie rating 3 5 as exploitation 1 as a treatment of the subject
<START> this is an odd film for me as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker far out by phil mucci another writer director ryan jafri contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film the cure i don't normally review films this way but what the heck i love shorts and couldn't wait to see another br br interestingly while it turned out i did like the cure i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know to his credit he encouraged me to review it anyway giving it my honest appraisal br br the film has tremendous style and as far as jafri's direction goes it's exceptional especially for such an inexperienced film maker it's his first film the combination of exceptional choices of color pacing and music that well suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making however the thing i didn't love was some of the writing while the basic idea was great the ending was just too easy to foresee i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist however considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience it bodes well for his future good job
<START> one would think as i did that with steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese a movie should be at the very least decent these stars especially martin and cleese have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time br br well apparently i was grossly mistaken this is single handedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny it pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across based solely on the big names i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever br br normally both with movies and in life i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations but with this film it's hard not to let loose i can count on one hand perhaps even two or three fingers major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made br br i tried to enjoy this i really did but the out of towners ultimately fails miserably if you really want time efficient entertainment just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet just please don't watch this movie
<START> let me being by saying the i followed watching this video by watching saw and after bleed saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though i thought it was only fairly good bleed is pretty bad the best part is seeing the female cast nude the gore is very fake looking and over done it has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and i didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending if i could i would ban these actors and actresses the only reason being is that debbie rochon maddy has been in over a hundred other videos and i've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures they should not allowed to continue this madness
<START> prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors the director as an illusionist d w griffith or f w murnau who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward the director as a smuggler filmmakers such as douglas sirk samuel fuller and mostly vincente minnelli directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films and the director as iconoclast those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang ups like orson welles erich von stroheim charles chaplin nicholas ray stanley kubrick and arthur penn br br he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was though oppressive the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations during his clips from the movies he shows us we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves br br the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make lists however canon merely denotes the best and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the best films a lot like a greatest hits tape if just as a beginning direction for film students all in all one's experience has shown that all writing about film including reviews function to construct a film canon some film canons can definitely be elitist but others can be populist as an example the internet movie database's top 250 movies list includes many films included on several elitist film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film elitists scoff like the dark knight which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films schindler's list and one flew over the cuckoo's nest and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man sin city die hard the terminator and kill bill vol 2 writer scorsese's taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as elitist and contends that this is positive br br scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism elitism concentrates all attention recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding that discrimination could easily lead to self indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jean luc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will as has been previously asserted about the all encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema one can only continue seeing films because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice and that's what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us something which can't be told without being seen first hand
<START> in this truly fascinating dark film a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money in return the devil takes his mirror image this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when balduin the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror a visual metaphor for a man at war with himself which portents his immediate future the student enjoys his money but the woman he loves is unattainable he has made a pact with the devil he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money you cannot have both balduin is haunted by his double the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action some of the scenes are incredible the sense of doom when the devil disappears with balduin's mirror image is amazing as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland' at the edge of the town no longer entirely human he has lost his soul he is like a hunted animal outside of human society there are so many other things to say about this incredible film paul wegener was an amazing actor and director a cultural hero of mine it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition don't google it get a proper book just remember it's a very early film it's a little clumsy at times but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale it's one of the best ever yes it is
<START> francesca annis michael kitchen and robson green wow what a trio ok so this is no anna karenina but it is a good love story very well written and well acted by all even a few 'laugh out loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity age bias and parental aging alzheimer's issues br br quirky guitar music added to the story as well br br while i have been a fan of ms annis' since 'lillie' in the '70s and mr kitchen's since 'the buccaneers' and 'enchanted april' i have only recently discovered mr green 'me and mrs jones' 'touching evil' etc making me ask the question why had i not seen 'reckless' until recently admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than something a man will sit through it is perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy viewing
<START> short version seed isn't worthless it's just derivative and inferior and soulless br br long version if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguely defined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutality on video and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has br br but that's if you don't have much experience with the genre if you've seen the real thing august underground's penance for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film br br other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old i understand this comparison like the video nasties seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasons those that are still popular had something special permit me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soul br br take this quote from gabriele crisanti director of burial ground on an interview on the new ish dvd we will never have more films like these because today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these won't be produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not so expensive they are real effects made with our hands br br perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but crisanti has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly exploitational the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short it's like he's seen the movies and not understood them everything on the checklist is there bs about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as crisanti puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is sooooo slow man so slow br br another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game br br anyway enough bs weak movie
<START> this had high intellectual pretensions the main lead intends to give a deep meaningful rendering with voice over for his frames of mind naturally and he was certainly influenced by the fifties sixties method which when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results see clift newman winters but here the story is abysmal besides it moves too slow you could edit at least 20 minutes including pointless flashbacks and the plot line would not be changed at times it's very doubtful that bruce dern believes in his uncle character and his portraying often verges on parody an interesting side is only skimmed over the relationship young boy hero if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him some welcome tenderness emerges but it's botched and only the final scene returns to it br br word to the wise take foley's at close range instead it has two great actors christopher walken and sean penn together it's also an offbeat movie but it's gripping suspenseful here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout
<START> the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role br br at first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone
<START> ok the portrayal of the stereotyped 'indians' in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather good here but yeah his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking ok he was never that tan in real life it's some of the most obvious brown 'indian' makeup that i have ever seen it's as bad as the 'indians' on 'f troop' and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans br br this movie is o k but typically lame story and mediocre songs like in all of elvis' later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible i keep thinking 'thank god' that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell katy jurado l q jones henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie though br br burgess meredith's 'indian' makeup is absolutely awful it's the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what i do love certain elvis movies though for example 'love me tender' 'jailhouse rock' 'viva las vegas' i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co stars mary tyler moore and ed asner 'change of habit' in which elvis plays an inner city doctor br br oh well at least elvis made a few good films but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones br br i'll always love elvis thank you thank you very much
<START> i haven't seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapper br br yea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnson br br i was a little bored that johnson was so serious br br and yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue br br i was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it not yet anyway br br there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out
<START> this has to be the worst movie i've ever attempted to watch in the first 15 minutes there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote to a just for the fun of it movie the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the 1 store or something br br if you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie he's made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse there's nothing even remotely funny in it br br i've watched a lot of movies including some i didn't care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindler's list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i've ever heard of his for tenderness sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie and another recent score of his for catch me if you can shows still more wit and sophistication as to stanley and iris i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina and danny devito's renaissance man etc they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening a story which can't be told often enough this one is an excellent addition to that genre
