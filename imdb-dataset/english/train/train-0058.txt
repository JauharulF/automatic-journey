<START> this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a columbine style attack while this movie does not answer all the big questions it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for zero day the actors if you can call them that were brilliant they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives but at no stage did i detect them really acting something tom cruise should try the use of the cctv and the 911 operator at the end was genius but i'm not sure if we needed the very last scene overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic
<START> it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in rabbit test so as a small contribution to this future effort i'd like to suggest this word br br hubiriffic adj a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific' used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film rabbit test br br joan rivers and hollywood squares producer jay redack have severely over reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82 minute festival of wretchedness trying to put together an airplane style comedy with a moldy collection of gags note to joan german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville disinterred from their graves in the catskills that's is bad enough but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style which can best be described as 'ugly' and a cast of once and future has beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags br br adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face br br i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test cabbages mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates but for self aware thinking humans i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend rabbit test
<START> plot synopsis hong kong 1966 paul wagner the man who built the victoria tunnel is murdered along with his wife by his associates his twin sons chad alex are split apart 25 years later chad a karate instructor in los angeles alex a smuggler living in hong kong join forces to avenge their parents' murder rightfully claim the tunnel br br this is the second time that jean claude van damme sheldon lettich have worked together having previously done lionheart this is also the first of three films to feature van damme playing dual roles maximum risk replicant are the others the plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story the film's sole redeeming feature being van damme's performance as two very different people Â the prissy rich kid the rough tumble cigar chomping tough guy as it goes van damme doesn't do a very good job in either role although his take on alex is mildly amusing it is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other with them wearing different clothes having different hairstyles bolo yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies
<START> to call this episode brilliant feels like too little to say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too 'cause there's never been a far from great sopranos episode so far in fact the title might be a smug invitation for those who aren't real fans yet join the club br br picking up where junior left off putting a bullet in his nephew's gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season the story begins with tony being absolutely fine with no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him he's attending some kind of convention only he's not speaking with his normal accent and there seems to be something wrong with his papers apparently he is not tony soprano but kevin finnerty or at least that's what a group of people think and until the mess is sorted out he can't leave his hotel br br naturally in pure sopranos tradition that turns out to be nothing but a dream tony is actually in a coma with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate his family and friends worried sick and junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened unfortunately it did and anthony jr looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father's life br br dreams have popped up rather frequently in the series often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists most notably in the season five show the test dream join the club however takes the metaphysical qualities of the program already hinted at by the previous episode's use of a william s burroughs poem and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way tony hallucinating about his dead friends the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning four seasons ago is one thing him actually being in what would appear to be purgatory is radically different the heavenly section of the story is crammed with allegorical significances not least the name tony is given as one character points out spelling it in a certain way will give you the word infinity and none of it comes off as overblown or far fetched david chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set ups just for their own sake it all helps the narrative talking about help from above in the case of tony soprano might be stretching it a tad though
<START> i recently watched this film at the 30'th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch don't get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g manos Â hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the 13'th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep
<START> well what was fun except for the fun part br br it's my second least favorite so far i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine' br br let's start with the good the teaser it was incredibly well done and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode br br but then there's all the bad and believe me there is a lot of it little made sense so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated whaaa the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two quotable lines br br and worst of all having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end what's the point they all pretty much died we didn't learn anything we weren't entertained and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad just very frustrating br br star shame because season 2 was doing so well
<START> this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating bed br br oh and the costumes i particularly loved marzipan's the tutu was adorable the special effects were very well done e g the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didn't make them scary but cute and huggable except for the king i suppose br br if you're a thoroughly masculine person you won't enjoy this but this is a very good movie that's good for all ages just not all levels of testosterone br br but i have a few complaints br br firstly why did they have to put the sugar plum fairy's partner in those terrible tights it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make culkin's outfit pink
<START> if you have seen friends the writing will feel very familiar especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups br br the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young about 10 years old i think now they're in their mid twenties and they meet again on a class reunion this is where the series starts br br a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once they're usually not connected in any way each story line is cut up into multiple sections which are then shown in a mixed order br br the sketches is where my problems lie with this series as in the later seasons of friends it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations one of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe the situation is then heavily exaggerated as if it wasn't silly enough if you're into this kind of in your face humor then maybe you'll like this series for me it is a great turn off br br the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons there are interesting and especially credible story lines with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters the class has none of this the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far it's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them br br at least with friends it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out but in the class it seems it has run out of steam before it even started
<START> while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is it's a shame as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy are very good chase films so he could be really funny given good material unfortunately in this film he's given absolutely nothing even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss and the gags are so poor it's a shame as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't br br by the way for those used to the look for charley from the mid 1920s on you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache and looks very little like you'd expect
<START> as an altman fan i'd sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least marginally brilliant br br big mistake br br this is one of altman's big cast mishmashes thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally or so it feels with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room it doesn't br br as maltin points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of alfre woodard who outshines the vets all around her but other than that avoid at all costs which is pretty easy to do it's never been released on video to my knowledge and its cable appearances have the frequency of halley's comet
<START> other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinker br br this is the second film that i've seen in recent days directed by alexander korda the first was charles laughton's rembrandt it was so lousy that i shut it off this one i'm afraid is not very much better br br flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion robson states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit br br even a dashing laurence olivier can't save this utter piece of boredom br br future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really convey anything here to think that scarlett was 2 years later br br it's a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film
<START> r o b o t j o x br br burn the master br br grotesquely horrible br br no ending no closure br br completely and utterly the worst movie ever made br br replaces the adventures of pluto nash as the worst movie of all time br br i hate this utterly unacted unedited unscripted undirected unproduced mess of a thing called robot jox and i just found out they made a second one i apologize to adma sandler zohar the beauticin and eddie murphy pluto nash for hating their movies this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing this is the only movie for which i have ever said this remove it from netflix now 10 000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful
<START> this is a very strange film by director animator richard williams all who know of william's work know it's a bit off kilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cake br br it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls floppy and darned rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the camel with the wrinkled knees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silent movie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedy br br the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop and every second it's something new living in what was deemed the taffy pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart br br the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girl's toy blue though they didn't need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe i'm home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to br br this is a weird film with strange undertones but if that's what you're looking for you won't find better
<START> this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub titling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 years br br but then we briefly see a motor car late 30s early 40s style and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution br br which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant br br but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship br br maybe i'm reading too much into this film but i don't think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material br br but don't get me started on that
<START> three girls an all female media crew including cult actress barbara bach no less visiting a small town to cover a festival end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague well made little shocker suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue scenes and a rather thin plot line that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing as in vintage shock material and this is basically what the film thrives on performances cinematography are pretty much above par compared to many other late 70's early 80's films in the same vein but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax scene in the basement setting from the moment that keller junior character was introduced his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick who was funnily wacko in one flew over the cuckoo's nest and now utterly demented in the unseen take on one of the leading roles
<START> i just came back from the late night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real life black white images of the partition the freedom movement etc which was very much reminiscent of the lives' our forefathers faced amidst this backdrop mind you there was no tel fax internet in those times but for the very voice of truth non violence the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict raj br br gandhi shown as a hardworking attorney in south africa who stood for his basic ideologies and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with humility and sainthood which to the uttered speech of general smut was shown as a nice farewell on screen it had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour a veiled threat to the british raj in india there was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the british in india now that gandhi the politician is set for india towards sainthood br br the very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions little did harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father he tries to do away from mentor ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of gandhi's residence when harilal vents out his frustration in open this means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism with debt and dis obedience fuelling his negative thoughts he still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even gandhi's humble expressions form harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the father gandhi br br he couldn't digest the fact that gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected was driven to rebellion when he couldn't understand the equal merit based delivery of scholarship money by his father to his cousin where he saw a failed opportunity to study for barrister in england br br this had to take it's toll in him thrown to the streets as a beggar when the whole of india was celebrating the indepedence the life of a destitute never changes come what may but the manner in which the sad death of kasturba gandhi himself is shown brings in an emotional silence finally the last turbulent thoughts of the dying harilal is shown as a flashback to keep the audience gripping and wondering where did the father of the nation go wrong was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an one man army use his brave soldier son as a weapon to show to the british rival forces that when it comes to the interest of the nation nothing comes in between sadly though that to read a mahatma's heart one has to live outside his family and see which the emotionally naive harilal couldn't see living inside br br a pity that such naive harilal's are still ruining the efforts of many mahatma like fathers in many families in todays' life and have taken to drugs alcoholism and god knows what thoughts here's a message to all those brave sainik soldier sons please respect the father of the nation please obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting isn't it
<START> what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized this is the first filmed version of 'hamlet' to use the full text of shakespeare's play but branagh didn't do it just because it was there his intention i believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down so to speak in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain br br the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself the production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when you're watching a four hour movie branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play since so much of 'hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels battles etc this can be a daunting task but everything branagh tries to do seems to work br br branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor writer directors if not always the best since he made his big splash with 'henry v ' one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work let's face it 'hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if they've read the play hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination br br there are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time she looks to me like the finest young actress around other super performers in no particular order are richard briers nicholas farrell michael maloney and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz respectively honorable mention goes to julie christie charlton heston and robin williams who manages to do his thing here successfully even billy crystal as a gravedigger works the one cast member who doesn't inexplicably is jack lemmon in the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist br br not to be facetious when speaking of a four hour movie but it does seem just a tad too long some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if i may be so bold and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome br br did i forget anything other than patrick doyle's score no doubt i did i'll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'hamlet ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one
<START> an unqualified 10 the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old hollywood sam neill and meryl streep are very good together neill matches streep line for line and take for take it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms the movie which won several top awards in australia boasts not only a superlative cast and director but wonderful and authentic australian locales it proves that people are the same the world over and after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous streep line accent and all a dingo ate moy baby including that imp elaine benis on seinfeld
<START> the clichÃ© of the shell shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment pity a splendid cast acting to the limits of their high talents can't redeem 'the return of the soldier' from its stiff collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement best moments as another reviewer noted come when glenda jackson is on screen but even jackson's crackling good cinematic power can't pull this film's chestnuts from its cold never warmed hearth ann margret she of sex kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here despite her speaking with a nigh flawless middlesex accent the hackneyed score redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries' slathered on saccharine emotionalism is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script blocking and overbaked formalism of the direction except for its score and corseted script and direction 'the return of the soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together
<START> the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world planetoids bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen it is a world reminiscent of neverending story when the nothing came to eat the world away br br funny enough the villain here is the world gobbler as well this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who to my chagrin did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death br br the animation is great the voices and the sounds are top notch too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine they go to stop the world gobbler they reach him almost immediately they defeat him the end no real character development or story twists not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot br br bottom line it's a cute thing to watch kids would probably enjoy it but that's about it no depth to this world pun intended
