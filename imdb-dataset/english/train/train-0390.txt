<START> after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had Â£3 99 in my wallet thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie saw this and gave it ago i'm glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity brian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider man 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew's name and that made me get it and no his part isn't big at all it's very short at the very end of the film it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but it's watchable
<START> what a crime br br you forgot to brush your teeth let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do br br but don't forget uncle joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how mother would have done things if she were around br br yep full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it br br full house will not only bore you to tears but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would
<START> i hand't seen the restored or any version for that matter of baby face with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm what a great movie in a nutshell lily lives in a speakeasy she's been pimped out by her own father since she was 14 then his still blows up and he's killed leaving lily stanwyck alone cept for her black maid chico played very nicely by theresa harris lily leaves for the big city new york deciding to use her sex to get to the top she does this in great style br br she seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy one dumps his fiancÃ©e and kills his near father in law also lily's sugar daddy then commits suicide lily barely blinks stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is br br then in paris she falls for courtland played by george brent they marry but when he's in deep financial straights she bolts nearly free with chico and a half million she realizes she loved court lily races to find him but will she be too late br br this is pre code hollywood at its best stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect this reminded me of original sin with angelina jolie another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman those who disliked that films ultra romantic leanings will not like baby face any better those with belief in sex love and power will love it highly recommended see it
<START> this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i can't get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we'd never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work you'll love this show it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter react with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and that's what counts
<START> cosimo luis guzmÃ¡n is told in prison about a perfect heist since he's behind bars and can't do it himself he has to leave it to his girl rosalind patricia clarkson soon there are five guys organizing the crime five guys with very little brain capacity brothers anthony and joe russo are the directors of welcome to collinwood 2002 it's a crime comedy that's often very funny you can't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys there are some great actors playing these characters william h macy plays riley isaiah washington is leon sam rockwell is pero michael jeter is toto andy davoli is basil gabrielle union plays his love interest michelle jennifer esposito plays pero's love interest carmela george clooney also producer plays jerzy the tattooed guy in a wheelchair this is a highly entertaining flick i certainly recommend it
<START> i had mixed feelings for les valseuses 1974 written and directed by bertrand blier when i started watching it but i ended up liking it i would not call it vulgar dumb and dumber is vulgar the sweetest thing is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid i would call it shocking and offensive i can understand why many viewers especially the females would not like or even hate it it is the epitome of misogyny or so it seems and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they'd meet seems unspeakable but the more i think of it the more i realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem i am fascinated how blier was able to get away with it the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable it is well written the acting by all is first class and the music is sweet and melancholic actually when i think of it two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to they prepared a woman in the train the lovely docile blonde brigitte fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in renÃ© clÃ©ment's forbidden games 1952 at age 6 for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid marie ange miou miou exited and satisfied they enlightened and educated young and very willing isabelle huppert in one of her early screen appearances their encounter with jeanne moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level in short i am not sure i'd like to meet gÃ©rard depardieu's jean claude and patrick dewaere's pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but i had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew it was never boring
<START> there's nothing new for me to say 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill the cast was stellar but unfortunately the producer director editor god goofed he should have eaten humble pie if not for his own sake then for the men who died in kargil hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors hired a real scriptwriter hired a real editor hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of apocalypse now on some cheap indian drug hired a real professional crew thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story unfortunately he like the bigwigs of the indian army made decisions that were terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience we all died over and over br br please don't do that again sir sushma kathmandu nepal br br ps next time an indian director decides to glorify the gurkha regiment i suggest he hire more than one nepali to represent the team surely there are plenty of nepali men working in bombay last count was 40 000 to half a million
<START> i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started taking over the plane br br at first i thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more br br whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that br br this movie isn't worth a trip to blockbuster be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb ass br br if you want to be really scared i suggest the descent if you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash
<START> may the saints preserve us because this movie is not going to help br br someone with access needs to e mail mel gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of beowulf something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature br br the recent since 2000 versions of beowulf make we wonder two things first why is there so much interest in the story second why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap br br the only reason this got a two is that the version with lambert in it beowulf 2000 was worse and needed the 1 br br what is even worse some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem how can an industry where peter jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong i mean really the roman forum as a model for heorot is too much br br and please horns on helmets spare me this is insulting br br hjm
<START> seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio zombi fulci might be up to his old tricks unfortunately other than the close ups of a rotting corpse there's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's quest to figure out who killed him none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it that twist at least was cool you stop caring the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert
<START> so they hyped the violence and it's been branded as sick well the violence is the best bit i'm afraid but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their entirely predictable rampage this film has a truly dreadful script we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic the acting isn't much better either the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher the direction is clumsy the pace enough to send you to sleep and what on earth is the school film project all about a comment on the film itself perhaps the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable these guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i'll never know and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery absolutely awful beyond comprehension
<START> barbra streisand's first television special was simply fantastic from her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high fashion department store everything was top notch it was easy to understand how this special received awards br br not muddled down by guest appearances the focus remained on barbra thoughout the entire production
<START> tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself br br there are a few surprises as cynical as we are today i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave instead of his buddy's especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend' when she first meets matt and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr allen's face blinding him interesting role by bruce dern wrrrooonnnnggg some of the other hollywood endings do happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware br br and the music is out of this world taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago but at a club called wonderfully 'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks i'll be watching it again just to hear the music good thing i have the factotum sound track so i can listen to that in the car watch both together and you'll see how matt has matured playing bar room characters in both now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc he probably has great opportunity to do his studies great actor just coming into his own he shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study made especially poignant because of his bassett hound eyes he makes love convincingly as well since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen ager i wonder how that it making love to an actress you kinda grew up with adds conviction i'll say that
<START> to anyone who might think this show isn't for them please give it a try network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons learning what real friends and family are about and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires great name dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the main cast and they are all exceptional this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young sumpter's character learn and grow
<START> michael is king this film contains some of the best stuff mike has ever done smooth criminal is pure genius the cameos are wonderful but as always the main event is mj himself he is the best hands down
<START> strictly a routine by the numbers western directed by genre mainstay andrew v mclaglen so is that any wonder army colonel brian keith spars with smarmy bandit dean martin who has just kidnapped the colonel's wife honor blackman who never found her niche after playing pussy galore in goldfinger fist fights shoot outs stagecoach robberies and denver pyle in a supporting role in other words absolutely nothing new or original talking in a low monotone throughout keith gets to dally with a prostitute something of a shock after his run on tv's family affair but otherwise this low rent material wastes keith's amiable talents it's also bad news for dino who doesn't seem to notice or care hack direction poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor from
<START> i love a good war film and i fall into the been there done that category so i would like to think my review is an accurate one imho having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish there is no way i can recommend this film to you br br it started off with me shouting at the tv saying you wouldn't do that etc but i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud i was right br br there simply wasn't any logic to the eod scenes i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so i was left scratching my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractors br br the sniper scene was just so laughable it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience it started with the contact right and went down hill fast if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all you are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet br br then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh another scene where you just wanted it to end it added nothing to the film br br then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched it defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline it was senseless and awful i still don't understand why they wasted time on it then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter pure comedy br br the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death all i wanted was for it to end it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid senseless action ish scenes br br there is no way i can recommend this maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb rating which must be the 24 7 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good sorry folks it just ain't br br not recommended it will just bore you
<START> great acting great movie if you are thinking of building see this movie first the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt
<START> while leon is cute on snl he's only on for a minute like most snl skits to movies this one can't fill 90 minutes it has some cute moments the ones you've seen in the trailer but the actors are largely wasted tim meadows does his best but the plot just doesn't have many high points will farrell has a bit part farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie what a shame
<START> some spoilers as if you wouldn't know how it'll end br br my expectations for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue plus a very interesting theme invisibility every premise for a great movie was accomplished unfortunately these things didn't matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awfully predictable br br it's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility after the tests on animals succeeded kevin bacon decides to test it on himself once he's invisible he changes completely realizing the advantages of not being seen from this to murder there's a very thin line br br hollow man is an ill movie it suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the fx are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but that's not enough to make a movie good actually that's the problem with the movies today just like verhoeven most directors care only about spectacular scenes and nothing more the exceptions are very few and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot br br after starship troopers verhoeven disappoints again in stead of a great film hm is cr p there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1 the special effects 2 the joke with superman and wonder woman i won't spoil this moment for you br br okay so what went wrong with the movie everything let's see what i can remember br br it's not tensed at all it should've been but it's not br br it's too predictable you know from the beginning who will die and who will live br br in stead of focusing on the psychological part verhoeven cares only about the effects br br very many cliches br br of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying br br just like in every low quality horror the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible every time there is somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for bacon br br some holes in the plot example at the beginning bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab after he's invisible how can he do that br br the ending absolutely horrible br br after shue hits bacon in the head bacon falls down to the ground then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly without looking back is that normal then bacon gets up attacks them they kill him again and then shue screams i heard an explosion happened minutes ago and they suddenly run inside didn't she hear that explosion some time before br br there's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors come on mr verhoeven i expected much more from you br br so that's about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam br br vote 4 out of 10 for the special effects
