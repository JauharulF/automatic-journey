<START> the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because there's nothing else there to show br br gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film i don't really think they exist i think they bought this script at scripts r us where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blanks there's a monster stalking us let's split up they actually let's split up in this movie hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar not dead yet burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie ir glasses spraying with something like paint were handled badly br br what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it stunk br br i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i don't want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than
<START> 15 years ago power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations especially that of the youth when i was a 3 year old kid living in the philippines i would watch this show every friday on abs cbn channel 2 over there when the movie came out in 1995 it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and 2 uncles my grandparents even sent me a balikbayan box full of power rangers stuff including the easy to build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers i even played the video games and loved only one of them mmpr fighting edition which was really sad anyway it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series especially anime mech series like gundam now that i'm 18 i'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now to prove this i took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2 set dvd collection with mmpr the movie and turbo a power rangers movie and watched both of them i was like ugh how awful just another junk in the attic for me for all of you people of my generation this is not a show that you'd want to watch over and over again i'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life but occasionally is not a bad thing now is it instead of power rangers i'd recommend something like mobile fighter g gundam highly recommended ninja senshi tobikage aka ninja robots or even the original sentai shows that were the basis of power rangers
<START> i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor his character was entirely believable and i didn't think brad pitt at all br br unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny i'm an x files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as i'd thought it was made a few years later i like duchovny but found his character a little two dimensional here except where he's doing voice overs that part was strong seemed in character good intonation etc otherwise i kept thinking agent mulder which is a pity br br michelle forbes was a treat why haven't i noticed her before i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis this film and natural born killers a firm favourite interesting though to see a contrast of characters in nbk she's a willing accomplice whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early's dark side until it's thrust in her face br br i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly apart from duchovny's character not seeming fully formed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by pitt's it was perfect i was also pleased with the ending glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first it was realistic tense disturbing br br if you like nbk you may well like this movie and vice versa
<START> the premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that i'm a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low i'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 and some others many br br the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the acting well hmmm br br if one is a takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be miike's personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography br br the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the ground br br my suggestion is if you're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blue's harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china
<START> vampires sexy guys guns and some blood who could ask for more moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick gackt is the innocent sho who befriends a vampire kei hyde their relationship grows with time but as sho ages kei's immortality breaks his heart it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget it's a touching story ripe with human emotions you will laugh cry laugh then cry some more even if you are not a fan of their music see this film it works great as a stand alone vampire movie br br 9 out of 10
<START> i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out since i was a huge snl fan when my boyfriend and i went to see it the people coming out of the early show were yelling don't waste your money but of course we had to find out for ourselves br br while there were a few funny bits laser bra 2000 root boy slim most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show it was pretty bad br br when the opera singer came on many people got up and walked out this made me laugh because i realized that o'donoghue was just pressing people's buttons on purpose with this movie or else he was just insane whatever you don't need to waste your time watching it it's that bad
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival i loved this and not just for the obvious reasons blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of mount everest's sister peaks now this kind of thing is usually a can't miss inspirational moving pretty standard right and even if the film were just that i'd still have liked it but it was so much more blind herself german sabriye tenberken established a school for blind children in tibet in a culture that sees blindness as a curse as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives and at best are a burden to their families as part of their education tenberken shares with them the story of american erik weihenmayer the first blind person to reach the summit of mount everest she sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students instead he comes up with a plan he'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23 000 foot lhakpa ri and provide all the guides and equipment sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts br br erik's team are mostly american mostly male and mostly sighted as experienced mountaineers they're type a personalities very gung ho and goal oriented sabriye is european female and blind and the students for her are more than a project no matter how well intentioned additionally the students are tibetan and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves as the expedition unfolds they become pawns in between the two adult sides wanting to please both while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment as an additional obstacle other than being blind that is they are speaking english as a second or in most cases a third language and struggle to understand and make themselves understood br br when it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience and that some are much more coordinated than others it begins to unravel erik's original plan for them all to reach the summit together as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults at the risk of oversimplifying on one side are those for whom the destination is all and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey i won't tell you how it all turns out except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought provoking stories i've seen in a long time br br the film also weaves bits of each climber's story into the narrative and this was sorely needed since once on the climb the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut with all the drama going on around them that wasn't surprising the backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end this was contrary to my expectations and another pleasant surprise br br in addition to all the human drama to cover director walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen deprived conditions herself lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down as with all great documentaries the filmmaker was just lucky enough or smart enough or prepared enough to be at the right place at the right time and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do what's best for the kids as it does about the kids themselves
<START> now my friends films like la bÃªte aka the beast or o monstro only can be done in the old continent in this film we see all horses dirty sex nymphomaniac kind off gorilla non sense dialogs etc etc etc in the serious terms now its an allegory that men sometimes could be bestial visceral and brutal walerian borowczyk the director shows us the loss of innocence sexual violence rape and brutality its a astonishing cinematic experience bizarre and full of grotesque scenes for all fans of european shocking exploitation i recommend this film if you like this one i recommend orloff against the invisible man and alterated states
<START> this schiffer guy is a real genius the movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and educating br br i didn't know what a weather girl was before i learned it here
<START> but i got over it to me it seemed that even the author of the book favored caroline i felt so sorry for the character louise and she was constantly compared with esau who was evil i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un realistic really though the movie was bad i wouldn't really see it unless you're ready for a big let down
<START> truly terrible pretentious endless film director bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress detmers and who can blame him but maybe just maybe he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good engaging film i hate it when a sex film poses as an art film just to become more respectable the frequent occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste
<START> the premise while not quite ludicrous was definitely ridiculous what should have occurred by the second encounter with tritter was that tritter should simply be wasted house hires some guy and de physicalizes tritter in real life tritter would have been hauled up for harassment the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court providing motive and opportunity and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of tritter and the particular department he worked for he would be in prison as would anyone complicit in the harassment of house chase foreman cameron wilson and cuddy the lawsuit would have won house a tasty settlement enough to keep him supplied with vicadin well into his old age while tritter would wind up somewhere driving a cab trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled to the fact that they'd seen it all before
<START> this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions dreams and startling images its effect is both beautiful and unsettling the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare sorry dali fans
<START> what can be said really the tenant is a first class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full blown paranoia it's an intricately plotted film every detail seems included for a reason even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanski a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartment warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu k on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score it's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it
<START> wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls script pacing and direction are uniformly awful action sequences defy belief characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields' character as well as graphic deaths br br the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a children's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities it also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an indian spiritual movie a travelogue and a western the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon that it manages to do just fine
<START> this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the 3d was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this movie br br the story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is not br br i would have liked to see more special 3d effects also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting
<START> the story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details writing directing continuity pacing action sequences stunts and use of cg all cheapen and spoil the film br br first off action sequences they are all quite unexciting most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004 br br the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used br br pacing everything happens too quickly for example elle is trained to fight in a couple of hours and from the start can do back flips etc why is she so acrobatic none of this is explained in the movie as lilith she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back flips maybe she couldn't since she had wings br br also we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror and then stabbing herself in the throat all for no apparent reason and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car are you okay asks the driver yes i'm fine she says bloodied and disheveled br br i watched it all though because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting but in the end the poor execution made me wish for anything else blade vampire hunter d even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief but this just made me want to shake the director awake and give the writer a good talking to
<START> stylish moody innovative revenge driven bloodbath also cheesy of course and sporadically very cheesy it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy it's sad there's no gloria grahame but so fantastic that it's alain delon and not glenn ford could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat yet he's totally tough and icy cool no one nowadays can touch him though someone like jude law could try i guess hard for any girl to look good with him the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases and those aren't generally my cup of tea especially one willy nilly one in the woods people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion for instance in a junkyard cruncher but beyond the cheese the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off more creativity excitement and freshness in that forgotten movie than most of what i've seen lately
<START> i had heard and read so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like entourage sopranos or mad men but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one didn't make it past the first six episodes br br the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh br br the characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing i absolutely hated the addition of the brother in law who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator and the removal of the hodes' daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clichÃ© i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty br br episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line br br add to that i heard that season two wasn't as good so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out br br if you're a fan of good casting and writing i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course you're stoned and then all bets are off
<START> hrm i think that line was from the old movie posters br br this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator here's a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future is going to be fun this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you br br in this case in the future means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well that's never terribly clear but it's probably something really important there are good guys obviously capitalists i e us and bad guys commies and there are big stop motion robots br br sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end the space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget br br with said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into and i'm not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks i can always get a laugh in a bar by re enacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads br br like i said it's dumb that's why i bought the tape
