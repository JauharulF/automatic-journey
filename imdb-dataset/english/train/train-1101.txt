<START> i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well done br br some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i'd give the film an 8 out of 10
<START> this film is a great fun i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time but they all thanked me and loved the movie you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie br br i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri's level but no where near the same size ring he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a a group where everyone trusts everyone else he would sponsor only people who seemed very well to do who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k in 1987 when that was real money after being in town for only 1 month his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face br br the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor but i don't want to give anything away br br i just found this one night on a late night movie channel showtim i think this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them a thing it is a very entertaining film it moves quickly and never bores you br br this should be a international classic for all time i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top time will be very good to this film i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet in some ways that makes the surprises even better br br the director and editor were fantastic they deserved winning the best documentary br br just watch this film
<START> the only redemption was the small part by larry miller it seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be something about mary but i didn't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards the actor who plays paul was great but selma blair is stuck in the stupidity of her cruel intentions character james brolin was great but paul's father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the randy quaid character from the national lampoon's vacation movies
<START> the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked late night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that when we do get to a point it is so monumentally moronic that i kept thinking i must have misunderstood it but i didn't br br sean tells the story of an osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so didn't realise they were sharing his friend asks but what about the weekends sean doesn't have an adequate explanation sean then tells the story of his own similar problem which is that he isn't sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other this has been going on for three weeks but his friend doesn't ask yes but as i said before what about the weekends you must see her then it doesn't make sense what are you going on about sean are you on medication or something but let's be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week br br we see sean checking to see if the soap and towels have been used in fact bizarrely he starts to carry the soap around with him but what about his girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo sanpro and moisturiser toothpaste and toothbrush let's go to the kitchen what about food and drink is any missing has any been bought in the bedroom has the shared bed been made or not are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones is the laundry basket fuller in the toilet is the seat up or down i mean good grief br br and to cap it all paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home why doesn't he just phone her br br but it gets worse in the last act although no one told vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them lenny's love interest and sean's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group there isn't even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences br br to be fair the dialogue is ok but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame story br br i heard one of actors interviewed and he promised no guns no drugs no corsets i thought great but after half an hour of tedium i was yelling at the screen i want guns i want drugs i want corsets br br it wouldn't have taken much to sort these problems out but on the official website the director boasts that the film wasn't script edited that's all you need to know
<START> this is not a good movie it's disjointed all the acting is bad and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away worst of all no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she can't sing but who cares she's sooooo damn good looking but i digress nothing new here bottom line hot girl group gets taken advantage of some one gets hooked on drugs someone gets hooked on a guy some one gets the hell out and then the horrible stuff happens surprise surprise welcome to the music business i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies i don't play that if you want to support these films by going to see them great if you enjoyed it super to each his own but don't try to tell me it was good pleeeease i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors wanna see a good african american movie see love jones ray or the color purple those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin why because they told compelling stories with great acting that made you feel something long after you left the theater just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film it's only good when it's good period
<START> a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids as a matter of fact with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces at least for continuity's sake br br speaking of ann sheridan she is the one true shining light of this movie to paraphrase a clichÃ© ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd br br another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan unfortunately this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background for a better example of the sheridan reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row
<START> it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any gray matters will agree that this movie just doesn't work br br the problems lay in the direction cast selections and lack of depth in the character building the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used let's look at the problems in direction script br br brother and sister both in their mid 30's seem to be well adjusted they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week's time hello does anyone feel stupid yet he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her not only was there no chemistry it just doesn't make sense sure it's a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could but the direction made it completely flat br br now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan very shallow character kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role br br this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction
<START> about five minutes in and i saw where this was heading bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the school's administration and thoughts of rebellion start fomenting i said to my girlfriend if it gets below a 5 on imdb i'll go and read a book it got 5 0 so she persuaded me to go on watching what are the good things well it is a good thing this film does not have a story because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing it's like the student's drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meat grinder and left half the stock destroyed with the other half spliced into two second bits even in a ten second scene of the local tv news there are about six cuts and three different angles and then there are the montages these are all set to electronic music which forewarns you of yet another montage so that like pavlov's dog you start cringing every time you hear it which is about every three minutes oh i was supposed to say what's good about this film well the film was shot very well with a nice color palette that nicely matched the emotional content such as there was of the scenes okay now with the film's major flaw and it wasn't the story or lack thereof the director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations not by clever storytelling but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters that's just cheating i guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable but it just became plain annoying if the story is full of holes it's no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer and often there wasn't even any point to it and then the ending basically the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy if a coward plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie that you should stand up for a just cause on its head by the already mentioned misdirection and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions that was already made and much better by animal farm it also committed what i call the bill cosby sin no matter how things may seem at first in the end adults are always right and children always wrong and let's face it unless you're me that's just not true
<START> prom night 2 is an ok horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom queen mary lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge the best actor in this movie is micheal ironside and the movie stars other ok actors and actress like justin louis i wendy lyon lisa schrage and richard monette i and there are some good gore scenes like when mary lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and mary lou electrocutes him to death over all this is an ok good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10
<START> a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks ish influence in director dahl nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do j t walsh rip to a great actor is always a wonderful villain as is dennis hopper it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz i'm sure he has his followers though in all this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film
<START> okay so the plot is on shaky ground yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song and or dance sequences for example adam's concert and henri's stage act and leslie caron can't really um you know act br br but somehow 'an american in paris' manages to come through it all as a polished first rate musical largely on the basis of gene kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron he needs to because she seems to have a problem with emoting br br the most accomplished and technically awe inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16 minute ballet towards the end of the film it's stunningly filmed and kelly and caron dance beautifully but my favourite number would have to be kelly's character singing 'i got rhythm' with a bunch of french school children then breaking into an array of american dances it just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real talent br br not on the 'classics' level with 'singin' in the rain' but pretty high up there nonetheless worth the watch
<START> this movie is one long chiche after another first of all though they did their share there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot the wigs and accents are terrible they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons john is the nasty envious closet homosexual slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the two of us john would not have been mean to his fans like this either like his death showed us he was too nice if anything the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday an insulted john says something along the lines of sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees put on your wife's wig and lick my liggin that made me laugh for days really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here forget it
<START> there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie but can't really do that can i this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee i'm serious don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality and everything else associated with nature being a woman and that might not even be a factor i can watch this movie over and over again trey parker and matt stone are absolutely brilliant along with all their other debuts i think baseketball is the prize winner i'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie watch the movie that's all i'm going to say it's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because i'm one of those people like ozzy osbourne who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak so i'm keeping it professional best movie heck yeah
<START> really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace via drug addiction and later redemption one brother a self proclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man child the other brother is a hard working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about i'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love
<START> wow br br this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 9 11 01 in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outlets br br those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside br br it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one br br in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower two's subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forget br br heart rending tear jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 9 11 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made br br we must never forget br br
<START> what a muddled mess i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open minded to the many wonders of cinema but this sure isn't one of them br br while there very well could be some good ideas concepts and there are certainly some good performances under the circumstances it is all buried under random nonsense sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration say what you want about david lynch but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness br br his quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all it's not worth your money bandwidth or time
<START> you know the rest if you want a good zombie movie don't rent this movie if you want a documentary esquire look at hood life you're at the wrong place as well if you're looking for a laughable piece of film this is a real winner the acting is as flat as a piece of paper the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive by i can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice if i could hear a cardboard box talk it'd probably sound like this guy oh yea and the zombies did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall note sarcasm how did this not win an oscar for best make up the quiroz did not do any sort of directing i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece the period is more like 1990's la the direction is however one uped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie i haven't heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie f k since ice grill which was another urban thriller this only works of course in conjunction with the also epic hip hop soundtrack all 3 or so songs of it all in all what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled hood of the living dead i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene and boy it delivered and more i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror yea right movie for the night a memorable experience for sure
<START> ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music it's wrong on so many fronts that it's laughable tommy quickly the honeycombs the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group two by the animals and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout all 1 20 but all in all an awkward display of british music circa 1964 oh and herman's hermits
<START> the film portrays france's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western francophone africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman france herein symbolically representing her nation it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past in particular and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling or being in transit from the present to the past remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities br br the characters all play a symbolic albeit a limited and unconvincing role france meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naivetÃ© she enjoyed as a child in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality the rest of the rag tag ensemble is just forgettable the black africans are to say the least offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe like france wonders seeking a world she never knew and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon
<START> creepshow 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavy handed still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for it's periodic lulls resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just lingers there br br as in the original all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts a wooden indian comes to life wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a textbook example of unmotivated by the numbers filmmaking it doesn't help that this cheap looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasn't much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much br br for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the ill fated general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy lamour on the other hand is quite good as the guilt ridden motorist evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall br br one would think that creepshow 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen king's stories makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didn't really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels clones rip offs and whatnot so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we can't blame him br br rating 1 2 out of br br released by new world pictures
