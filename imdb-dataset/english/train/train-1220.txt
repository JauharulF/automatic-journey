<START> william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music recruiting poster vivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman george cukor the women's director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of air corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime sure the gee whiz and entirely white save for one unbilled chinese american recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn't reemerge for years lon mcallister edmond o'brien martin ritt red buttons in drag as an andrews sister peter lind hayes karl malden kevin mccarthy gary merrill lee j cobb and don taylor also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried sick brooklyn spouse too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm evidently after twentieth century fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the army and if there's a good 35mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon it's disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
<START> this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasn't convincing br br its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks don't look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time br br a pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
<START> for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate there is the duo of the second renaissance shorts i'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts especially since they're credited as one on the dvd and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd but they're informative even if they have a few gaps br br what really makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animations as well is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights graphic homages to slavery fascism concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and humanity's god complex in fact god is never really referenced by these shorts instead replaced by man's own image br br as far as the shorts go in the collection the second renaissance part i is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion it's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become the architect of its own destruction some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature but then again that's basically what most of the matrix series has done and it's been a driving force behind its success br br polarisdib
<START> sean you know i think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world but i can't commend you for this comedy just isn't your strong suit br br however it wasn't all your fault some of the stuff was just too hard to understand alfred lynch did a decent job but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning br br once again sean i apologize
<START> the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested as often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive in screens claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook who worked in films for years this one's quite hard to find anymore i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day but don't remember particularly impressed way back when chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u s theatres and video but oh that one sheet still a gem of my later horror collection
<START> pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well most people may avoid this but they should check it out
<START> i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word which i normally don't use lightly wonderful in my view the best movie ever made who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film when everything that is said and left unsaid throughout the story is drawn together just as the character of daniel dareus evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him the movie does the same to its viewers you walk out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full great stuff next time you ask yourself what is the meaning of life perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven happy content fulfilled to say it with virginia woolf's mrs dalloway such moments are enough
<START> when i read the summary of the movie something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength i though that was clever and original concept casting was promising too carrey freeman aniston how can movie with a good idea and good actors not to mention costs of filming can be bad it can idea is good but script and story itself is terrible bruce nolan is let's be honest a pretty mediocre journalist with not exactly great stories like a story of a giant cookie what a faux pas and the niagara report is complete fiasco he's a man with a job he completely deserves he's not a good journalist he's a comedian considering his potentials with a nice home sugar sweet girlfriend and oh horror dog who is not house trained yes as soon as bruce at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a god why do you hate me manner average viewer must think why what's wrong with your life bruce bruce is not and definitely not the man with real problems in life most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity most people have really big problems worth of attention most people are more worth of attention that bruce who doesn't seem too human after all doesn't look even realistic too goofy and neurotic but god still addresses to him why though morgan freeman looks nice as a god i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference no wait a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce what does bruce do pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere parts the red soup lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street answers prayers via e mail and make all of them come true no more bruce please what bruce did could actually end the world but in the movie that doesn't happen because this is nice family little movie and doesn't make any sense at all not a hint of sarcasm of real humor of wittiness of some dirty humor at least nothing just carrey playing silly which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor aniston here is understated she plays pale undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace and stays completely forgettable in this movie nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic but completely false these two are not meant to be together i would give three stars but i doubt movie deserves a one bad script lame dialogs lack of real humor wittiness and any sophistication as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles total lack of boldness and sarcasm it all makes movie hardly worth but ok there were few funny moments and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so lets leave three stars
<START> savage island 2003 is a lame movie it's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched i don't know why this movie was made i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood boil the situations were inane at best if i made a movie like this it would have been a short really because those backwood idjits wouldn't have been in the picture br br don't be fooled by the cover on the d v d i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable i don't mind movies being shot on d v but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror films sans wrong turn br br i have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by br br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1
<START> i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and or have little sense of elegance first to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together modern sensibilities demand great drama no i don't mean great setting of characters and plots but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic this is a subtle movie its beauty lies in its subtlety not to be confused with simplicity neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness politics human weakness venality you name it the world it's set in would be alien and not understood today a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly even if you only think you have it br br many people today don't understand that victorian society wasn't really victorian as people understand that term today br br this movie helps set the record straight
<START> i can't recommend this film as a date movie gary oldman's semi autobiographical account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent beckettian account of one of dante's circles of hell frankly at the centre of it is ray winstone who has done this sort of character before but never as well the film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar that's all and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration self loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie it's an acting masterclass br br of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and winstone is matched by kathy burke as his long suffering wife who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour charlie creed miles does an able turn as the fuse lighting druggie son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for gary oldman directs close up on the actors maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor 4 10
<START> this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard we had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel surfed to hbo during the course of the evening someone by the name of eddie izzard was on i tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes i didn't want to be held responsible for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me after holding in my laughs for more than was healthful i let go as did the others of us we were not stoned by the way nor talking of insurance and pensions we were asphyxiated after that the story lines the plot the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance i have since been addicted to every eddie izzard piece of comedy i can get my hands on his work is sheer genius his comedy appears effortless he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that it's convulsively funny he gives you the impression that the joke is between you and himself the only true aficionados of humor after all if you are disappointed in this video you have no sense of the penultimate in humor or humour as they say in the uk
<START> well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it's greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself br br great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i don t like them much br br terrific
<START> 20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter tom oakley the boy william beech is billeted with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night william is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness it transpires that william has a talent as an artist and we see tom's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of jerusalem william is befriended by zacharias wrench a young jewish lad also from london and along with both tom and zacharias he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community just as he is settling down william is recalled back to london by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up his mother is clearly mentally sick and when tom doesn't hear from william he travels to london to look for him he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar after a period in hospital tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him the climax is a bitter sweet ending when william is told he is to be adopted by tom while at the same time learning his best friend zacharias has been killed in an air raid in london for me one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home office br br i love 'im an' for what it's worth i think he loves me too' br br it just doesn't get better that that does it
<START> there's so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here's a side you haven't heard yet br br elvis presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i don't have to think when i watch them that means i don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all br br in my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it's good category now if you're like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience it's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it 1 out of 10 though once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic
<START> if john waters had written and directed house of 1000 corpses after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed it's mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives cutlery and pliers susan adriensen sno cakes is incredibly annoying and terry west elvis bullion is almost as bad in whatever it is he's doing in front of the camera br br maybe the best thing about the blood shed is that it won't take most viewers very long to forget about it
<START> the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3 4 star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to do bring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniro's character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane's character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison br br this genre has been more successfully handled by nobody's fool in the mid 90s and this year's 2003 about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts br br i'll give it an a for effort
<START> as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film online i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story br br this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp dumb and dumber or blood and guts this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting br br i would prefer this movie to many a rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings br br i highly recommend this movie
<START> it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels the script the acting the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling the costumes sets and pseudo medieval language are also utterly awful in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise albeit not very believable but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films let's just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better oh and david thewlis' haircut makes him look like he man it does
<START> mainly because ju on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju on and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film ho hum i found that deeply irritating as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff not to mention dull having to watch it all over again br br ok that complaint aside the byline for ju on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over 36 minutes simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline br br there are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop and some of the questions raised by the original some but not all are answered br br so in conclusion if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes
