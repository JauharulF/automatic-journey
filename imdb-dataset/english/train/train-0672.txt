<START> the first side story in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes br br the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christina br br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam series br br normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas br br in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
<START> i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of just a mish mash of other far better sword sorcery epics lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy mildly amusing in it's ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it's worst lucio fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows br br my grade d br br dvd extras posters stills galleries lucio fulci bio and us international theatrical trailers br br eye candy sabrina siani is topless throughout some may consider that appealing i did not various extras are topless as well
<START> this movie is my all time favorite you really have to see michael jackson in this wonderful film i'm always over the moon watching it this is a film that you really have to see also if you aren't a mj fan cause this film writes like captain eo e t and ghosts a bit of film and music history this wonderful film out of michael's feather is a must have and smooth criminal is really the most wonderful exciting and amazing song i've ever heard in my life thank you michael for this film and i love you mj's the best musician to hit this planet he's a fine man and he always brings sparkles in your eyes when you listen to his music please if you don't know this film watch it and don't miss it because would be too bad for yourself if you'd miss it highly recommanded film for every movie lover
<START> well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick it's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6 week that's my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it lyle and alvin don't even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten
<START> well i guess i'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema helping me through my master's thesis or rather keeping me from working on it br br but on watching it again several years and many many movies later what a well crafted little gem this is i've never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley where does one meet such a man sigh sophie thompson's turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest oh napkins sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect impossible couple br br of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood almost hobbiton like atmosphere of the movie although as far as cinematography and art decoration go it's almost a case of visual overload very very pretty but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period but the good thing is the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun and some pretty cool editing that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode br br my particular favorite is the ball scene some beautiful acting and directing here and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long cut two shots i can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie br br gosh i just realize by reading the imdb listings that i've seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him seems he's got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob hmm guess i need to pay my video store a visit br br lovely movie my favorite jane austen adaptation so far though perhaps ang lee's sense and sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart and i've certainly seen it many more times watch it if you can and don't be too hard on its little imperfections br br
<START> i am a huge john denver fan i have a large collection of his music on vinyl i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it i have the original vinyl album and cd i have the original cd and later release the later release is missing several songs though i see that it has been released this year with all original songs to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at 75 00 wow to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much to me no amount is worth selling this treasure it is my favorite christmas cd i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd i would love to have either version if anyone has one available please let me know thanks
<START> it has been so many years since i saw this but i do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast it br br it is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here that is what humour does i suppose it is subjective it either charges through your funny bone at 60 000 volts or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it the time br br this show has some of britain's best comic actors put together in a story that is silly and irreverent and the outcome is hilarious the dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads cleese and lowe are superb together this was made for them br br i can't really say anymore other than to implore you to find this and watch it you won't be disappointed and in a world devoid of genteel humour this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance
<START> i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasn't entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think it's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists br br rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthy's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated i've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madness br br on the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess i'm just the kind of person that believes that i'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you don't want goldsworthy talk about his art while you're watching the film feel free to turn the sound off that's like not reading the lyrics if you don't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself br br i think that andy goldsworthy's work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and i'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthy's work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthy's art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow moving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
<START> thank god this wasn't based on a true story because what a story it is populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds before the devil is a mesmerizing jaw dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable and sometimes is even with or perhaps because of the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout if it weren't carried out with such magnificent overwhelming conviction by its stars the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either br br the main dysfunction here is of a family nature with the two majorly screwed up brothers brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store an attempt that goes pathetically awry br br the story is told with time shifts which are noted on screen such as charlie two days before the robbery so no one should be confused some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life throw in these cheesy extra tidbits one of the brothers is a drug addict married to gina marisa tomei also excellent who is having an affair with the other brother toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father a wrenching performance from albert finney who has apparently caused him serious past pain and you've got a shakespearean greek tragedy on your hands proceed with caution
<START> this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he kill'em all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro life valerie on the stairs i don't remember the argento's episode in season 1 etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i don't know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking
<START> first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene she's involved in i've seen most of the rest of sarno's films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best sarno's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see co stars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum and chris jordan both frequent co stars of ms welles and also frequent stars of sarno's work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives this film is sarno classic
<START> unfortunately this movie is so bad the original out of towners was manic and very funny of course they used the script written by neil simon for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again even the audience i was with never laughed the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i e the couple having sex in the park they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie steve do a bit of slap stick the whole movie winds up being like this a joke is set up and given away why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie you will also notice every close up of goldie they use a very intense soft lens i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis that's if you want to laugh
<START> after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted br br 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichÃ©d story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker br br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that br br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall br br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house br br once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the point br br the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship br br although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isn't worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but it's worth a rental and it's definitely worth watching for free
<START> i used to review videos for joe bob briggs' legendary we are the weird newsletter i saw a lot of stinkers but this by far was the worst and the years have not been kind it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed don't get me wrong caged terror is nominally more technically competent than say monster a go go or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension is it a vietnam commentary an ecological protest an incitement to race riot a study of man's inhumanity to man a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to nearly feature length in short a hep young urban professional possibly the most loathesome screen character ever somehow seduces a nubile asian american associate into camping in the woods with him after brow beating her with quasi philosophical clap for the better part of an hour they run across two wandering veterans the unforgettable jarvis a righteous brother and the troubadour guitar toting manson family reject hey a plot twist tension action suspense well no just a climactic getting locked in a makeshift wire chicken coop and lightly belittled scene the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters no no please don't meanwhile jarvis addresses the troubadour as trouby once every two minutes bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquer's pod people that's about all that happens in caged terror and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable but trust me i've seen thousands of movies in my life and this one has remained for the past eight years since i first saw it the absolute worst i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself and reassure myself i certainly do i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this very little happens and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really really want to shove some kind of message down your throat but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort this film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours it's terrible truly truly terrible folks trust me i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse go see it you'll thank me and curse me just for the record my favorite line in caged terror but perhaps ever yeah well you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christ's love for the church note must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension
<START> how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life
<START> burt kennedy used to be a very good director but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess not only does this film look cheap it is cheap most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior the last command from 1955 and that footage shot 32 years previously looks more contemporary than anything in this picture the few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized confused and incompetent looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture this has the look and feel of a bad student film and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more it moves like molasses the acting for the most part is either over the top ham or under the top comatose although raul julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies on top of that it's way too long if you're going to make a boring film do it in an hour or so and get it over with don't stretch it out over three hours like this one does if you want to see a good movie about the alamo check out john wayne's 1960 version or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy skip it
<START> this has to be the all time best computer animation classic even though most of the animations where experiments they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time twelve years after it's release i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored
<START> the quintessential road movie if your idea of a road movie involves three would be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani well one out of four ain't bad a no talent magician with an eye for showmanship max watches a very skilled pickpocket hugo plying his trade in new york after convincing hugo that he max is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not so dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions milo and the ah gentler attributes of a lovely waitress lydia the unlikely four pile into a van obtained by hugo you guess where it came from and head to vegas havoc ensues anyhow it's funny it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good a solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected
<START> the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn't for the squeamish especially the director's cut which was originally given an nc 17 rating br br 1 2 out of
<START> first to die 2003 br br i'll admit my mistake first i didn't realize this was a made for tv movie i was thrown off by the r certification the plot is strong but the movie is about 40 minutes too long the direction and continuity were excellent for the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters the down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the chick flick genre although there are some violent scenes none of the violence should call for an r rating there is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes actually there are no sex scenes ona grauer who is absolutely beautiful kristina copeland sonya salomaa and glynis davies were all guests on the sg 1 series but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses robert patrick was fantastic as he usually is and mitch pileggi made me think of a modern day lee marvin the very talented megan gallagher who i came to respect as an actor during the millennium series was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities the greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was tracy pollan aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive her voice is absolutely annoying i found myself muting the tv during her dialogue i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the lifetime tv type of programs i would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however considering i found nothing that would cause censorship this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on tv since nothing will be cut out as a tv movie i would rate this as a 5 out 10 as a feature film with an r certification and such as strong cast i rate it as a 2 out of ten
