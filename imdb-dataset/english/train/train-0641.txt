<START> i watched this last night on tv hbo i have to admit that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic ahh yes the dames the villians the cigars and thuggish cops it has it all this movie delivered all the goods to me i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot very common for this era of movie very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre
<START> i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget now my take on things br br the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way the fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets they may not look as fancy but at least they interact just look at peter jacksons early films br br as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where br br the script seemed confused to me one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech i'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person br br i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents br br in short this film is a very slightly polished turd but a turn none the less
<START> although too young to remember the first showing of the series being just a baby i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era with mixed opinions the british television stations are generally very good at producing these as the world at war can easily attest with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies i strongly recommend such titles as the nazis a warning from history blitz and the bbc series about dunkirk britain at war in colour with its companion series japan germany and america are of a very high standard the world at war is by far the best and despite its age never fails to deliver there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other even if such an undertaking was even possible what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research and make it enjoyable that certainly worked for me i now have a very comprehensive library of books videos dvds and tapes and cds recommend to anyone with even a passing interest the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative
<START> i've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraw's in this movie god is she bothersome or what she says everything in the same tone and is horrible so horrible in fact that by contrast ryan o'neal is brilliant br br there is not much of a story he's rich she's wooden they both have to sacrifice a lot for love his father is stonewall jackson hers is called by his first name in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love br br the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year john marley is fine as wooden's father but a supporting nomination at least ali didn't win br br i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer but then again if it were up to me katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies she's certainly a better actress than mcgraw br br i didn't even cry when she got sick never occured to me to even feel sad br br it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15 and the score is good but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long and the sin of that is its not that old but it feels it
<START> first of all i ain't american or middle eastern second of all i don't have a religion the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies henceforth i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias br br most of these short films are an utter disgrace this dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by some barbaric and uncivilized morons instead most of what i saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points examples br br 1 ken loach's segment sure we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001 two wrongs don't make a right whatever this film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean english accent br br 2 most disturbing is youssef chahine's segment it is obvious that he has trouble with logic he justified the murders due to america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle east helloooo is this guy for real some americans don't even vote some americans don't even know where the middle east is some don't even know what religion is practiced there and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes mr chahine the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world the murdered firefighters rescuers office workers by standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics and yet we are not allowed to go about our lives because some people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics br br 3 the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda sometimes it is not about you some people always think about the me me me sometimes it is about other people br br 4 idrissa ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer they obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty blah blah blah br br this movie denigrates the memory of sept 11th 2001 victims br br the best thing for it is the trash can
<START> this movie is probably for you it had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often clichÃ© things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots if you're familiar with buddhism that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film the impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc however what i did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing i saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing you only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends
<START> this 1984 version of the dickens' classic a christmas carol ' directed by clive donner stars george c scott as ebenezer scrooge by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative especially scott one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen scott do it simply put he is scrooge and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well to be able to make a character so real from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face and to make it all ring so true it's a study in perfection br br the other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance and they do frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley a notable turn though not as memorable perhaps as the one by alec guinness as marley in the film scrooge ' angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come br br david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on film br br the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees fred holywell and also the narrator of the film caroline langrishe janet holywell lucy gutteridge belle michael gough mr poole and joanne whalley fan a flawless presentation this version of a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged no matter how many versions you may have seen watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c scott a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home i rate this one 10 10
<START> it's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it although 18 different international directors took the challenge not everyone of them is good some of them even boring but in his entity paris je t'aime is breathtaking showing that as love actually put it 'love is all around' especially in the city of love here's a resumÃ© i'll try to make at as spoiler free as possible of the 18 different stories br br montmartre kind of a dull opening sequence nothing really special about it a man finds a parking spot and sees a lot of odd couples walking by wondering why he can't find a girl and than suddenly a woman faints next to his car br br quais de seine another dull sequence about three teenage boys who are searching for some 'piece of ass' when suddenly a muslim girl trips right in front of them receiving help from one of the boys really basic but with a sweet heart to it br br les marais this was a huge disappointment although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great van sant eventually everything that comes after the monologue by ulliel is good everything before it is just annoying br br tuileries an entertaining sequence by the coen brothers buscemi without even saying one word is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious this one kept me hooked until the very end and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie br br loin du 16ieme a beautiful story too even if the execution is poor the heart is there it's the story of an hispanic woman who drops her child off early in the morning to take care of another suburban baby beautiful br br porte de choisy this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a chinatown lookalike place in paris if i understood it correctly the story is about inner beauty but i think i'm wrong br br bastille a truly wonderful sequence a man meets with his wife at a restaurant to break up with her so that he can run off with his mistress but the wife has some devastating news pretty basic but truly sad and beautiful place des victoires a sad sequence as well juliette binoche plays a grieving mother one night she wakes up hearing her dead child when she arrives at the location a cowboy tells her she can give one last good bye to her child one of the best segments tour eiffel two mimes who fall in love could have been great but even though it has some nice cinematic tricks the story isn't intriguing and not funny at all br br parc monceau a truly original and great sequence one of the best of the movie a young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man cuaron does a great directing job and the actors are amazing quartier des enfants rouges an american actress gyllenhaal falls in love with her drug dealer a beautiful segment again with a very sad ending place des fetes a woman comes to a homeless man he starts talking romantic to her because she is the love of his life beautiful sad shocking romantic place des fÃªtes will make everyone cry br br pigalle a boring sequence between ardant and hoskins who are looking for new thrills in their relationship very unfunny and unromantic pigalle is a let down br br quartier de la madeleine bringing some diversity in the movie qdlm is a relief a young guy wood finds a vampire killing a victim the tourist and the vampire fall in love dark scary and oddly romantic madeleine is superb br br pere lachaise another let down segment directed by wes craven and with stars as mortimer and sewell it could have been great but pÃ¨re lachaise is just ordinary not original at all br br faubourg saint denis the rumors are true twyker's short film is beautiful stunning and well done a blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman truly stunning that she breaks up with him he reflects on their relationship br br quartier latin even though this segment has been co directed by depardieu and has such stars as rowlands gazzara and depardieu this segment is a let down too nothing happens lack of chemistry between the actors br br 14th arrondissement the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time an american tells in her french class about her trip to paris her french is truly terrible but at the end of the segment she realizes that paris is so much more than meets the eye br br with feist on the background paris je t'aime ends in a sweet tone not letting me down at all even though some segments bored the hell out of me the entity of the movie is great a true cinematic experience for young and old paris je t'aime vraiment
<START> moonstruck is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time now it is one of my all time favorites br br the humor is subtle but really good the film offers a lot of warmth humor the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch this film is by far the best job nicholas cage has done on film the old man character is fantastic he lights up the screen without saying a word the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic but perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis br br the film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen exceptional direction and wrap up
<START> this film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism and the threats of superbugs west nile virus and sars as a thriller the tension is fairly intense richard widmark and paul douglas are more than serviceable in their roles the domestic scenes between widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot the actor in this film who most left his mark is jack palance his sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface the chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today recommended 7 10
<START> this is a rip roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in 'streets of san francisco' i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes one thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk could someone please assist
<START> a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed mcmahon and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic
<START> it's not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you're not 100 sure of your mental stability because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film so the majority of the viewers wouldn't have the level of maturity to reach in to its delightful side kind of like tarkovsky films but different in a way i myself can't say i had a lot of fun watching it but it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clichÃ© that hollywood offers hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over you can't simply sit back and watch it you'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film a film that's similar to this in style is nachtgestalten but it was considerably better and way less violent this one for instance is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad tempered most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film i give it a 9 because i've seen the multiple stories in one film phenomenon in another film and it was better but this one's an outstanding piece on its own worth watching but get ready to see something disturbing
<START> since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series x files but with a bit more of a comedic light hearted approach but don't get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty greuesome plots left to the imagination of course this was the early 70s television br br some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or sci fi horror themes this series brought all that together each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so 1 hour with commercials and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more a great classic show that is underrated in my book
<START> three giant sabretooth tigers created in a laboratory from mitochondrial dna a genetic breakthrough derived from fossil material are on the rampage accidentally set free through a series of events such as a computer geek's introduced virus in order to unlock security measures keeping the resort novelty shops closed during construction a security guard's leaving a gate open while searching for the missing page from a porn mag that flew away in the breeze that threaten the lives of those it comes in contact with the tigers are always hungry but are unable to digest what they eat so pretty much the tigers just rip their prey to shreds victims include a group of college kids the stereotypes include a goth girl jock and tech nerd security personnel and those somewhat developed rich scoundrels who we can easily despise and wish horrible death br br rounding out a series of bad sci fi channel flicks attack of the sabretooth has some of the most wretched computer simulated animals i've seen yet and the final death sequence is so putridly presented you'll demand within the deepest recesses of your soul the time spent on this truly awful exercise in the creature feature canon there's some good dark humor deriving from heads being torn from necks but even here the prosthetic work is unconvincing prosthetic body parts and blood aplenty as victims are pounced upon crying for help and receiving none i'm starting to sound like a broken record repeating myself in every user comment i write for these sci fi channel flicks i think maybe it's time to move on to other kinds of cinema robert carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being wooed by his truly repellent ex brother in law nicholas bell the one opening primal park a resort zoo featuring genetically created sabretooth tigers as it's major attraction stacy haiduk still quite yummy is a security officer who attempts to convince bell to get the investors he hopes to goad into putting money in his multi million dollar project to leave the island brian wimmer is haiduck's lover and his role is a mechanic keeping operations running smoothly br br bell's fate at the end resulting from a dislodged tooth from a sabretooth tiger statue is the pits carradine spends a great deal of the film taunting bell his arch nemesis the tiger's point of view shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them the film ultimately consists of characters walking through darkened corridors the tech nerd's virus cut off the power worried for their safety the college kids commit breaking and entering to score certain items needed it's a scavenger hunt type of activity to enter a fraternity sorority the cast playing these kids do not rise above their clichÃ©s
<START> this is only related to the first movie by the name the plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad avoid this at all costs the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish
<START> and that is the only reason i posses this dvd now i haven't seen the first nemesis film but i did check the info out of it and i here by say what why because in the first film alex was male but then again the first one was set in the future so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time who knows at least it wasn't addressed in the film in any way br br here's a quick summary of the plot alex still a baby then or how ever you want as it was is in the future escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80's africa there mommy gets killed and alex sue price grows up in a african tribe then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg so there does sound familiar doesn't it br br terminator isn't the only film being ripped here predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie the vincent price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from br br lets see what else okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film it would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever biggest problem is the plot things just happen and the viewer is barely interested nemesis 2 isn't the crappiest piece of cinema i've had pleasure to watch but it does come damn close br br i won't say a thing about acting because let's be honest here did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here oh well at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior way br br a real movie rating 2 10 there isn't a lot of pros about the over all quality and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense br br a camp movie rating 4 10 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film so it does have small merits in it
<START> some 25 year olds behave like teenagers coping with the death of a high school mate trying to find their purpose in live and love the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie stay away from it 1 10
<START> first a little summary this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military government censoring him nice message government censorship and all that but the way they did the movie was well let me explain br br this movie is beyond description the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution the script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth grader as for special effects i understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire here's a tip buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going don't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game the acting well let's put it this way in my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this the godfather i won't even go into the inconsistencies find them yourself br br what disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said okay this looks good let's release it it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release this isn't dvd quality this isn't sci fi channel quality hell this isn't even film school quality if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an f no not even an f more like an f i wouldn't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled br br i felt used after i saw this thing blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and i'd prefer not to think of what they're doing with it i have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesn't feel good to think that i walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards i didn't much care for this this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen i have not seen anything by ed wood but i have confidence this is worse if you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache if not i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night however if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out you won't be disappointed
<START> i hope she can keep acting and directing she's surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art her work has a rare kind of generosity and her timing is spot on oy i'm kvell
