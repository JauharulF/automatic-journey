<START> even though this was a made for tv production there's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product this movie did have a budget and it had a casting department so if you're going to make a movie about a true life story and actually put the true story in the title shouldn't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism first of all this movie is absurdly cast these actors belong in daytime television soaps or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movies and not in a real life gangster criminal tale everything about them from their looks to their mannerisms just screams of the 90's shopping mall alt rock listening generation what about the script two words describes it stupid and insulting and again it's way too 90ish sounding i don't think the real clyde barrow ever uttered the words i'm outta here it's as if a bunch of new kids on the block fans got together and decided to make a really kewl flick about bonnie and clyde you know one that would be totally rad and rockin' well this sticker doesn't even rank on the rad and rockin' scale everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here from the casting and acting to the editing and music every single thing is grossly wrong and it's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title it's certainly not the true story but even worse it's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that's accepted on its own terms like i stated in my heading it's simply horrible beyond words on every level imaginable trust me on this or watch at your own risk
<START> another one of those films you hear about from friends or read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead end home town in tennessee to florida with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten up car br br the heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didn't she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder but she has her reasons as it turns out br br just a fine film the only thing i don't much like about it i think is the title
<START> a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained br br this movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itself br br this may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides pierre fresnay is sublime
<START> hatred of a minute is a hauntingly beautiful film a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer eric seaver strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies some shout outs to the film's producer bruce campbell as well as to the film the evil dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre
<START> i've gotta say i usually like horror movies that i've never seen however this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste i'm used to the gory gut wrenching types but this particular movie was lame the acting was horrible yet the corny no pun intended one liners were cute and the sequel to it scarecrow slayer was even worse yes probably when it first came out there was a huge rave about it and people liked it but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish if you want a movie to just pass the time pick this one the special effects are cheesy as heck but seeing that it was a low budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in this will kind of remind you of the movie children of the corn independent movies rock most of the time so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs or in the sequel 2 scarecrows going at it then these movies would be for you
<START> this film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits hah what good bits the only bit that was worth it was the ending those who have seen the film will know what i mean i expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets freddy vs jason but what i got was this crap story was forgettable the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this this could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched ok so what if there was a nice bit of t and a i was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie shouldn't be done
<START> really touching story of a recruitment camp in america where young men are prepared for the vietnam war the human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal subjective opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor br br the movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an anti hero from the view point of traditional standard the movie focuses on the tragic character of bozz who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war perfect irony br br the acting is truly exceptional and the documentary style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war games enthusiasts hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted
<START> this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it br br i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin elvira suicides at the end but instead of this in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young this happened and he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there etc br br soon in the movie erwin elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat and while telling her the story of elvira's life fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of i have suffered much in my life and am about to die br br in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something erwin elvira encounters a former lover that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he recognizes elvira br br there are some interesting shots and ideas i must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder's self indulgence
<START> when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward so what have we theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen denmark it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from bend it like beckham where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing kung fu and we have a love story and a competition of course too after i accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu i'm not an expert though the lead actress semra turan is not only denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good kung fu intense sidenotes the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge xian gao a chinese cinematic kung fu instructor actor hidden tiger crouching dragon played the lead role's master br br if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it you'll probably have a good and intense experience and i don't know if this works on small screen as well
<START> i'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice bizarre hubby and i didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie we kept looking at each other with our best what the expressions there is no way to adequately describe this movie killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see what kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children parents whatever you do if your child still believes in santa don't let him her see this movie preteens can watch it probably with what the expressions on their faces if you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their eggnog br br quite possibly the worst film ever made
<START> after watching about half of this i was ready to give up and turn it off but i endured to the end this is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails the acting is poor much worse than the acting in 80s t a movies br br there are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100 predictable perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal but for those that have seen many movies you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes the rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll br br don't waste your time watching this
<START> i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water lilies i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing br br the main characters are young french women 15 years old marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it br br water lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at cross purposes and in at least two instances joyless mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and film makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative br br in the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter brook says french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism part of the downfall of this film is film maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism br br where is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh life affirming way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balance br br organically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go br br there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is film maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience br br perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because floriane's request is a phony derivative and substitute question not the authentic heartfelt question the movie marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve br br here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves 1 since when do the french of all people take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot 2 what teen of any nationality would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth br br the three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise blachere anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele haenel floriane could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both pauline acquart marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim br br all in all water lilies was very disappointing will an honest film maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no not necessarily for the sake of this middle aged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema
<START> for your own good it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie this flick stinks now i like at least in theory low budget horror movies but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make it takes itself way too seriously and unfortunately that's not it's only problem br br it's the story of the murderous beane clan of the british ilses transposed to modern times an interesting premise but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it br br 1 why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson she's a below average looking woman who can't act and she has a minor role answer she's apparently a well known porn star as you no doubt read in other reviews so i guess this is a cameo appearance for her she's giving the film much needed name recognition it seems her top billing isn't any indication of her talent though it's an indication of how untalented the rest of the cast is br br 2 how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland it doesn't even remotely look like ireland and the house that the guests victims stay in is this great big north american wood frame edwardian thing they should have skipped the whole beane theme and developed a story that took place in n a also if you're going to make a movie that takes place in ireland it's probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent and that was a really really really bad irish accent now this wouldn't have been so bad if the director wasn't trying to make the next night of the living dead but it seems he was too bad he could have had some fun with it in fact some of the scenes weren't far from being unintentionally comedic as they were br br like the infamous gutting scene were the woman is chained to the table stripped naked and then sliced open and eviscerated that's funny you ask well in the deleted scene version the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines it's actually funny after awhile and what self respecting cannibal eats intestines anyway do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens heck no we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks oh well br br some of the other cast who were annoying the whiny creepy howard rosenstein i'm not sure but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud in fact he's as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for him br br i checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb and apparently it's important to know that she graduated high school with honors i can't decide if it's more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation the honor student is doing nude soft core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard rosenstein wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie if they have hopefully they'll get the message avoid this fate go to college i could go on and on but why if you like gore you'll find something redeeming in this flick but not much more
<START> given the nature and origin of the 11 filmakers it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards america probably the most 'anti' segment comes from ken loach who is definitely not towing the british new labour party line although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most americans and most spectators who saw them unfold live through cnn etc the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an american monopoly should anybody be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the west gives to thousands tutsi tamil bosnian chilean kurdish need we go on victims if this was a 'wake up' call for the states then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the israel palestine impasse is further from a solution while george bush jnr would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place i think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the founding fathers went and why america orignally built as a bastion of freedom justice and tolerance now sees its self interest paramount while the third world wonders where the next drink meal or bullet is coming from
<START> synopsis the future as seen from 1939 england as war loomed over europe the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes br br concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow there will always be descent and fear and learning to overcome it is our only hope br br pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet it is in the public domain this is a fascinating work on numerous levels since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939 it has obvious flaws this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical this film was cutting edge for its day the special effects are very good as is the story line the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare br br one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems which we now know is not always true the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us br br the underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film the set design and wardrobe of forbidden planet the failings of technology in 2001 a space odessy even the lush landscapes cityscapes of star wars owe some amount of inspiration to this film br br the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it even as we reach there are those that are trying to hold us back this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step br br many great british actors are in this film as young men cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character cabel his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science br br this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark
<START> i like many people saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97 it was a below average film at best defiantly not the masterpiece that all these titanic fanboys like to make it out as first off dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it people just like him because of his looks his acting skills essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy second the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy ship they're on sinks lots of crappy love scenes thereafter anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever nor is it original plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3 hours i could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot in conclusion titanic is the most overrated movie to date why it got so much attention and money is beyond me
<START> passionate dramatic riveting as flamenco itself the film is simply amazing it is set on the immortal bizet's music the original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists leading proponent of the modern flamenco style paco de lucia who plays a musician with the same name legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer antonio gades co wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated georges bizet prosper mÃ©rimÃ©e novella opera he plays a main character antonio the famous dancer choreographer who works on retelling the story of carmen in the flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers br br brilliant and graceful cristina hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role hoyos had been the first dancer in gades' company for twenty years 1968 1988 and she was the protagonist of three films that carlos saura made of gades' three great shows bodas de sangre 1978 carmen 1983 and el amor brujo 1985 gorgeous laura del sol is a young dancer named carmen in whom antony sees from the first sight another carmen who was immortalized by two frenchmen the writer prosper mÃ©rimÃ©e in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired george bizet's world famous opÃ©ra comique version from 1875 br br as in the opera and in the novella carmen in saura's film is desirable and deadly the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else she could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission there some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen and as different as they are they all have in common the only possible tragic end saura gades' film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly spanish i fell in love with it from the first time i saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then highly recommended
<START> first and foremost i would like to say that i'm a huge sarah silverman fan and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery are what counts br br if you liked jesus is magic then i don't see how you wouldn't like this it has that same flow and that same rhythm true it's only for the true fans but if you are you'll be pleased br br again only for the true fans there's no way around that if you're not used to her style then you wouldn't get why this is funny however it is and i hope you think so too
<START> definitely the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody tell me where should have i laughed there's not a single hint or shadow of an idea the three leading actors are pestilential especially the one i think it's aldo from sicily who can't make a sicilian accent not to say about the dream like insertion about dracula just another expedient drawn from the worst cabaret tradition to make this film last a little longer massironi and littizzetto do what they can but this so called movie was really too too hard to rescue i would have given it 0 10 but the lowest mark was 1 10 and so i had to overestimate it by one mark
<START> i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script it would make more sense than this i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film this sounds really mean but i'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess see what i did there neither the skills to act or to write anything ever br br watch this only if you're incredibly drunk high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists i will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom after that i will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my dvd player fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery br br acting 0 10 plot lol 10 breasts 9 10
