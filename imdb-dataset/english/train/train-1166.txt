<START> carry on matron was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like cleo up the kyber and screaming being from the mid to late 60s br br in itself matron is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot a bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature i think that's where the problem lies the gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot perhaps the worst criticism i can make is that i saw carry on matron this afternoon less that twelve hours ago and i have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line that's a serious problem for a comedy
<START> nu image ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly 2 million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for 2 million br br mr hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at 20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for 750 000 if not considerably less than that few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish br br it's painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget br br those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p t barnum
<START> hi br br i heard about lost from a co worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment he loved it well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored so i tuned it out after a few years i stumbled upon lost bored with the current sci fi fare wow was i surprised can you say gravity well damn i got sucked in the pace and scripting are very good some of the flash forward backs are so so with the lamer characters but over all good my favorite characters are ben locke jacob richard alpert sayid jarrah sawyer hurley daniel faraday jin wife walt charlie desmond and jack's dad jack and michael definitely are immature asshats very spoiled and immature kate 1 step above them juliet was way more classy than kate mr eko way under rated and on the level of charlie if not more too bad they both died the guy dressed in black talking to jacob way back is a genuine curiosity as a whole great very layered series looking for more br br regards
<START> the movie begins a with mentally challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane the movie examines the life of five womenÂadela leire maricarmen anita isabelÂwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes their shoes is the first superficial yet affixed with some glancing meaning clue we get at their fragile identities in a theatrically embroidered and embellished way a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet the premise is risky and slightly contrived but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good br br what may have been light hearted and superficial quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes seeing the love or lack thereof the pain the confusion the hope the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below what a scene but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair br br moving along a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi while another has completely lost her husband emotionally sexually intellectually but not physically a ghost a pending divorceÂ reproach regret remorse a new love can you love a mirage can you love the person in the mirror can you love someone you can't love or think you can't love can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness a lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution definitive decision or effective healing maybe a elusive thought a fleeting feeling but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film live live again rewind the reel unveil the real the important the big stones piedras of life the rest is just details
<START> this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven't had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good
<START> not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated br br through the feminist director maureen gorris of antonia emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one note absent minded intense chess genius br br the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful br br originally written 5 27 2001
<START> this is a fan made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman it's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman dead end sandy collora br br as far as this film goes i could easily pick it apart sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect but this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible i was particularly impressed by the very buff superman he was no wimpy little guy if only this were a preview for a real film they'd have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it great job
<START> despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg maybe the cave paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened when the prehistoric beast appears it's a well animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area alright so it's not jurassic park but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
<START> one of the funnest mario's i've ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i'd still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it's very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
<START> now this show looks like most of the other shows of it's type from the mid 90's but the only thing is about this one is that it's different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i can't understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date br br my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn't hurt to dream doesn't it br br anyway i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
<START> this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn't try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature br br i won't talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched br br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don't appreciate it one bit br br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this br br 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible
<START> now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled erik stifler's sex problem is like jim's it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile' was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex br br anyway enough about the naked mile i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes aplenty yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler steve talley raises the bar with an exuberant performance the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald's cameo is hilarious there are weak points though coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first i'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part br br while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a stifler prerequisite you really can't care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish br br saying that the film does entertain and coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny br br overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser' stifler
<START> i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime br br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti gun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesn't follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to and or affect what happens afterwards br br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti depressant drugs more the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital i don't want to tell any particulars you're dead wrong on that too i've been there the script was so real it was amazing br br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late someday they'll thank you for it
<START> this is a bad bad movie i'm an actual fencer trust me when i say that this film's pretension of accuracy is just that this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80's pop the ending is predictable and the movie is a bore from start to finish horrible
<START> terminus paradis was exceptional but niki ardelean comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country br br we are just born not reincarnated and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song priveghi maybe younger directors should make the move
<START> i found this family film to be pleasant and enjoyable even though i am not a child it is based on the concept of a high school girl susan elisha cuthbert discovering that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock she learns how to control the machine with some uncertainty about time of day br br the film is not a work of serious science fiction you have to ignore the usual instability paradox associated with altering the past through time travel i e the past is changed to prevent the 1881 walker family from becoming poor but the change means the family never got into financial trouble so victoria wouldn't have told susan about the financial problems her mother had which means that susan shouldn't have had a reason to change the past in the first place but other than that there are some nice touches in the story such as the old elevator panel found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and installed the time machine not having a space for the lock that activates the time machine feature as in many stories for children we need to also suppose that a child will not share startling information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult but instead hide the time traveler br br it also requires disregarding some poorly staged scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors the child actors elisha cuthbert gabrielle boni and matthew harbour all were very convincing in their parts in one scene in the 1300s native americans notice susan observing and photographing them but they don't register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blond white skinned girl in peculiar dress their response is to simply stop what they are doing and to walk calmly towards susan in the same scene an indian mother is carrying what is supposed to be a baby but is so obviously a doll its white skinned and its head flops around br br timothy busfield the award winning actor who originally came to fame in tv's old thirty something gives a somewhat uninteresting sometimes listless performance in the other extreme michel perron hams it up as the italian building superintendent janitor as does richard jutras in his role as a nosy neighbor the neighbor's name is edward ormondroyd which is the name of the author of the novel the film is based on i suspect that these problems may be the fault either of the director or possible of a low budget br br despite these flaws i recommend the movie for kids in addition to the interesting story it also has some educational value in that it points out how much both technology and social norms have changed in little more that 100 years
<START> i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible br br the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chabert's performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie br br dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was great br br as for the male lead armand assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series br br all of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible end solution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time
<START> finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares i see most horror films that come out theatrical straight to dvd cable etc and most of them suck a few are watchable even fewer are actually good dark remains is one of the good ones i caught a screening of this film at the south padre island film festival the audience loved it and my wife and i loved it having no name actors i assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldn't know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently brian avenet bradley must know that character and story are important he develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger br br watching horror films that cost anywhere from 80 million to 5000 to make i find dark remains to be one of the gems out there check this film out
<START> this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie clichÃ© is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for dooley's next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs
<START> the last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains indian wars before the white man set foot on the other side of the mississippi the plains used to have herds of american bison as large as some of our largest cities by the time of the period the last hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out the 20th century due to the efforts of conservationists saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was br br robert taylor and stewart granger are co starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were valiant here stewart granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations br br the partner he's chosen to throw in with is robert taylor forgetting taylor for the moment i doubt if there's ever been a meaner nastier soul than charlie gilsen who taylor portrays in devil's doorway he was an american indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by louis calhern in the last hunt he's the racist here he kills both buffalo and indians for pure pleasure he kills one indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of debra paget's sexual favors he's actually mad when paget doesn't see it that way br br no matter how often they refer to russ tamblyn as a halfbreed i was never really convinced he was any part indian it's the only weakness i found in the last hunt br br however lloyd nolan the grizzled old buffalo skinner taylor and granger bring along is just great nolan steals every scene he's in with the cast br br for those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of robert taylor never seen on screen and who don't like cheap heroics the last hunt is the ideal hunt
