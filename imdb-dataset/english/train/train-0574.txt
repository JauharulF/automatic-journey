<START> 1st watched 5 17 2002 3 out of 10 dir ewald andre dupont fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much heralded event the replication of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way too soap opera like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against barelyÂ in his recreation
<START> although it has been 2 years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain
<START> yeah that about sums it up this movie was horrifying two minutes in i wanted to gouge my eyes out this has been praised as an innovative lds comedy but it's not even good for members of that church i don't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality br br first of all you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie it seems as if the horribly drab glib trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent at least semi coherent thought then there's the acting which is dismal from everybody involved even the cameos fail to liven anything up br br and let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue appallingly hideous gags and a lot of mormon in jokes that anyone in their right mind lds or not should consider purely stupid this has to be one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> dominique is one of those films that the expression slow as molasses must have been invented for too many endless and repetitive sequences how many times do we see robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano it is almost redeemed at the end by a surprising twist which unfortunately is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths not a very enjoyable film
<START> sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand up comedienne in the 1970s but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese's underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll 1994 or dinner rush 2000 but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself br br without you i'm nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it's an adaptation of her smash hit off broadway show which made her a superstar Â and madonna's best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90 minute tour de force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you can't miss out this film it's a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work Â hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i'm nothing didn't exist
<START> comment like my comment is necessary we are talking about all time masterpiece for all seasons and all generations this is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch in this like in other disney's movies is some kind of magic all characters are in some way alive and real so it's easy to understand message even if you don't understand language like i didn't understood when i first watched movie because i was about six years old maybe my english is not so good but i learned what i know mostly from this kind of movies and this is one more great dimension of this kind of movies which in present time are rare but there is a one big shame in my country is now impossible to watch this or any other disney's movie we don't have copyrights so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies so we will watch this movie again once upon a dream or
<START> i'm a great admirer of lon chaney but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me the story jumps around oddly i've since learned that the film is missing a section and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness some of the intertitles are overly explanatory e g why you're not a child anymore cut back to picture for a long slow beat you're a woman yes we got it the first time but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear let's hear luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument please the plot which involves incestuous desires figuratively if not technically was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch to the writer's credit this issue was treated as a problem and a may december match is not portrayed as the right and good inevitability of some mary pickford films e g daddy long legs chaney gives a good performance as usual but i think he has been better directed in the past he overdid it a few times here imho i did enjoy the clown sequences and was very impressed at the stunts loretta young was charming though astonishingly young the film has its moments but so far it's my least favorite chaney picture
<START> i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence they're getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest the acting was also superb
<START> i have seen this movie many many times and i will never get tired of it it is a classic in every sense of the word the movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time for those of you who are not a fan of subtitles or of foreign film in general open your mind this is a great movie for the beginner because the story is so entertaining don't get me wrong it is 100 japanese and that is what makes it work but everyone will get something out of it even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called mr aoki one of the funniest characters i have ever seen br br i can't even think of this movie without smiling i love it and i think most people will too
<START> what i expected a rather lame overly stereotypical portrayal of a sports mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team br br what i got an even handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting to themselves and each other that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share br br sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works barrymore is classic barrymore that perfect blend of sweet strong and adorable we expect that from her and she delivered br br but fallon is the nice surprise in this film he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life like caring about kids and his girlfriend fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection he can be caring you just ran across the field for me and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox how did the grass feel kinda spongy at the same time fallon's portrayal made the movie hopefully this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon something beyond the over the top sophomoric humor typical of snl alums i e will ferrell br br in short a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot on humorous lines most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallon br br hey i saw this with my wife not a baseball fan and she loved it as much as i did it's neither a guy flick nor a chick flick it's a terrific make you laugh flick go see it
<START> stuck in a hotel in kuwait i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning first pachelbel's canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a tiger moth which my grandfather my father and i have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe's name hooked me completely i was entranced by this film crowe's performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew avro ansons too the story and as another contributor pointed out crowe's recitation of high flight i won't spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4 000 odd miles as an ex army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot i admit to crying heartily a couple of times buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it but watch it br br ps did i spy a bristol blenheim in yellow training colours on the ground looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin 303 brownings in a dorsal turret
<START> i really like this show i can readily see how it achieved cult status it's original and thought provoking for some reason though i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have it doesn't pack the kind of open door winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise each time i watch an episode i find myself prodding and pushing for it to answer some nameless formless question br br before continuing let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion and my opinion only different strokes for different folks br br i would have liked to have seen more scenes in american gothic that were shot at night there's too much daylight in this show and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense we're not afraid of the daylight after all we're concerned about what's in the shadows the devil isn't always in the details what we're not seeing is often the most frightening br br second and this is the one that's probably going to lead to tar and feathers gary cole is a tremendously talented actor a character actor i've followed his career from the brady bunch films on which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck he's almost too petroichan too likable to be embodiment of evil even by biblical standards lucas buck is a narcotic he's heroin he's freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain o you keep going back even though you know the end will be madness and death he should be like the ultimate loan shark he's a maker of book but also of unspeakable condemnation sure you've got the money and before long you're also going to have broken fingers a severed hand a decapitated head and eventually a damned soul turning to buck is an act of desperation and whenever he's around there should be some immediate ambient finality with interest compounded daily in the air br br it's all largess all strings attached and by the time you realize that you'll also know that it's too late br br which leads me to three they showed buck a little too often he's in most of the scenes in fact which may have caused him to lose his edge the sheriff would be like the next door mythology he's the apocryphal acquaintance many would know 'of' him but only an unfortunate few would really know him he'd be the stuff of flashbacks and cryptic conversations and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayed br br four the show could be very self reverential to a fault some might say and this is typified by the whistling of meet me at the fishing hole in the series pilot i think we've already established that what cassidy and raimi were shooting for was the anti andy taylor we probably didn't need the concept delivered to us via fed ex i gathered that within the first five minutes so for me the piano on the head was unnecessary br br these remarks are all about what for me would have made a good show great i also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup in their everlasting quest for lcd programming the network played a definite role in the demise of this series br br the least these jerk off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order br br get real br br either way it's a grievous loss to both genre fans and casual viewers alike
<START> ba ba ba boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospital's laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie the music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep
<START> a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent tom wood and arye gross are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager ron perlman whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city the costume killer so named because after injecting his victims with windex he dresses them in silly costumes they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers john considine joe pantoliano kristy swanson and discover that the art of movie making can be murder br br there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows rumor is the studio wanted a lighter dark comedy our loss and the actors who all do fine jobs and deserve better as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute br br if you're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions he wasn't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode he's just simply fun to watch in this one br br david dukes also shines in a two scener but pivotal role
<START> paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made dave it's the same story not as funny though br br paul related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national anthem of parador he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas three planes car ride to the set etc he was beat he could hardly stand had to use a cane he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom br br he didn't know he could do it then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras paid 7 bucks he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours he was magnificent then nearly collapsed br br paul is a great guy though very liberal a real talent
<START> giant crabs cursing in japanese what was in that drink a terrible movie but laughable i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around drink much beer before you see this movie
<START> i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10 it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoo's makeup br br this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmy's schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it's still one of her favourites br br i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer animating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf
<START> diary of sex addict is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness probably a movie marketing scam this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it bottom line diary would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim and no job in spite of being a restaurateur at the best this flick could have been good drama at the worst cheap softcore diary isn't either and nowhere in between this one's for the dumpster d
<START> the men can slaver over lollo if they like or her lollos she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe who is not only beautiful but can act don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple dashing story of love and war in which all is fair they are not needed all you need know is that at the beginning of the film lollobrigida reads philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running jumping and swordplay br br on the minus side the obviousness of the story and the heavy handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts and of course the non french speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh la la such as virtuous girl i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan seducer my dear what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle
<START> a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town leading to all kinds of complications cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town hopper does what he does best playing a psycho known as lyle from dallas the real hit man walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns and john's direction creates a terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertaining it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up
