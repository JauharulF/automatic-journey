<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made even for a biker movie it's rock bottom the minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town how original and the townspeople's attempts to fight them off why don't they call for outside help who knows the fight scenes are obviously fake adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there understandably this movie belongs in the trash heap
<START> the main reasons to see red eye are rachel mcadams who delivers a stellar performance and jayma mays who is wonderful as the assistant hotel manager on the other hand cillian murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish the rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes on which i will elaborate br br please do not read further if you don't want to know what happens br br here is a synopsis of the plot rachel mcadams's character lisa manages a hotel where the new hard nosed homeland security director plans to stay that night rachel is returning to miami from a funeral but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves in the meantime someone is stationed outside the house of her father joe played by brian cox ready to kill him if cillian murphy jackson calls all lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the director's suite to one where jackson's cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the director and his family br br so here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences br br 1 jackson finally convinces lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection lisa tries to fake that she is making the call but coincidentally a guy across the aisle from jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead jackson catches on and grabs the phone from lisa br br 2 at one point jackson head butts lisa and she of course gets knocked out but only for 30 minutes br br 3 jackson catches lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large lavatory and he bangs her around a bit miraculously the only one who hears anything is an 11 year old girl whose word of course is discounted br br 4 lisa stabs jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing steals his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat the flight attendants oblige lisa by opening the door to the jet way br br 5 ok all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely but here's where it gets really stupid lisa gets into the terminal at miami airport and there is no cell phone signal every major airport in america has great cell phone reception br br 6 she runs through the airport with jackson in hot pursuit and no security officers even delay them br br 7 jackson who lost lisa in the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat but he can still be somewhat understood however he doesn't bother to call his man outside of joe's house ps there is no train at miami airport but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the orlando airport br br 8 lisa steals a car and rides away of course this time when she goes to make a call the cell phone says low battery and soon shuts off when will they stop using this inane plot device br br 9 while the phone still said low battery lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the director had been moved of course they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite thereby negating the need for the whole lisa jackson plot what's the story here was the director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view nevertheless everyone gets out just before the missile hits br br 10 lisa drives to joe's house to save her father only to see the killer outside although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her jeep into the house no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by br br 11 jackson arrives at joe's house and knocks him out we don't see how maybe another head butt he then explains to lisa that he didn't kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first give me a break what is this saturday morning cartoons br br 12 for the rest of the movie about 20 minutes jackson chases lisa around the house and she resourcefully fights him off of course a real killer i e one maybe played by jason statham would have done away with lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first 30 seconds during the course of this chase jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill him br br 13 finally jackson prevails and he is about to kill lisa when you guessed it he is shot by joe br br so here's my suggestion tell wes craven to stick to horror or maybe he should get together with michael bay who directed the equally stupid the island and make red island
<START> boasting an all star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the mad mad mad mad world of horror pictures the sentinel 1977 is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress cristina raines in this one she plays a fashion model alison parker who moves into a brooklyn heights brownstone that is and i don't think i'm giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of hell and as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly indeed the scene in which alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers despite many critics' complaints regarding raines' acting ability i thought she was just fine more than ably holding her own in scenes with ava gardner burgess meredith arthur kennedy chris sarandon and eli wallach the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained i was left feeling more than satisfied as the book dvd delirium puts it any movie with beverly d'angelo and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can't be all bad on a side note yesterday i walked over to 10 montague terrace in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house yes it's still there and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest nun at the top floor window looks much the same as it did in this picture if this house really does sit atop the entrance to hell i take it that hell is the brooklyn queens expressway but we new yorkers have known that for some time
<START> if you want to know the real story of the wendigo i suggest you pick up a copy of algernon blackwell's original story this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book br br i loved the book when i read it as a kid in campfire chillers by e m freeman and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out i was so disappointed when i finally saw it another thing is that there were too many pc politically correct undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film when the book was written pc didn't even exist br br my suggestion is don't waste your time or money if you see it on the video store shelf leave it there
<START> in the many films i have seen warren oates i have come to a definite conclusion here is one talented individual i first saw mr oates back in the 1960's television series called stoney burke from then on i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles that happened in 1974 when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called 'bring me the head of alfredo garcia ' of course his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'the wild bunch' i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic that is until i saw him in this flop the movie is called chandler a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950's created by raymond chandler because the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye i was immediately interested however i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull dis interesting slow pace twisted confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self collectively and with some of hollywood's best supporting stars such as alex dreier mitch ryan gordon pinsent charles mcgraw richard loo and scatman crothers this movie had enough power to reach mach five however it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where as a result one of my favorite actor's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground
<START> joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man miles rushworth who is played by herbert marshall mr marshall is quite good as miles miss fontaine acted her part to perfection she was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis banton also in the film is joan's mother lillian fontaine as lady flora i highly recommend this film
<START> i wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought i'd give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story won't give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didn't turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely
<START> linking story another first time viewing for me and again this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies and it's easy to see why though i realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some i certainly fancied director peter duffell's choice death and the maiden which incidentally is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode a great deal more though the linking device itself is not all that great the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and frankly it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him br br now to the individual stories themselves br br method for murder the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but to make up for this it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times tom adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house 1932 also it ends with a satisfactory diabolique type twist and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead that's all we need out of it really br br waxworks for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent as well as impeccably dressed in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand and ackland's inexplicable inability or unwillingness to leave town somewhat recalls the house trapped aristocrats of bunuel's the exterminating angel 1962 br br sweets to the sweet this is perhaps the finest episode of all with his ambiguous role here christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks who appears as lee's daughter the film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain' trivia note chloe franks appears as a grown up in the featurette included on the disc and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it later on reading her filmography it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long running stage adaptation of agatha christie's the mousetrap in london's west end which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of 2002 needless to say we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate and delicious portrayal in sheer evil mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile br br the cloak a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre while inventing some new ones which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and at one point christopher lee himself jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings geoffrey bayldon made up to look like ernest thesiger also has a memorably quirky bit the 'silent cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience i suppose and while some of the humor comes off as heavy handed a' la the fearless vampire killers 1967 or theatre of blood 1973 it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high and highly unusual note br br video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory considering i had no other version to compare it with the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film as for the extras beginning with the audio commentary frankly this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production whereas with some other films you're left rather expecting there to be more and as such it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed the featurette a rated horror film is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center stage but this time backed up with valid if all too brief contributions from producer max j rosenberg and stars chloe franks ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon we also get film notes reviews bios and a poster stills gallery which again are wonderfully assembled with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty and a welcome one at that
<START> i've always been a big cybill shepperd fan ever since i saw her series a few years ago this film certainly shows her in her best light yet the film was so wonderfully cast and played every now and again she drops little amusing lines just to make this film one of the best i've ever seen everybody really out does themselves especially robert downey jr and cybill shepperd they really made the film come true also i loved the little bit where mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor this is film at its best
<START> this is a truly awful b movie it is witless and often embarrassing the plot the basic making into show business routine is almost nonexistent in fact the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942 including the mills brothers count basie duke ellington bob crosby and freddy slack each group gets about the standard three minutes the exception being the mills brothers who for some reason warranted two numbers ann miller doesn't get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda br br the most interesting moment in the film in my view occurred in the duke ellington segment the band appears to be playing in a train standing in awkward positions in the deep south at the time the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling johnny hodges is seen next to duke and harry carney may also be identified in the last moments of the film trumpeter violinist ray nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an uncle tom bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way willy best did in many films for modern viewers especially jazz fans this homage to segregation is sad indeed some movies go best unseen
<START> this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot br br rise to power is set in the late sixties carlito's way is set in the mid to late seventies for this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late forties br br rise to power has no sign of gail pennelope ann miller no sign of kleinfeld no sign of rolando that carlito supposedly ran with in his hey day none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie we're supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few years br br rise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film also the pre quel creates the rocco and earl characters what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlito's way it's also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power where are the taglialucci's in this film there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison it's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole br br it is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito brigante into the story the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlito's way br br if you feel determined to see this movie the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre quel think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwood's man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other
<START> this video is 100 retarded besides the brain cell killing acting and plot it's way too long don't waste your money at the video store i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it just absolutely awful
<START> this movie has some fatal flaws in it how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the dr 's office is just bad writing or bad editing br br very very very predictable movie br br i am not sure how this film got made except it is was filmed in canada and probably received a government grant br br i must say the person playing aaron cory monteith did a good job br br unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then i would say it will kill some time but otherwise it is a movie no actor would want on their resume
<START> a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker the fact is steven spielberg probably our greatest story teller has been doing this in various movie formats for years the color purple at the time was considered risky especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark in hindsight this film should have come as no surprise for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in e t critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare it is quite an entrance no special effects no swashbuckling just brilliant story telling based on a literary classic by alice walker one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about african americans in the deep south slavery is gone but in the south depicted here it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves br br spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations it is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens empire of the sun always schindler's list etc his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a he uses mostly untrained first time actors b he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen and c it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years it is almost epic like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult br br whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with mister the pg 13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected it happens gracefully goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister nettie played by akosua busia are separated maybe forever possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence br br the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people there really is something to live for but love triumphs over all spielberg bashers take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens br br rating 10 of 10
<START> this stylistically sophisticated visual game presents Âa story within a story' the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever who fights persistently with his new text Â which is at the same time the screenplay of the film we're watching in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the filmÂ bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space light colours and a couple of cats the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker's interventions which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment the constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise what is Âtruth' and what Âillusion' which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space
<START> i've seen the gator bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge br br this is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but i was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a t a film br br b movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b movie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot on the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists these men are evolutionary drop outs just like they were in the gator bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve br br the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much but it is by far the most painful to watch we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with br br spoilers you know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed the woman does not live happily ever after she doesn't write her book she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks but hey what more did you expect br br oh and did you read the tagline if you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned i was really looking forward to thoseÂ
<START> you spend most of this two hour film wondering what's the story regarding the lead character br br will smith as a low key ben thomas will keep you guessing the last 20 25 minutes is when you find out and it's a shocker but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed until then smith plays it mysterious almost stalking people you know he has a good reason for doing it but it's never really explained once again to keep us guessing until the end br br all of it including a on again off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins emily posa might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together br br this is a two hour film and not the typical action packed macho will smith film in fact the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn sad face of smith throughout this story it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots he looks like he's lost weight and is sick smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness br br like a good movie will often do this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits
<START> i had always been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movie i had to see it i was bitterly disappointed this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn't wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e the superhuman strength or determined will it's just one long bad dream i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway i wouldn't waste your time on this
