<START> all these reviewers are spot on i've seen many bad films over the years believe me and this beats the lot br br this is not just a so bad it's good exploiter waste of time but a genuine hilarious movie atrocity br br check out the white furry monster type thing br br wet yourself laughing at thom christopher's spell weaving acting br br gape in sheer a e clenching disbelief at the threadbare sets br br this is one of those european co productions no wonder we have so many wars i swear some of the people taking part in 'wizards of the lost kingdom' aren't actually aware they are appearing in a film br br fact i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful it is worse even than lee majors in the norseman more laughable than all of john derek's films this is truly the citizen kane of trash
<START> a surprising rent at a local video store i was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge oliver stone's natural born killers and almost as disturbing i think it went well with my viewing to be in late 2004 watching the republican machine do it's magic on the majority of america's television viewing populous it brings up the question are we really that manipulative br br it definitely skewed my view there was also a larger theological question being provoked the story of christ could word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitive as television produce a messiah could the story of christ been exaggerated could it have been completely fabricated it's something the movie puts in a extremely perceptive light
<START> but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive in fact imo he is ugly his acting skills lack everything sascha is played very well by joanna pacula but she needed more lines than she was given her character needed to be developed there are way too many men in this story there is zero romance too much action and way too dumb of an ending it is very violent i did however love the scenery this movie takes you all over the world and that is a bonus i also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it not too much or too little but enough that it got my attention the actors needed to be more handsome the biggest problem i had was that nevsky was just too normal not sexy enough i think for most guys sascha will be hot enough but for us ladies that are fans of action nevsky just doesn't cut it overall this movie was fine i didn't love it nor did i hate it just found it to be another normal action flick
<START> steven vasquez directed and co wrote with james townsend the star this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller so why doesn't it work for starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters not that that is a bad thing it can certainly enhance some films that have been hollywood successes the film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women relationships disturbed parenting the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events and murder it is all a bit much to cram into a 96 minute film br br devon james townsend by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend jenna sarah kelly but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets brian alex wilson who has been down the same path and can offer devon assistance on every level they bond devon comes out and the mysteries begin boys are missing in the neighborhood devon's stepfather psychologist dr kirk tyler dan swett is not at all what he appears to be and despite devon's consoling mother donna sonja fisher devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship it seems dr tyler is in a dark business with hunky detective cunningham earl mcdougle who apparently is investigating the missing boys devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of dr tyler and his detective sidekick and through it all donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy etc br br some of the actors are pleasing to the eye and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently but the degree of acting is at an all time low the only thing that makes us forgive that and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved yes this is a low budget movie and yes the director needs time to learn his trade but in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level maybe their next one will be more polished grady harp
<START> i debated as to whether or not i should tick the spoiler box since 99 of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of scrubs it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler br br clip shows grrr we all knew friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows and five and a half years into scrubs they've gone and fallen down that hole br br i have to wonder if the writers just couldn't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves let's show the other funny stuff it didn't work br br for starters showing all the times that people have fallen down isn't funny when taken out of context it's not funny to see todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know why he was dangling by his banana hammock br br second for what was supposed to be a compilation of jd's fantasies one was turk's dream another also wasn't his fantasy although i forget which br br and that's the problem this episode is totally forgettable we've seen all these things before and the collection of clips of people dancing why that's not funny br br finally i must admit two of my favourite scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation dr cox realising that ben died and jd telling him how proud of him he is br br but even seeing those moments again didn't save the episode the summary says it all br br worst episode ever bill lawrence please don't let your show go the same way as friends keep it fresh keep it funny or wrap it up
<START> seven pounds emotionally flat illogical morally disturbing br br the movie was distributed in italy as seven souls i was curious about the original title and after some research i found out that it refers to shakespeare's merchant of venice where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to repay his debt whereas the italian translation makes ben's plan something deeply human characterized by human sympathy the original one though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep rooted in the physical side of man unfortunately i think that the real quality of ben's plan is revealed by the original title it'a a cold machination aimed at donating parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie the only exception is the love story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non programmed incident to which ben yields but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement i really didn't like the idea at the core of the movie the idea that a person however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide besides being improbable it makes no sense i would have liked and i think it would have been more positive if in the end ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence he wouldn't have saved their lives miraculously of course this would have probably caused more suffering but i think it could have been more constructive from a human and moral point of view there are many illogical and disturbing things the initial reference to god's creation in seven days which by the way according to the bible are six what does it mean and what about a woman suffering from heart disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body doesn't seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his impaired condition the movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one
<START> an unmarried twenty something hick played by john travolta leaves the farm and goes to houston where he learns about life and love in a texas honky tonk at face value it's a modern love story texas style there's gobs of cowboy hats pickup trucks neon beer signs and references to big belt buckles and rodeos the music if not texas native is texas adapted courtesy of the talents of mickey gilley johnny lee and the charlie daniels band and that texas twang y'all br br the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five alarm chili made with jalapeno peppers it's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman maybe hamlet it's not but urban cowboy is spicy and explicit and i kinda like it br br technically the film is generally good the dialogue the production design and the costumes are all realistic the editing is skillful and both the casting and the acting are commendable if not oscar worthy i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays but he does a fine job ditto debra winger barry corbin and brooke alderson among others are good too in support roles but the cinematography seemed weak the film copy i watched was grainy and at times suffered from a reddish orange tint a visual trait i have noticed in other films from the same time period br br at first glance the film does not seem to offer any social or political message but i would argue that when urban cowboy was released twenty five years ago it had rather prophetic implications in 1980 the u s had all kinds of problems not the least being american hostages held by iran in the minds of a lot of folks back then the u s was being pushed around bullied br br this film along with others of its time offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders toughness urban cowboy is a very physical film the characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth but they're tough br br everything about urban cowboy is anti intellectual as a vehicle for cultural expression then this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new get tough era for the u s it started in 1980 with the election of reagan and that era continues to this day with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression traits that americans seem to gravitate to as surely as texans to five alarm chili
<START> despite the excellent cast this is an unremarkable film especially from the aviation perspective it may be somewhat better than the egregious von richthofen and brown but not by much blue max remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while darling lilli is fun if not taken seriously it's interesting to speculate what ilm could do with zeppelins and gothas in a new high quality ww i aero film
<START> great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt's character interviewing the president or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us scenes like those would have kept the audience awake cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching also big fans of fising early 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well
<START> this film could well have been one of those ordinary soapies relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwinedÂ broken relationships building new friendships street bashings near accidents hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes what a mixture of events br br fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers he asksÂin this chaotic world do things just happen is it just luck when things turn out right or taking a fatalistic view is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective most of us have had this uncanny experience br br is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important as one character saysÂ he once sat on the edge overlooking the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was br br this is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role
<START> there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode from the very beginning an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours kirk spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown except for an elderly librarian br br the librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate frozen waste br br the intercutting between the two stories and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled with return to the present an unknown chance while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion br br imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series which concluded one episode later this has to be one of the best of the whole series especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall
<START> this film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother wife by moving to genova italy br br the plot of genova sounds promising but unfortunately it is empty and without focus the film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family such as swimming taking piano lessons or cooking eggs most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome completely failing to engage viewers emotionally the ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular moving or emotional i can safely say that i am disappointed and bored by genova the only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of genova genova can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city but not as a film to be enjoyed
<START> just saying you've got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen but writer director james cox delivers oh so much more a rashamon of the sleazy hollywood set the film splitters the july 1981 wonderland murders through a variety of angles and film stocks but mostly through the filter of john holmes' coked out weasel brain in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile the most pathetic or both several versions of the story emerge and merge as cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting the dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown not even at the climax though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working strutting cringing bragging or begging kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted levine as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa kudrow as holmes estranged wife the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy josh lucas the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland there is always a worse version possible but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth
<START> the legend of andrei konchalovsky's towering 4 and a half hour poem to siberia is not to begin at once because it must hold back for space because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half remembered childhood memories in a turn of the century backwoods village yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the soviet working spirit konchalovsky celebrates soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like soy cuba and invincible the mood turns somber and reflective news of the revolution reach the secluded siberian village through the grapevine the fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist through all this konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancÃ© who never came back waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancÃ©'s father with an axe the irreverent folly of the fiancÃ© who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland the despair and resignation of the middle aged regional party leader who comes back to his small siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant the movie segues from decade to decade from the 10's to the 80's with amazing newsreel footage trailing soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire terrific visuals here all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces but the actual movie focuses on the individual on triumphs and follies small and big by the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning it can't matter seems like the world is saying to which konchalovksy answers it must matter because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption br br yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape' something seems to hover shadowy almost substanceless like the eternal old man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists sometimes a mere spectactor sometimes the enigmatic sage a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters something invisible seems to lurk ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky a curious bear indeed the eternal old man himself konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order in its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism it reminds me of shohei imamura's the profound desires of the gods when in a dream scene alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of stalin to reach out at his dead father as he vanishes in the fog the movie hints at the betrayal of the soviet dream or better yet at all the things lost in the revolution this betrayal made more explicit in the film's fiery denouement the amazing visuals elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge help seal the deal by the end of it an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema
<START> i give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2 it does not make sense to you well it doesn't have to this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot no let me rephrase incredibly idiotic plot where space cowboys complete with cowboy hats battle a space race of moron vampires br br does it get any uglier than this the only good thing in this movie was natassia malthe with her stunning norwegian beauty god i wish michael ironside and the deluise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies i mean at least seaquest was nice i know mr ironside from a lot of movies he has acted in 164 movies at this date it's true that he was rarely in a major role but still
<START> basic slasher movie premise 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family yawn br br watching 36 minutes of a premonition of oj's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco yawn br br old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter yawn br br 23 minutes of watching the actors eat yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ok there might be a drinking game here nope yawn br br complimentary shower scenes ok got my interest for a couple of seconds br br completely random and uninspired killings yawn br br the ending dude that psycho is deranged why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes unfortunately that is it my advice fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player for me i am going back to sleep
<START> i haven't been able to decide if this movie is so bad it's good or to quote enid coleslaw so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again no matter it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might and it offers up a number of scenes that you won't forget even if you want to there's a sneering young ray liotta telling a pigtailed pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis a bit later there's ray again molesting pia not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose there's a firm chinned pia telling her domineering mom that she wants to go to bed with ray's geezer father walter there's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by pia or anyone else wwwwhhhyyyyyyy there's that garden hose again as walter waves it pia's face and roars is this more to your liking there's pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes off there's pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress perhaps best of all there's pia's typewriter but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most afterwards i was afraid to open my laptop and finally there's pia at the awards exposing hollywood for the cesspool it is spitting out the second best line ever i guess i'm not the only one who has ever had to her way to the top i see i have already spent more time commenting on the lonely lady than i have on far better pictures so i'll quit be forewarned though that once you start watching you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever
<START> there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better this truly was a horror film i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that i will never get back the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them
<START> let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george narrator huh wait a minute who the heck are you george me new george studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser narrator how did you get the part george new george just lucky i guess br br sadly that's the only funny part in the entire movie br br it was still entertaining but then again i'm easily entertained br br i wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen that title goes to the terribly un funny disaster movie this movie falls 7 on my bottom 15 list br br if your a small child who is easily entertained you'll enjoy this movie if you're a movie watcher who wants a good funny movie you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one
<START> this is really a great unknown movie perfect dialogue without the typical clichÃ©s this movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off it even had a little bit a comedy in it but it wasn't overdone once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all br br now onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal it's a shame that he's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne's junky half brother eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey drug lord i loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan who were paired perfectly as two of calderon's henchmen br br once in the life is for sure a keeper 1 2 out of
