<START> when i began watching the muppets take manhattan the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced i was watching something recent so you can imagine my surprise when i came to the imdb and read that it was made in 1984 jim henson may have ended the muppet show when it was at its peak but spin offs like this and muppet babies which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film are the absolute nadir of all things muppet i used to wonder why muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as mr cranky so i am glad that the muppets take manhattan henceforth tmtm set me straight on that one of course many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around aliens robocop the evil dead even night of the living dead so while it is no surprise that tmtm is less than the muppet movie or the great muppet caper the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow up tmtm is not only is the music far less satisfying the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible br br there are of course some redeeming and genuinely funny moments but they are few and far between the swedish chef is great in any scene he inhabits so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest the problem is that there are just no scenes that work the story such as it is revolves around a broadway musical kermit is attempting to get produced he goes through many trials and tribulations along the way including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before the biggest problem is that kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time charles durning was cinematic gold as doc hopper the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit kermit for his business charles grodin was dynamite as nicky holiday a jewel thief the muppets must fight in order to save miss piggy from a lifetime in prison the saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films br br charles grodin also highlights what is wrong with tmtm namely the music sucks the opening number of the manhattan melodies show that is at the centre of tmtm to put it nicely makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated i might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me but songs like the rainbow connection inspired tears of joy not irritation grodin's big solo during the great muppet caper while not having the same resonation he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own he is all class and if there is one thing tmtm could use it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class tmtm also feels severely time compressed with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown together pieces see if you can find them in tmtm br br while tmtm does have its guest stars they are either poorly utilised brooke shields and john landis or totally out of their element liza minelli dabney coleman to call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery the absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here after animal's go home postscript for the muppet movie in particular which highlights another problem the characters are poorly written at best with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard animal shouts singular words at times but they have nothing to do with the plot or the conversation going on around him say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters but think of animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills or his sowwy after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow muppets now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual muppet other than swedish chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three dimensional film involving popcorn give up then you have proved my point br br given that labyrinth one of the henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the muppets arrived some two years later it makes tmtm all the more puzzling perhaps this misfire convinced jim henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to frank oz who at the time had just finished working with george lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original star wars saga the writers were also involved with the great muppet caper so i will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film the production is also substantially improved here with muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them had the story and script been better thought out tmtm might have been at least comparable to the great muppet caper as it stands now it is a great answer to the question of whether muppets write under the influence or excrete br br for that reason i gave the muppets take manhattan a three out of ten two to denote its actual quality and a bonus for the swedish chef's moments without him this film would be unwatchable
<START> although kurt russell was and is probably the closest person to look like elvis in show business so many things were false in this film first of all the makers claimed elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump suit made in 1972 also they claimed he sang 'burning love' which he first sung in 1972 and 'the wonder of you' which he first recorded in 1970 they also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all elvis fans know he got it for his birthday i know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like elvis
<START> i really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise however my history speaks i must not tell a lie bobby deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels i never thought that i would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did al pacino isn't acting in this film he's posing there are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera he's perfectly awful marthe keller is just as bad these two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever sydney pollack directed this film there's no trace of the genius behind tootsie here is this the same man i cheered for in eyes wide shut i can hardly believe it save yourself a horrible movie experience run don't walk away from bobby deerfield
<START> this rip off of the 1984 hit gremlins is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made even for a 'b' grade movie all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot acting and goodness br br it begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance why because a few minutes into the film he walks into the 'forbidden' safe and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub br br this is just an appetizer for the scat filled main course the main character kevin struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy perhaps he succeeds within the film but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard and is guided through his security shift in the wait for it abandoned studio lot yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself back to the film kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the hobgoblins the hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason they must be returned before sunrise or else or else what exactly br br other characters include kevin's 'macho' army friend nick nick's 'woman' daphne whose character has no more substance than a bitch slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits there is kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend amy whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed cher look alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top don't ask me how that works quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is kyle how such groups of friends are made is up for question kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self stimulating his hobbies include calling up sex chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear br br the story unfolds as the heroes search for the hobgoblins knee high creatures aka hand puppets which for some reason attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars or the film having a big budget br br warning spoilers ahead the twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering what the hobgoblins are returned to the safe by their own free will perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc or perhaps the story writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending upon returning to the safe the old security guard reveals what he learned in the military and detonates explosives which destroys the safe signaling the end of the evil hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride better fitted to a ride on an escalator br br the sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears if you plan to watch it i recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind
<START> out of the first five episodes of hammer's short running hammer house of horror series this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that bled to death is arguably the creepiest one as a great fan of the hammer studios' gothic horror films for many years i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far i've only seen the first five episodes and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are i will be satisfied whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations years later william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies move in the house with their little daughter sophie emma ridley soon after moving in however the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house which is seemingly haunted the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry growing pains episode 4 and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances the film is also well made in terms of effects cinematography and score the house that bled to death is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer fans should like to see in a short horror tale the film delivers a creepy atmosphere genuine scare moments and intelligent twists and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end overall this is highly recommendable to hammer fans
<START> i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun scarecreow is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims actually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks i'm not trailer trash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody wah ok i'm exaggerating but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies br br adding to what i just said the kid's mom is promiscuous he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on mom's boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like omg i didn't mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims haven't been stalked like this before scarecrow's official tag line br br to make matters worse this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days that's right 8 days i was going to give this movie a 2 because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments they're spoilers so i won't spoil it for you if you actually want to see this crap i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level br br this movie isn't nearly as good as i'm making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times
<START> i liked this film a lot it's dark it's not a bullet dodging car chasing numb your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds br br in the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to repent he does what he feels is right 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done ' it's not a question mortal men can answer so he does what he feels he has to do what he's good at what he's been trained to do br br denzel washington is a great actor i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done and he's got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone
<START> i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess br br it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows br br a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism fatalism menace and cynical characters br br well that is the story here 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness alcoholism laziness indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other br br would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress br br whilst some good moments i finished up feeling i had wasted my time br br 4 10
<START> universal's answer to the exorcist isn't a very good one unfortunately the film offers bland unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater sized plot holes not to mention it's unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story br br model cristina raines moves into a high rise owned by the catholic church with a creepy blind priest john carradine who holes up in there always at the window she begins to suffer faint spells and nausea what's worse is tenants she meets in the building such as burgess meredith with a cat and a canary and a young beverly d'angelo as a lesbian ava gardner looking great at 55 is the realtor who showed raines the place cristina's lover is chris sarandon whose wife committed suicide after finding out they were having an affair josÃ© ferrer has a small role as the priest of the brotherhood who informs monsignor arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high rise not only housing carradine but raines as well sarandon sends a hired hand up to the high rise one night to check out a certain room above cristina's apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket he winds up dead the very same night cristina kills her dead father in a nightmare screaming mad on the street cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli wallach and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hot shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife's suicide that case is really a motivating factor is wallach's dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on cristina and if sarandon has anything to do with it you also have martin balsam as a professor who understands this type of latin cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room now renovated that cristina once stayed in what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation towards the end of the film wallach and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating their characters are just left on the back burner how the priests know that now is the time when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high rise and why cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn't adequately explained how certain ghosts just appear to cristina and disappear when she tries to show gardner the rooms they occupied during a cat's birthday see for yourself isn't adequately explained not to mention gardner's role in the grand scheme of things she brings people to that high rise but what is really her reasons in the film it seems like this film should've been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary
<START> when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a 34 yr old tabu wait in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of cheeni it is the content that is kum in this adman turned writer director r balki's maiden effort br br trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise cracks and bitter sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating by the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished there is not much left to be said therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a satyagrah is really a test of patience there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in the result second half is dry flat with no energy there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances
<START> i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is untouchable the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the hottest act in town and he has his eyes on the apollonia an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap this is a classic 4ever
<START> weak bobby pineapple salsa flay and mario batali bring this down br br flay being the worst definitely a one trick pony i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs the kind of dishes this duo come up with really don't reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series i don't think batali even went to chef school actually there are a lot of great chefs in america i just wonder why they don't appear on the food network br br it would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co hosts who can handle the pressure i like alton brown but he is a bit too flippant funny for this role
<START> this was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting willy nelson was as stiff as his braids the movie just seemed like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that jessica simpson wore especially as there were so many close ups on her face the premise was not amusing and as i said soooooooo predictable whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste any allusions to other old marilyn monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of blonde ambition at all it was also so unbelievable jessica simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat that was laughable
<START> red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort
<START> i've never been a huge fan of mormon films being a mormon i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non mormon friends br br boy was i wrong br br i figured since this had b list talent like clint howard gary coleman andrew wilson and fred willard one of my favorites this would have to be at least a little funny and besides church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such but i must say throughout the entire movie it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored the dialogue was bland and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen every single character but wilson's was less than one dimensional it's hard to believe that after nine re writes the film was still as mind numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this my friends and i were extras in the final game scene so we went to the premiere in washington city ut kurt hale the director was there and i must say i avoided all contact with him after the show he waited at the door seemingly ready for feedback i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life but it left a nasty painful scar that i will never forget br br here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame uninteresting characters there were many subplots that popped up every now and then each promising the audience the chance for laughs but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ending before you could even start caring this was pretty much how the whole movie felt br br this film was a major letdown and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie true the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons then again it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears br br please do not see this movie keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious spare yourself the disappointment i went through

<START> title robot jox 1990 br br director stuart gordon br br cast gary graham anne marie johnson paul koslo br br review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re animator from beyond dagon and castle freak took a small detour here and did a little sci fi flick i stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick and there in lies its main weakness br br the story takes place in the future a world in which the great superpowers that according to this movie are the united states and russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues br br well the idea is awesome i guess the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director br br i as a kid loved this movie and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco and i'm like well this movie is a sci fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture i could go through it cause i loved this film as a kid and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it but everyone else was just not going to get it br br and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good first off the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief but unfortunately this being a small scale movie from a small scale company empire pictures which went bankrupt after making this film the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed br br ok granted once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool and made me go thats why i liked thid movie but every know and them some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in and boom your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise br br and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie this movie is basically a movie for kids you know giant robots duking it out stop motion animation hello but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities which really isn't a good mix br br so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie like i do well id suggest you steer clear away from this one gordons a great director but this movie he made just didn't do it for me well at least not now that i'm a full grown adult br br rating 2 out of 5
<START> while i can't deny that his movies are often entertaining i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream look at me aren't i an imaginative director his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative raging bull br br for this remake it appears it was business as usual though the dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself the melodramatic close ups combined with the sub par imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror the score for psycho was brilliantly unnerving this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature' the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden family br br the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away now i'm no expert on american accents me originally coming from near manchester in england an' all but surely he could've come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite it was disconcerting for me as a de niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performance br br possible spoilers br br the over the top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer not dead yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ br br all in all a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller' scorsese and de niro have done much better work together
