<START> how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long haired ghost woman shtick admittedly they've managed to rip off ringu a million times and often it worked well which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a requirement in the horror genre or that i'm very uncritical and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored it's not a bad film but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be with its absurd 110 minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films omc lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all as for the ring tone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i can't even remember it that's how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the bijita q or audition kind they're wasting their time
<START> ok i own this dvd i got it new at amazon i mean i think its badass and a pretty cool flick and melissa bale the slutty bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its ok i wouldn't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and ur obbsessed with this stupid movies like i am watch it sometime and i do not know how artisan dvd has s i c k in its dvd collection s i c k is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company ok well thats all
<START> the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn't even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs
<START> this is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'funky monkey ' finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon after seeing such classics as 'every which way but loose' and 'project x ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome br br these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought br br maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look a like matthew modine while some might argue that matthew modine doesn't come close to jet li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star br br did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie even matthew modine should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line 'i'm second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with the ladies br br shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them 'seven days '
<START> i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
<START> this is a weak sequel it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent man called horse in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre br br the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned having lost their homelands modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be a simpler time this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film br br the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film br br a huge disappointment
<START> the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichÃ©d stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining br br the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together br br once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won't like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other side' a good serious episode and 'window of opportunity' a classic comic relief episode
<START> four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she's never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequence also with baio where foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from
<START> there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the characters intense and surprising characters don't make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence br br where's the relationship between christophe and marcel where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does dolly rose appear at all since her story's never explained where's the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest attribute and downfall is that she can pass for white and her marriage to richard why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband why no backstory explaining this hatred br br as for the performances there's not a one that's better than mediocre though that's likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard but richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with br br all in all this is just terrible i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book turned film to be worse than exit to eden but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen
<START> bravo to czechs their once powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post communist slumber br br the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful prague cityscape to mention but a few br br the story is actually comprised of several sub stories that frequently intertwain and overlap an is in essence a collage of destinies fates desires it follows a group of urban youth to mid thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions and it is hillarious there's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a 100 people in a small art gallery laughed non stop for about 40 50 seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions br br although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all too familiar hardships i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations br br conclusion don't miss this one it's got a lot to offer
<START> hollow point though clumsy in places manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie br br the primary entertainment value here is humor everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy br br oh by the way advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie
<START> jim belushi is having a mid life crisis nothing is going right when his car goes out on him he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently a good premise with some moments but mostly flat and uninteresting on a scale of one to ten 3
<START> i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
<START> i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i knew br br from whose line is it anyway the wacky british improvisational br br comedy show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching and br br romantic without being sappy or sentimental the characters are br br all real people with real foibles fears and needs see it
<START> eric rohmer's 'the lady and the duke' is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but it's a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted but spoilt aristocratic classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director
<START> i don't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i have spoken of taste in another review saying it's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad taste br br i love films i loved isle of the dead which is pretty much an unknown b w film i even liked scream and scary movie i liked these films because they have if not a lot at least something good about them i appreciate 99 9 of the films i've seen because they tell a story which i haven't heard before and most directors only make films with a good storyline throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke and suchlike with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove i hadn't wasted my time i was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was here's a rundown storyline Â much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didn't make me feel a thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think oooo wasn't that clever because it wasn't in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tyler's true identity was cryptically shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was a work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist i think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist its like the ci2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by sebastian's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl acting Â the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad a sunset beach extremely corny and badly performed it's not even so bad it's good like hunk the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was a rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor i haven't seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film also br br i can't even say it is a good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film i'd be ashamed but they wouldn't anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film which this film has none of really i'm disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film and so dislike it i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly don't like any teenish story lines no i liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills 90210 all the time there's no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay i'm afraid besides i was 16 17 when i first watched it if anything being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film i can't believe anyone can give it 10 10 either one of my favourite films is memento and i gave it 9 as i know there can be better it is a shame for this site that people do that give 10s flippantly or don't get the films show and so give it 2 br br anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than loch ness br br if you aren't a teenager with bad taste or simply don't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film
<START> i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillip's character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me br br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shooting br br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
<START> i loved this film when i was little today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated films beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film although many people might not enjoy some of the songs most of them are well done and go along with the story it focuses on charlie a roguish handsome german shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first but eventually will win you over br br not a kiddie film by any means often very dark and frightening at times a treat for don bluth fans and animation buffs but do keep a tissue in handy adgth never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive arguably one of the greatest non disney animated films of all time along with watership down and my neighbor totoro br br bottom line a heavenly masterpiece
<START> my room mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it it is gross it is cheezy it is pretty dumb but it is also a lot of fun i mean this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since city of the walking dead ages ago it was like being at the old drive in theater again you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one and it's neat because it is suppose to be like that the cheeze factor is high the gore flows and the laughs roll the effects go from sloppy to good with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good there is not much plot just lots and lots of gore this one is patterned after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think because they linger on the gross scenes forever like this movie if you like troma movies cheezy b grade stuff then you can do no wrong watching this one a nice way to waste a friday night
<START> before i explain the alias comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen laroux as semi bad girl juanita when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short saved by the belle br br in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 minute movie is moe hitting curly wayne's character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy br br playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne robs the box office no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl br br things get complicated at this point because the villain al ferguson and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's the rifleman see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager moe and curly get blamed br br so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie br br larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's our gang shorts kornman is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them br br even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is staggeringly bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing br br one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
