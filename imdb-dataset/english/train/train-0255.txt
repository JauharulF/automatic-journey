<START> this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched robert carlyle is a wonderful actor but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong to cast liev schrieber as hitler's longtime friend and aid haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre a j w playing a nazi supporter bad bad bad casting this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background this was hollywood rubbish at its finest cashing in on the strength of a strong but sorely under utilized supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years br br the fake german accents vee vill vin zis var is insulting to german people everywhere my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from american english german all in the same sentence the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malone as the fated geli raubal was splendid though she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitler's shadow br br if you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitler's early years leading up to and including the war holocaust rent inside the third reich 1983 starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler it was good and made more sense then this baloney br br as a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies
<START> henri verneuil's film may be not so famous as parallax view 3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed after several years of investigation special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman but one man prosecutor volney played by yves montand thinks there's something more to be investigated and so the film starts this movie doesn't deal with some exact theories but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today's world such film could be made only in the 1970 ies but it will never lose it's actuality furthermore it's even a bit frightful how precise are it's oracles 10 out of 10
<START> i'd love to give kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary suspenseful to silly abc's fault they moved the show to friday nights at 8 00 p m then known as the family hour never should have been on fridays in the first place i was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes it was first up against police woman on nbc abc had huge problems with friday nights bad season for them overall until barney miller baretta and swat debuted in january of '75 kolchak should have been a hit darren mcgavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show too bad the writing wasn't up to richard matheson's in the original tv movies still mcgavin made kolchak his own as actors can do jackie gleason as ralph kramden and caroll o'connor as archie bunker come to mind that ins set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today yet that was part of the appeal they were very lucky to have simon oakland reprise vincenzo from the tv films
<START> i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin torgoff is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him this mini series that in shown on vh1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all can't find my way home makes it that much better to watch him on tv i know that he loves what he does and he does it well his eloquence is shown in the interviews which he did himself and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary from the music to the videos and everything in between this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it or didn't and would love to hear from fans three cheers for uncle martin
<START> this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavy handed the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and off key pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in off balance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner br br the film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930's a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan the film's over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay grim's son ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad parker posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film br br the film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the off kilter camera angles more irritating than humorous br br the over the top acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies counter conspiracies and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers the movie is much too long at 158 minutes br br that said fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal harley or devotees of parker posey who has the most camera time
<START> from the first moment this thing is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work while the overall plot has every potential for a thriller the story is so badly told that i'm unable to buy it from the middle of the film the actions of characters don't make sense to me stop reading now to avoid spoilers br br for instance ed's idea to have edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience it's just an extremely stupid idea domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from claremont williams over a breaking up phone connection just eludes me shouldn't she be long suspicious that williams is turning them in those fbi agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot out besides what they do by withholding and leaking information towards cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the fbi does investigations in reality they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this we get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises quite the contrary the accident is immediately followed by domino making love to choco which is from domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs br br the whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of claremont williams appears to me just as want to be dramatic razzle dazzle this combined with the awful uneasy camera work just makes a piece i hesitate to call a movie i'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is out of question
<START> this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby's mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably remo williams
<START> my short comment for this flick is go pick it up chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller there is no way the character of miklos claiming and pushing for room in every way possible wont push your nerves to the edge 2 thumbs up
<START> this entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff death wish copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well endowed brunette hottie supreme karin mani as billie clark a top notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup a on assorted no count scuzzy muggers rapists drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low life criminals attack her beloved grand parents the stunningly voluptuous ms mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous but much appreciated nude scenes unfortunately mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing on marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears my favorite moment concerning mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips don't mess with girls in the park that's not nice after clobbering a few detestable hooligans the delectable karin's sole subsequent film role was in avenging angel in which she does a truly eye popping full frontal nude scene but doesn't have any lines the film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene of course mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown strangely enough the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by edward victor's punchy direction a funky rockin' score endearingly crummy acting by a game if lame cast a constant snappy pace numerous pull out all the stops exciting fight scenes and howard anderson iii's gritty photography this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low grade low budget grindhouse cinema junk
<START> the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel if you want to see the movie then don't read the novel first as it will shock you however cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it acting performances are adequate however many important events that were present in the novel are omitted in the novel sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king
<START> this film was great br br the plot was preposterous br br the action sequences contrived br br but provided you can lighten up enough to laugh it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger br br the baddies were more silly than bad the good guys weren't too good the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes br br the inclusion of a baby added a good touch sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise br br i have to disagree about the acting it was on the whole very good i really wanted to punch judge reinhold br br and after all isn't that the mark of a really good movie wanting to punch judge reinhold
<START> if it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage it must be garbage this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life tony scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of domino harvey's life as a bounty hunter the story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable it seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting keira knightley does get totally naked in this one though that is the one and only upside to this film if you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple i strongly suggest that no one see this movie ever 3
<START> i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little i'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5 8 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun br br charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl ann marie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance br br all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film it's not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that it's just so cute and touching i know it's ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not they're just so loving and i think i'm going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone it's a fun movie to watch br br 7 10
<START> gee what a heck of a movie i said i wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades so i decided to start by this one it was a pretty adequate choice i entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces but i didn't see anything of the sort in this pastel coloured mess i haven't really watched many bad films before but i've got the feeling this is what's called so bad that's good probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny first of all there are the inaccuracies there are plot related inaccuracies physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies the latter in particular are as insane as van damme's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex extremely tacky lines exist too and i won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves there isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie except in one particular case geoffrey lewis looks completely pathetic as frank which is an utterly stupid character and to tell the truth i was actually very surprised to see that van damme did a decent job playing the twins he succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me but the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio which is now bankrupt
<START> might contain possible spoilers not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter br br why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion sure it's cheaper for them but after a while wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don't even remotely match up and iago is evil again since when i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films even the movie's musical number which had been disney's specialty for years stunk i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality
<START> every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap another plot twist comes along best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw this movie has a great deal more to recommend it br br sidney bruhl michael caine is a very unhappy man once a successful playwright his last several plays on broadway have flopped and while his wife myra dyan cannon is nothing but supportive in both the monetary and emotional sense this does little to make sidney feel any better to add insult to injury young playwright clifford anderson christopher reeve has just sent sidney a play to look at it's anderson's first and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over kill him and submit the play as his own she laughs with him at first but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action and her fears just may be justified br br it's a brilliant script there are twists and turns all through the plot and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end it's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there the entire time an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery br br the acting is excellent caine gives his usual excellent performance and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured refined and intellectual men reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems cannon's franticness works well for myra and irene worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic br br this is a film with an ending you'd never expect and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings an unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time and that is a real shame
<START> it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girl's wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl desi in the movie and her mom were the best actors i've been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a 25 year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
<START> oh wow i saw this film at the irish international film fleadh in manhattan on 12 march 2000 both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward what a gorgeous film although set in ireland amid catholic protestant antagonism the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun if this one does not get picked up in the usa it would truly be most unfortunate br br as for the stars and supporting players first rate they call orla brady the irish meryl streep i heard it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep they should be calling meryl the american orla brady and liam cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant br br see this movie
<START> the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three br br the story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave but for any wave at all j c sean pertwee is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe catherine zeta jones just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard the trouble is there are no waves until the very end of the film so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings br br the acting is mostly mediocre sean pertwee has a few comical moments but mostly his acting was mundane ewan mcgregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter gunn as terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag catherine zeta jones was sexy as usual but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability br br there is really not much here on which to comment i rated it a 3 10 it's a real beach bummer
<START> this movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that i have ever seen i am not a religious person but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience one suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life br br i must admit that when i first heard about this movie i was sceptical i thought the plot sounded contrived and i was afraid that the story would be banal but being a david lynch fan i decided to give it a go it took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie but then i was completely lost in it there is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie i left the cinema feeling that i had truly learned something valuable about life br br this is not a typical david lynch movie and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years on the other hand i am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because i also thought he managed that very well in the elephant man lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and i think the straight story is his best yet 9 5 10
