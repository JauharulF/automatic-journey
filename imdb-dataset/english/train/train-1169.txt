<START> page 3 is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of bhandarkar's films it is one sided and overly pessimistic this film is all about tabloid journalism gossip celebrities the film exposes the lives of socialites whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at funerals they are craving for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper's social column known as page 3 with huge photographs which will be the center of people's discussions they are attention seeking salacious and hypocrite the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers that's where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter madhvi sharma is thrown all these people from mumbai's elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvi's friends are no different from these high society people this was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting br br the film's music is average the only passable songs are kitne ajeeb and huzoor e ala sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is filmy very filmy the film's writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matter of fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse that's where the film has to be applauded it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharma's character's disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive atul kulkarni's part was very small but he did full justice to it boman irani is solid as the newspaper's editor sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvi's sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the film's ending is really well done and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous
<START> the basic hook here is lincoln is slow it is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation making him a great leader who is here engaged in single handedly civilizing the american frontier through the grand instrument of law all that john ford hooey and more including one lurking slave and extraneous death by injun however the 'slow' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie making funny and moving at extremes the history may be bunk but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true seeming moments check out henry fonda's big introductory stroll across the deck his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river his dalliance with mary todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows 'ma'am we've got to hurry ' things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama but fonda is priceless throughout
<START> if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 i don't know who they were i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one it's intelligent quirky neat wistful sweet gently subversive and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving never more so than in maggie smith's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene that's both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freeze frame on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest i would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie
<START> my title above says it all let me make it clearer if you have seen the bbc's planet earth which i am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much and i own all the discs of planet earth i had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it i was excited to check it out br br alas i went to the theater and the movie started i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear i recognized them from my dvds at home of planet earth br br the movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from planet earth br br we were very very disappointed as i think 90 of the footage is from planet earth i am saying 90 because some of the scenes i didn't recognize i have a feeling that i simply didn't remember them br br so finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of planet earth with a narration aimed at kids yes the narration is quite kiddish let me give you an example when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says the polar cubs are not like human kids they don't always listen to their mothers i don't remember the exact words but this is how it is so in a nutshell this is condensed planet earth for kids
<START> time and time again i've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film having said that though the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago so here's a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube the cure br br right away you can tell that the film is going for an avant garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups scopophilia and fast editing it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projects br br still despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at we're presented with a good use of props and locations good visual acting and some very atmospheric fluid editing which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a youtube submission the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening but what we are seeing here is avant garde storytelling at work you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie br br where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound what you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention br br so give it a watch but do it with the sound turned off br br last thought was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylor's red dwarf novel last human early in the film if you have the book you know what i mean
<START> this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but i'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone but i was wrong this time there are apparently many others
<START> faces are slashed throats are cut blood squirts and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die they even blow up kevin costner's dog with a shotgun why would anyone want to see a movie like this violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around take for instance underworld and underworld evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain in this movie the good guys are cut up see the difference why would anyone want to make a movie that depresses the audience beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse
<START> bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter it's vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint
<START> this might mean the end of the white race gasps a general as a dozen native zombies wander around the battlefields of europe during the great war an expedition sets out tor the long lost back projected city of kennif angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands br br it is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad from a previous decade it looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on 'how to act' br br chapter three emotions br br how to express fear and loathing female clench both fists place fist of one hand on heart open mouth as it to scream place other fist palm out against mouth hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob br br how to have difficult heavily emotionally charged scene with ex fiancÃ© explaining your love for someone else do not make eye contact do not move do not show any emotion do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall br br to give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors thus 35 minute's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes br br the revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow released from mental bondage the armies of ex zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window yea let's oh i dunnno yeah let's get him grrr frankenstein must be destroyed manana though i have just found a bit of hidden symbolism jagger is shot by a native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the natives being shot by the germans at the start of the flick see even downtrodden natives don't want the end of the white race the chase it you can call it that through the back projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone roy d'arcy has a hell of a time camping it up but is totally wasted as col mazovia br br there is one interesting moment in this film a nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell face after face cross fade into one another it works though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut i guess these must be neg cutters' frames between the fades br br best watched with friends and in a silly mood
<START> writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in chances are br br using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife's home many years later the plot takes unexpected delightful turns br br twenty four year old robert downey jr renders a delightful performance ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend br br this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper playing off one another with a graceful style i've watched this film a number of times on tv and each time found it most enjoyable
<START> wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore which was mainly laughable cgi but in acting atmosphere and direction br br the story was dreadful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish suggestible and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes br br the gory moments were clearly just a weak low self esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self conscious directing this film wasn't made for and audience it was made for a cv a deeply selfish motive
<START> i am so confused what in the world was this movie about what was the killer's motivation he seemed quite angry but i have yet to figure out why nothing in this movie made sense it had zero depth or less than zero depth which i guess would make it a hill or a pile of crap the acting was horrible when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that i had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise i can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again starting now seinfeld reference really though don't waste your time with this there's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks no one of the worst flicks of any kind that i have ever had the misfortune to watch and i've seen quite a few
<START> this film was so predictable that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent and there's some other big twist still coming however it doesn't he just continues to act creepy and she continues to ignore it mary found very incriminating evidence at his place and she still trusted him and what was that baiting the trap there was no trap she confronted him he said excuse me i have to go kill someone he left and that was the end of it they make attempts to use other suspects like that one older carnival girl at the end but they're completely underdeveloped actually all the characters are underdeveloped they have no depth and the setting is just plain strange who hangs out in a recycling factory its choppy and nothing is well developed for example when she leaves his place after having the beer and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car what was that her reactions weren't portrayed in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape but then all we see is her showering the next morning booooooooo it could have been so much better sooo much better
<START> lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together br br great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film yes its a sexy vampire story no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great but other than that br br for those who want to see sexy vampires only
<START> i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental outlet mentioned it to me being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u k i decided to check it out the film turned out be a dull amateurish and ugly looking ride the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept br br whatâs worse the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings soon one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again another still bed ridden is quickly disposed of after being forgotten for most of the duration the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house a harridan of a bible thumping mother cue horrendous overacting her repressed and long suffering daughter and the latterâs weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests br br often resorting to dinner table reminiscences by the man hating mother as a means of filling in the dreary to say nothing of unoriginal backstory and which invariably develop into mother daughter sparring contests the film does have one ace up its sleeve â the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time
<START> ok at the beginning it looked like shrek the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief then it evolves into something really compelling as the gauntlet is set and the result is an enjoyable movie which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch manny's past for example the premise has been obviously worked for a long time so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets only ice caps and rocks and three characters it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it as i said it can be tear jerking at some times so kids be warned the real letdown is the animation this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek and it shows the humans are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of cgi before but don't let this stain the record as a solo effort ice age is commendable and it will gather many fans i have no doubt oh and yes the moments with that small mouse are priceless and show stealing
<START> whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals br br or perhaps tvnz doesn't buy the good stuff please let that be what it is br br the writer's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichÃ©s niamh cusack's performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve baleful looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with br br of course this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation but that's not as important as the central character's failing marriage and its attendant problems is cusack's character's husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isn't a sign of insight it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job br br lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics evidently paula milne isn't up to the task
<START> war inc is a funny but strange film the actors are likable the film is likable also but i don't know how to describe the plot i will go into the plot later on this is a movie with some weird casting choices besides john cusack as a hit man which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked br br here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that her character is odd there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants and hits on hauser cusack there is a twist in the end involving the two characters it makes sense br br that is the only casting choice i am going into cause it just plain strange the whole movie is strange but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored here we have some of the best actors out there excluding miss duff she ain't great but here we have john cusack marisa tomeii joan cusack ben kingsley see what i mean br br this is the story of a hit man named hauser cusack he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif not the actor while trying to deal with his own personal problems he has to help out the wedding of a popstar played by hilary duff and he falls in love with a news reporter played by marisa tomeii there is a thing about the popstar though hauser is disgusted by her there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up br br the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming but that doesn't matter this is a strange funny and entertaining comedy i love most of the actors so really how could i not recommend it br br war inc 3 5 5
<START> it's a bad movie it seems like there is only 5 police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan's movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie it's like all the good guys died without a reason br br they story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think u s made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
<START> baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing smirk of a film that br br lasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes they br br are that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a br br short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame screenwriters of br br today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that br br overwhelms so many of their films br br the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first under br br and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her br br sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming happy ending br br but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to br br go so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a br br hapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one if br br you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable br br or rent the cassette it's worth the effort
