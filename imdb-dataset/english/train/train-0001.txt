<START> shown in australia as 'hydrosphere' this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden br br the infant 'muppet' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of 'total recall' there didn't seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie br br i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through br br malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money
<START> despite some occasionally original touches like the virtual sets that provide the background for the victorian interiors featuring ada lovelace and her circle this film falls short and ultimately disappoints newcomer francesca faridany seems talented but is wasted as emmy a character who by mid film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching lady ada narrate an autobiography 'conceiving ada' takes off briefly when lady ada tilda swinton appears the camera lingers on her facial expressions mannerisms even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible apporting into scenes to dramatize emmy's virtual rendering of her br br a straightforward biopic of ada lovelace would have been worthwhile but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both lady ada's life and that of a modern day computer scientist and her broadly drawn doltish boyfriend
<START> i hate reading reviews that say something like 'don't waste your time this film stinks on ice ' it does to that reviewer yet for me it may have some sort of naÃ¯ve charm if you like the other 'whistler' series films this one will be watchable if you like 40s noirish films this one will be watchable br br this film is not as good in my opinion as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist it's much slower and the plot is trite you've seen this same narrative device used in many other films and usually better br br but the acting is good and so is the lighting and the dialog it's just lacking in energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through br br the 'whistler' series is semi noir and there character mood lighting camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself but this film is not noir it's too light weight and hollywood innocent for that neither richard dix's character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end you just never knew until the end br br but still i'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing i've watched it at least twice myself and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times
<START> the problems with nikhil advani's salaam e ishq are many a one line concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier english film love actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing a well intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition a director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film kal ho na ho try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick the problem is what worked fabulously in kal ho na ho were the emotional excesses of the karan johar school of film making but here 'emotion' doesn't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen no not even cursorily the writer director gives us 'six relationships with one common problem love' but where is the intensity where is the depth where is the 'emotion' a 'tribute to love' sans emotion and one that goes on and on and on nah it just cannot work br br in my opinion the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be 'complete' it should in some way or the other follow the graph of the traditional three act structure screen writing guru syd field's paradigm that's the real reason why salaam e ishq didn't work for me none of the stories had any depth or a roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream hindi cinema also the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced it's not clear what salman khan is doing at ayesha takia's wedding if he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap up why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding that would be neater br br but yes some of the stories did have a lot of promise for one the anil kapoor juhee chawla story tries to address a very real situation mid life crisis but its journey is so linear that you're left wondering if it was really an issue similarly the problem of commitment in the akshaye khanna ayesha takia story is also true to life if only it was developed a little better i felt that the more promising stories in this mish mash were told from the male point of view which is fine but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters juhee chawla and ayesh takia in particular have all the depth of a half filled bath tub wasn't this film supposed to be about '12 different lives' now the actors john abraham still needs to learn acting while vidya balan is dependable and endearing as ever anil kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character since she didn't get a meaty character to portray juhee chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it akshaye khanna is fine despite going a trifle over the top in a few scenes ayesha takia has nothing much to do but she does remind us that she's the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in dor govinda tries to make up for that huge mistake called bhagam bhag and succeeds to a large extent br br that brings me the most irritating track of the film which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time salman khan and priyanka chopra the track is irritating mainly because of them but i must credit them for their consistency they're consistently bad all through the film priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming i don't buy the crap that her role that of an 'item girl' required her to act over the top somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming if you've seen rakhi sawant who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and bigg boss you'll know what i mean i strongly feel that if nikhil advani had taken rakhi sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like priyanka the story would have worked better salman khan's phony accent is well shannon esra's hindi is less accented than salman's br br to be fair to the director he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film i particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the anil kapoor juhee chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman but will anyone choose to paint their house in varying depressing shades of grey that's acceptable cinematic license i would say but when the film runs almost for 4 hours it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his 'touch' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences br br maybe nikhil advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible pata nahin kal ho na ho
<START> the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once
<START> this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of baltimore md and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag there are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film but who cares it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998
<START> the dvd version consists of 2 episodes the parricide of caesar being the juncture in addition the language was spanish without subtitles hence it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said br br cleopatra being an historic icon the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer leonor varela just plays fine she is strong willed but also a very supportive tender soul mate thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode so it is not really a documentary nor a peplum but a great love story br br after the parricide a new lover comes marc antoine but the flavor is gone we remember always our first love so i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully br br nonetheless the production is luxurious the sets are big tastefully decorated the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid the producers have a lot of money for sure but they spend nothing on the special effects they are so poor blue screens ships sphinx that it's funny br br finally i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies
<START> we had to go to an appointment so we turned on the dvr to record the ending after it was over i looked at my husband and said do you have a clue he shook his head no i said so you made me watch the end of this movie and i have no clue what just happened he didn't make me but you know br br the movie body itself was quite good there was a lot of suspense it kept you wondering then came the ending the ending was well it just ended you weren't let in on what happened or why right up until the credits i kept thinking something would happen to explain it but it never did so i came here expecting someone figured it out and i just wasn't paying attention nope here four years later i'm just as clueless as tom sawyer was br br i still have no clue what went on i'm just glad i didn't waste any to buy it because i sure would have been mad br br ohhhhh i get it the end of the movie is what disappeared rofl
<START> bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940's and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones br br bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards br br you have got almost everything in this movie the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf her sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela's house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie br br the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should i could let this slide it is after all a movie however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in nebraska i live in nebraska i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on first of all the small town that is talked about as the setting is the third largest city in the state with a population of around 50 000 grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver second the scenery for the movie is wrong grand island is in the platte river valley which is very flat with very few trees i tried watching this movie but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad this was a real event large sections of the city were wiped out in the book they talk about riding bikes from mormon island to fonner park i guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here http www theindependent com twisters
<START> i caught this at a test screening all i can say is what the hell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny br br the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop them br br that's about all the story there is the rest is over the top lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that's right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film
<START> a strong woman oriented subject after long director krishna vamsi's shakti the power the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi's first home production a story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice br br the story of the film revolves around nandini karisma kapoor who lives in canada with her two uncles tiku talsania jaspal bhatti there she meets shekhar sanjay kapoor falls in love with him and they soon marry their family is complete when nandini has a boy raja master jai gidwani but their happiness is short lived as the news of shekhar's ailing mother deepti naval makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india and that's when the problems start from the moment they reach br br india both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere they take a crowded train to reach shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station they have to catch a long bus drive to his village the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never ending drive and unfortunately for them a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus fortunately they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him after that they drive to the handing havel where shekhar''s father narsimha nana patekar lives with his wife deepti naval nandani realized that her father in law is in command as soon as she enters the place but her only solace is her mother in law's warm welcome br br living there nandini learns of her father in laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him the day she sees her father in law teach her son to throw a bomb she loses it and lashes out against him insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father in law her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart wrenching film br br what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie the only drawback is ismail darbar''s music which fails to rise above the script the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena which has been composed by anu malik another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors deepti naval too is in top form and her pr climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value though his role was not really required he's done it well overall shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr release hype is sure to get it a good opening shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch
<START> the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters explaining just enough to stay excited of course this show has some flaws in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there like rose and her husband where the hell are they what happened to them maybe they will return in later episodes but it is a little inconsistent that being said lost manages to be thrilling every episode especially the first two seasons that is a very hard thing to do i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show this is not a bad thing it even saves some episodes from getting boring one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters you will grow to love these characters good or bad but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure the danger of lost getting canceled due to declining ratings is near and that would be devastating
<START> i don't know what it is i find so endearing about this film but the first time i saw it i wanted to see how it ended i'm not a big fan of paul winfield nor of war dramas but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child all he knows is that the boy has green eyes truth be told i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while but this movie is somewhat of one man's odyssey after the pains of war winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me
<START> many have stated that orca Â killer whale is a jaws rip off this is not really true though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive propositions for film makers in the second half of the '70s orca Â killer whale would be better described as a modern day retread of moby dick it's a story about obsession on one hand a whale's obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty hunter's obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives sadly orca killer whale emerges a very disappointing film its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting br br shark hunter nolan richard harris encounters a marine life researcher rachel bedford charlotte rampling diving off the atlantic coast of canada their meeting almost ends in disaster when rachel's team are attacked by a great white shark but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark after this nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an aquarium but his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human worse still native umilak will sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer whaleÂ the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the arctic ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other br br two things stand out in this film one is the haunting score by ennio morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all time his talents wasted on various tenth rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye in every other department orca Â killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair bedraggled black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale his performance lacks the usual vitality rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long winded and ill informed explanations about the ways of whales the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale the plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery although it's credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd orca Â killer whale is really one for completists of the man vs beast cycle from the late 70s most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair
<START> detective tony rome frank sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it's a film that's played for ermÂlaughs while on a diving trip rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain waldo gronsky rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone the portly sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy raquel welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project the frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera director douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles there's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality it's a shameful shambles
<START> sorry i just didn't find the subject matter as compelling as the filmmaker did the robot guy and the mole rat guy were pretty interesting although morris didn't really tell us much about them the other two subjects were a bore and the supposed connections between them didn't hold up
<START> on 24 october 1955 the hard work geologist of the hadley oil company mitch wayne rock hudson meets the executive secretary lucy moore lauren bacall in the office of her boss bill ryan in new york and invites her to go to a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon kyle hadley robert stack on the way of the meeting he confesses that they had traveled from houston to new york to satisfy the wish of the reckless kyle who is his best friend since their childhood of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to kyle's father jasper hadley robert keith mitch and kyle immediately fall in love for lucy and kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress lucy then he opens his heart and proposes lucy they get married and travel to acapulco and the insecure kyle stops drinking meanwhile kyle's sister marylee dorothy malone is an easy woman and has a non corresponded crush on mitch that sees her as a sister one year later kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again the jealous marylee poisons kyle telling that his wife and mitch are having a love affair when lucy finds that she is pregnant kyle believes that the baby belongs to mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy br br written on the wind is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations there are at least two great movies with characters with drinking problem the lost weekend 1945 with stunning performance of ray milland and days of wine and roses 1962 with awesome performance of jack lemmon robert stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and clichÃ©s in the end the forgettable written on the wind is entertaining only and never a feature to be nominated to the oscar my vote is seven br br title brazil palavras ao vento words in the wind
<START> as with many other pop culture franchise series this line just didn't know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark br br this movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same br br after the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over br br it rates a 1 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this so called remake is terrible i went to see this tonight on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle but within the first half an hour we knew that this is a disaster it not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster the script had loopholes the editing was untidy quite a few times mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job amitabh was alright the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment lets not even get started about the new guy prashant one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this rajpal yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice nisha kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today all in all rgv who i thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors india has had failed miserably he took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it
