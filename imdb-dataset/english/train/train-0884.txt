<START> a special day ettore scola italy canada 1977 br br every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve this one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time it's surprising ettore scola's una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics time out calls it 'rubbish' and leonard maltin somewhat milder 'pleasant but trifling ' i disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist italy than most films i've seen the cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the film's relative unpopularity considering late '70s audiences weren't exactly spoiled with great italian films it's even stranger this one didn't really catch on with the critics br br the film begins with a ten minute collage of archive footage from hitler's visit to italy on may 8th 1938 set against this background we first meet antonietta loren a lonely love ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building one day when her beo escapes she meets her neighbour gabriele mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies he is well mannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him during the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings after the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist hypermodern at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we haven't met yet br br marcello mastrionani and sophia loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type canadian born john vernon plays loren's husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene i figure his voice must have been dubbed since he's not of italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so i cannot imagine he speaks italian if his voice has been dubbed i didn't notice at all on the contrary he's completely believable as an italian even more than the rest of the cast the story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn't come off as overly pretentious but works completely don't miss out on this one br br camera obscura 9 10
<START> i usually comment only on movies that i like figuring everyone to his her own taste but here i want to make an exception the premise of this movie which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle is that these two self centered adults have a perfect right to go off to las vegas get drunk get married and inflict incalculable suffering upon their respective broods of children even allowing for the culturally sanctioned inebriation they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion after all love is all that's important isn't it to hell with everybody else whether or not things work out in the end is really not the point in fact it's quite irrelevant the point is that disrespect for others especially if they are young persons and especially if they are in a position of dependency is made light of and thereby reinforced by this movie there are far more innocuous behaviors these parents could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat
<START> kenneth branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of shakespeare's most classic and well written tragedy kenneth plays the role of hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears kate winslet's performance is also of great note
<START> thankfully he hasn't yet this is crude simplistic student politics made into drama it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits conceit 1 that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left conceit 2 that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister's only critics are sinister civil servants mi5 big business and the americans naturally conceit 3 that this radical socialist pm can solve all union economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation conceit 4 that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing conceit 5 that the soviet union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's and finally conceit 6 that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against britain br br it's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises when it was made television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience ray mcinally's performance was great which is one of the few plus points history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show
<START> i've seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films but i don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did br br the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectively br br the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched what's worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable br br harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie ain't that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema
<START> a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980's when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday don't expect more you won't find it it's great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
<START> what a boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter in law karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasn't too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of it br br the best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was a piece of crap
<START> i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section to tell you the truth the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs but it turned out to be semi gore flick somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film however the story is rather weak but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch that more than anything else really scared the crap out of me br br the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q a session i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future br br this one is strictly for genre fans but i'd recommend non fans to give this a try anyway it was a fun ride
<START> this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience br br the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story and who could forget pax the beautiful guide dog in the series br br whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings in new orleans the acting and the music i note the comment about the music score in other comments i remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even better br br well you never know one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd
<START> i was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the maryland film festival i've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle so this was definitely a must see for me br br this is about the life and work of william castle who in my opinion was an underrated director true he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films but he added something to these films real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore for example he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in the tingler br br this is truly a well made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema it also paints castle as a larger than life character who was very well liked and had a smile on his face br br unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians spine tingler shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work such as john waters john landis and joe dante a must see for classic horror and sci fi fans
<START> i was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised i looked closer and noticed that peter falk and paul reiser were in it having watched mad about you once i was not a fan of paul reiser however i am a big fan of peter falk so the spouse and i took a chance we were both swept into this story the beautiful scenery the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today not that sappy emoted junk but real life situations from real life like people i even have to say paul reiser was excellent although i still won't watch mad about you i don't know where this movie has gone i heard it was put out in limited release it should be shared with the world it is one of the finest movies i have seen m
<START> given the title this first follow up to quartet 1948 obviously reduces the number of w somerset maugham stories which comprise the film the author still turns up to introduce the episodes but thereâs no epilogue this time around by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r c sheriff here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as noel langley though itâs unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison as can be expected much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment â though this also extends to at least three cast members namely naunton wayne wilfrid hyde white and felix aylmer the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled âthe colonelâs ladyâ while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running time itâs still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain br br âthe vergerâ tells of a church sexton james hayter â for which the storyâs title is another word â whoâs dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest michael hordern simply because heâs illiterate rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife his landlady played by kathleen harrison but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered â and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain the last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of hayterâs lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were â to which the wealthy and respected tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger br br the second episode âmr know allâ is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man nigel patrick british despite his foreign sounding name of kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most â the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrickâs attentions to his pretty wife anne crawford during a fancy dress party however the passengers decide to enact their ârevengeâ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him a jest which he naturally doesnât appreciate still itâs here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character â told by crawford that the necklace sheâs wearing is an imitation wayne challenges patrick to name its priceâ¦but the latter realizes immediately that itâs the genuine article and that this would compromise crawfordâs position if he were to tell so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer br br as can also be deduced from the title âsanatoriumâ deals with the myriad patients at such a place â run by andre' morell the protagonist is a new intern roland culver who wistfully observes the various goings on the narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot â one humorous the âfeudâ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium played by finlay currie and john laurie one melodramatic the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies and one bittersweet the romance between naÃ¯ve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a âliferâ while rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar
<START> about twenty minutes into this movie i was already bored quite simply these characters were fairly dull occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn't bad at all however it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes so i would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast i'd call this a disappointment
<START> the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the year's best
<START> and possibly closest to the dickens story line although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch who's idea was that period hair surely they could have done better than that scott does an incredible job as scrooge his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present i find g c scott's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it' is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact he's phenomenal here nearly the entire cast is incredible the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday enjoy
<START> oh dear lord they've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest br br the original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero kowalski he was a man trying to drive from denver to san fransisco to win a bet why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers we're not really sure br br we had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point that point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together and the road itself vanishes he lives only to be free and means no ill on anyone we saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on even the cops that were chasing him br br when he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity he died like he lived running wide open br br in the remake kowalski has a whole history including a first name even he's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy he is a devoted husband and excited expectant father he comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers they even gave the part of super soul the blind dj brilliantly portrayed by clevon little in the original to jason priestly give me a break
<START> i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent short history of nearly everything and what i was able to choke down in a brief history of time it sounded interesting at times however the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually channelling some loony named ramtha completely upset the applecart for me br br what a waste of two hours
<START> my name is julia ross is a mesmerizing 1945 b thriller from joseph h lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of hollywood noir films this 65 minute gothic oddity from columbia pictures came after lewis' lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns east side kids comedies horror melodramas including the incredibly bizarre bela lugosi shocker the invisible ghost and standard studio b product secrets of a co ed bombs over burma the falcon in san francisco etc all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive mr lewis my name is julia ross as well as so dark the night from the following year introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets later lewis productions like gun crazy 1949 and the big combo 1955 despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon deft lucid camera work and effective low key lighting and very modest resources br br my name is julia ross probably owes more to the tradition of british mysteries it's set in a studio bound england than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings a young woman nina foch agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman dame mae witty two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identity that of the old woman's daughter in law told that she's been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament but before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing george macready most probably murdered his real wife and that she's been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that lewis brings to the production marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director
<START> neil simon has quite a body of work but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame this film really works jack lemmon walter matthaw have a great chemistry the supporting cast for this film is stellar as well br br it is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets the script bristles with humor from this situation this had been done in some forms previously this is the one that brings it all together in a very good package br br simon has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this
<START> so many educational films are nothing more than mind numbing drudgery saved only by the fact that mst3k mocks them why study industrial arts comes to mind hemo the magnificent is actually quite well done it's all about blood the heart and the circulatory system i admit that i don't remember everything from it but it does a good job explaining everything keeping it serious but entertaining i guess that you can always count on june foray most famously the voice of rocky the squirrel she plays a deer here br br since hemo the magnificent itself may be hard to find probably the best place to see it is in gremlins a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming
