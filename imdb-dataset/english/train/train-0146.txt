<START> bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos' first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manouever br br looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place some seemingly perilous but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment br br tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st's themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run both compositionally and in terms of acting br br 'nuff said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order
<START> this film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success trying to be ever upwardly mobile working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home br br his was infatuated with her at first going to the dance class just to idolize her but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing it eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death there is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejected br br there is also revelations of various characters including the girl he initially admired giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it br br the dancing was also engaging with the big competition at the end but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it instead there are downfalls revelations and redemption br br all these makes it a moving and fun film to watch
<START> i very much enjoyed the revolution will not be televised it gave me once again a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed br br it is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades if not centuries however when their coup failed after the interim government dissolved the supreme court and the constitution and the ombudsman and the electoral boards and all civil rights no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them they haven't even gone to jail the major plotters are living in florida carrying on and the protection that they had was the bolivarian constitution passed by a large majority of the venezuelan people it is not only history that bites democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose and in venezuela it is loose
<START> as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this dispensable period piece has little going for it it's overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution's fickle hand of justice eric rohmer at 82 it shows
<START> this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman the three girls that play jodie's friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
<START> pros akshay kumar's performance is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump ab in their movies together some touching scenes in the 2nd half br br cons the whole 1st hour the jokes were flat to say the least every scene involving rajpal yadav major stupidity in ab's decision making let me get this straight he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth wtf he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer but thinks insulting him will make him stronger am i the only one who doesn't see the logic here easily the movie's biggest flaw br br akshay becoming a stunt man lmao we're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba but when the time arrives to support himself and his pregnant wife he becomes a stunt man lol how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field or heck anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger this is some incredibly dumb writing br br the ending i hate this sort of melodramatic crap everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab's character which i couldn't the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh which i hate this please feel sorry for the guy with the illness crap has run its course i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd the whole thing br br bottomline waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense give 'em some decent song picturizations fancy outfits plenty of glycerin filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap up crap like this
<START> i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this 'classic'
<START> it's true that danny steinmann's the unseen is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single clichÃ© the genre has brought forward over the decades but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film on the contrary my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival but their hotel forgot to register their booking in their search for a place to stay the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house the unseen can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics psycho and the texas chainsaw massacre the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films like twisted family secrets in the cellar voyeurism crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens still i don't consider these to be negative remarks as the unseen is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house unseen like the title promised the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre sydney lassick immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in one flew over the cuckoo's nest is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed also stephen furst who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen gives away a tremendous performance as junior he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving the unseen is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff
<START> yes even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice this show is pretty bad i didn't mind the first couple of shows but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show br br ryan you can have trista she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around very media savvy but i doubt there's much more there br br i haven't really watched any of the shows since apart from the occastional re run on daytime tv i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as entertaining trash view it as something you can laugh over and don't have to think too hard about i don't watch csi its like reality tv tired and clichÃ©d but you have to think too much anyway while watching br br a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show at the very first 'the woman tell all woman such as amy who had a lot of class about her commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her hey amy how about joining a club getting a hobby doing charity work changing your job to one where you meet more guys gees all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner br br amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting the perfect man' clue to ladies he doesn't exist there are however many great guys out there that would make great husbands some who may be right for you they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike but they are great guys all the same the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable im still a youngster at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner this show is proving otherwise br br overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun nothing is manned more between the couples than a simple night out the bachelor sadly takes itself way too seriously
<START> loved this film real people great acting humour unpredictable the characters were believable and you really connected with them if you're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other this would be a good choice
<START> this might contain a spoiler so beware br br if it had been 200 000 thousand or two million people does it make a difference sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of strangely very loud americans but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone god help us for what we have done after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us how then can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will we are contradictory and hypocritical and i am ashamed for this i feel sorrow for the people affected they deserve justice and their homes back if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety i don't want it i denounce these actions and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit no one is above the law i want my country back and so do the chagos islanders regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports we can't stand to be stuck in traffic let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes 'not one of us brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed and preserved when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000 we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men
<START> the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer br br otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
<START> i actually like this movie even though i don't fancy james belushi very much in this movie you can actually see several big names on the rise linda hamilton and courteney cox namely caine's was already big of course the plot in this movie is simple its just like that sliding door movie it however was told in a light hearted manner and i like the comedy moments in it it made me trying to relive my own important moments in live eg what if i've taken that girl out for a movie and not the other etc it tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change it also reminds us to be careful what we wish for life is not always as good on the other side as we think maybe what we have now is the best for us all things considered
<START> up until the last 20 minutes i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan's worst movie excluding his pre 1978 work which i am not familiar with the final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense indeed one of the highlights of chan's career but to get to it you have to sit through a lot of comedy that might amuse five year olds oh look someone threw a tomato at that guy's face and endless football scenes not to mention the dubbing which includes the line how can i turn it off it's not a tap watch to find out what it refers to dragon lord is worth renting for the final fight alone but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies
<START> mcconaughey in a horror thriller i had to see this i was pleasantly surprised br br the plot is told in flashback mode and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament i can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie sorry just know that if you decide to watch it you'll be in the very least surprised br br all the main players are very good bill paxton did a great job directing those kids and his acting is awesome mcconaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly br br this movie challenges you to think is dad crazy is there a god do demons exist how far would you go to right a wrong and what is right anyway i'm still thinking br br and thus i recommend frailty 7 10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second or even third viewing
<START> this two part tv mini series isn't as good as the original from 1966 but it's solid the original benefited from a huge number of things it was all in black and white it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations including the home of the doomed clutter family that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itself br br this remake was filmed in canada which i guess doubles okay for kansas the story tries to be as sympathetic to perry as it dares to and eric roberts plays him as a somewhat fey person his homosexuality barely hidden the gentler take by roberts doesn't quite work in the end though because it's hard to believe that his version of perry smith would just finally explode in a spasm of murder whereas robert blake's take on smith left you no doubt that his perry smith was an extremely dangerous character br br anthony edwards was excellent as the bombastic big mouthed and ultimately cowardly dick hickcock the brains of the outfit his performance compares very well to scott wilson's role in the original movie br br since this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the clutter family and in this regard i think the 1996 movie has an advantage the clutters are just an outstanding decent family they've never harmed another soul and it is just inexplicable that such a decent family is ultimately massacred in such a horrifying way it still boggles my mind that after the clutters were locked in the bathroom that herb clutter didn't force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape this movie has the thought occur to him but too late from what i read about the real home which is still standing the way the bathroom is configured they could've opened the counter drawers and effectively barricaded the door which would've forced the killers to blast their way in but it might've bought time for some of the clutters to escape why the clutters didn't try this i have no idea br br fans of the book will recognize that this movie takes a lot of liberties with how the crime is committed but not too serious still it's distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case the actors playing the cops led by sam neill and leo rossi are uniformly excellent much better i think as a group than the actors in the original movie they know that to secure the noose around the necks of both of them they have to get them to confess and the officers come to the interview impeccably prepared they had already discovered the likely alibi the phony story of going to fort scott and had debunked every jot of it the officers then let smith hickcock just walk into their trap hickcock is a b s artist who figures he can convince anyone of anything and the officers respectfully let him tell his cover story but when they lower the boom on him he shatters very quickly it's very well filmed and acted and very gratifying to watch because the viewer naturally should loath hickcock in particular by this point a cowardly con man who needs the easily manipulated smith to do his killing for him supposedly hickcock later stated that the real reason for the crime wasn't to steal money from the clutters but to rape nancy clutter at least she was spared that degradation br br the actors playing the clutters are very good kevin tighe as herb clutter in particular the story sensitively deals with mrs clutter's emotional problems most likely clinical depression and mrs clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone from what i've read the clutters' surviving family was particularly bothered by how bonnie clutter was portrayed in the book claiming it was entirely untrue but as an aside both of the killers related to the police how mr clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness capote might make up that fiction to make the character of bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to falsely portray mrs clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book duplicated in the movies is right off the taped confessions of the killers so it would've been nonsensical for herb to have said that and not have it be true
<START> i finally watched these episodes in 2008 and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird eerie people that pay attention to things boo scary bush's frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles bush 'accidentally' executing someone no wait he did sort of do that as gov this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time but must now be considered as brilliant if spooky prescience
<START> the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing but sit tight because you are in for the ride of your life the concept is compelling with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story there are fine performances all around with phillip seymour hoffman's being the best of the cast no surprise there ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well the direction by mr lumet is outstanding the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film
<START> 'cry freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth br br the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko's death br br although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods' i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting
<START> curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didn't rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin' good and with all the flash backs and flash forwards i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy renner's performance wasn't too bad you can catch him in s w a t in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop anyway i would rate this as a 1 10 it only got a 1 because of renner's so so performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer's crimes avoid this one
