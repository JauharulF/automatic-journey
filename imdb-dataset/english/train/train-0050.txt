<START> although i had seen gymkata in a theater way back in '85 i couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of kurt thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending br br after reading some of the other reviews i picked up a copy of the newly released dvd to once again enter the world of gymkata br br it turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today the film stars champion gymnast kurt thomas as jonathan cabot recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of parmistan to enter and hopefully win the game a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like yak power the goal of the mission involves the star wars defense system jonathan is trained in the martial arts by princess rubali who never speaks or leaves the house once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white needless to say cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of parmistan on his way to a date with destiny and the game br br star kurt thomas was ill served by director robert clouse who it looks like was never on the set the so called script is just this side of incompetent see other reviews for the many howlers throughout the town of crazies has a few good moments but is ultimately ruined by bad editing the ending meh still there's the germ of a good action adventure here a hong kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good
<START> i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 2005 i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it i've seen thousands of movies very few are hypnotic to me i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable ray liotta to be hypnotic so consider the source as you read this i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was who has been credited by many for launching hollywood i had no idea what i was in for two hours later i snapped out of it and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen playing a role perfectly suited to her imagine a movie fan in 1922 having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before you would have to see her again and again the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive she was a poor squatter couldn't speak the king's english but you had to admire her what a movie time to start my mary pickford movie collection
<START> apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of europe including germany hungary and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the hitler and stalin era nuremberg and a lot of forgotten trials all over europe was a revenge and injustice of the winners what do you think why were not any american british french or soviet defendants after the wwii there were no american british etc war crimes there were no hiroshima no nagasaki no tokyo no dresden no hamburg no berlin no katyn and so on the germans had war crimes too but in nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration the main point was vae victis germany must perish that was also a book title in america 1941 br br this film is an awful ignoble american brainwashing instrument full of error lie propaganda prejudice and injustice and first of all full of hypocrisy but not surprisingly why wasn't enough the nuremberg process itself this film is a nightmare total darkness after 60 years this darkness and hate and narcissism and lack of self criticism is the real cause of the massacres in korea vietnam cambodia serbia iraq and so forth and there are no american war criminals bravo america very clever even stalin would become envious of it
<START> very slight spoiler br br this movie despite being only on tv is absolutely excellent i didn t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so i can t really comment on that the acting in this was so good i had to pinch myself and say remember it s only a movie this didn t really happen as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting the offhanded comments and burns from john were right on with his character especially in the restaurant as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie it s a wicked experience for any beatles fan and prepare for a few surprises
<START> in one respect it's like 'the wizard of oz ' with paris in black and white and the riviera in color but it's supposedly about possessive love destructiveness and moral decadence while actually being about designer gowns shots of the riveria lots of big expensive cars and music and dancing interludes that suggest vincente minnelli on one of his off days watchable but a remarkable example of desperate dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions was this the model for 'the talented mister ripley does anyone sense an affinity between jean seberg and matt damon
<START> i bought this dvd without any previous reference but the names of john huston raquel welch mae west and farrah fawcett on its cover i found the brazilian title very weird but i decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like switch however the non sense story is awful and hard to be described myron breckinridge rex reed is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in copenhagen and he returns to hollywood telling that she is to be myra breckinridge raquel welch and claiming half the property of his uncle buck loner john huston along the days myra and her alter ego myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle's academy with kinky sex in a certain moment the messy screenplay is so confused that i believe the whole story was only a mind trip of myron induced by the accident unfortunately the beauties of raquel welch and farrah fawcett are not enough to hold this flick my vote is three br br title brazil homem mulher atÃ© certo ponto man woman up to a point
<START> the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap most of the singing is off key i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end '
<START> martin sheen michelle phillips stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death mr sheen mr margolin and mr morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles ms phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made for tv movie twenty five years ago by supplying the sex interest in an otherwise sexless film the real star however is the california kid a 1934 ford coupe borrowed from jake jacobs put before a camera and given a workout that'll leave the viewer panting gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation br br the action scenes are spectacular although some of the dialog is a bit lame making for a fine evening's diversion this is how all car movies should be made br br try to catch this one on the late movie channel it's well worth the missed sleep
<START> when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie br br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough br br film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia br br second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion br br third final chapter is not special or interesting it's regular like other action movies br br finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you'll love it enjoy d
<START> this is one of those movies like dave american dreamer and local hero that holds a viewer's interest time and again lightweight movies seldom win oscars but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop true all the drama is melodrama but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg now why can't i write sh t like that i think it's unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation
<START> i went to see hamlet because i was in between jobs i figured 4 hours would be great i've been a fan of branagh dead again henry v i was completely overwhelmed by the direction acting cinematography that this film captured like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly branagh doesn't play hamlet he is hamlet he was born for this when i watch this film i'm constantly trying to find faults i've looked at the goofs and haven't noticed them how he was able to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me this movie was shot in 70 mil it's a shame that columbia hasn't released a widescreen version of this on vhs i own a dvd player and i'd take this over titanic any day so columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched and i don't know what happened at the oscars this should have swept best picture best actor best direction best cinematography what films were they watching i felt sorry for branagh at the oscars when he did a tribute to shakespeare on the screen they should have been giving a tribute to branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time
<START> i just watched this movie in one word sucky the story is bad the acting is if possible even worse the movie has one or two nice moments but thats it and having those two small good moments doesn't make up for anything in between before or after those moments a montrocity of a movie not even worth watching on tv
<START> n b spoilers within assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director's mind but directing a wagner opera is an especially tricky task as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold hans jurgen syberberg loads this filming of parsifal wagner's final masterpiece with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams you get more than a piece of the director you get the whole fatted hog and then some syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of german history but does it work to meld that desire to a wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts br br the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism these are drawn come from wagner's own time from long before and go well beyond if you know what these things mean they can enrich syberberg's vision for you but not necessarily enhance wagner's vision if you don't know what they mean they're simply confusing if not annoying i won't bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles practices and pageantry of christianity the theme of redemption plays the main role here as in nearly every wagner opera br br i personally had to sweat to get through syberberg's first act amidst my jarring acclimation the music saved the day but act ii picks up the pace here we meet klingsor the evil sorcerer out to entrap the wandering innocent fool parsifal the greatest seductress of them all kundry will be used to entice him to the dark side after an initial dalliance with more symbols these get stripped away and the long gorgeous transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off finally the film starts working a genuine magic and it is chiefly due to syberberg's choosing to set things naturally and simply suddenly the acting starts to work the expressive actress edith clever and the luscious soprano of yvonne minton team to create a wondrous kundry suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid in other words wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms and it works beautifully for me it was the most engrossing part of the film br br with the re entrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in some other loony syberberg ideas using a huge wagner death mask as a major set piece causing the composer's protuberant proboscis to loom comically large dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes wigs and makeup what is the director saying that the knights are a bunch of buffoons that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions it's anybody's guess the insertion Â just after the incredibly touching baptism of kundry by parsifal Â of rear projection footage of the conductor rehearsing in modern day realism his orchestra in the studio this completely snapped my dramatic thread requiring a few minutes to regroup the complete avoidance of having any time pass between acts ii and iii when we meet the knight and narrator gurnemanz again he should be an old old man and parsifal should re emerge as a world weary but wiser middle aged man but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the parsifal character into male female components some find this the most brilliant stroke no doubt i can credit karin krick who plays parsifal 2 with acting of strength and dignity she also happens to be the best lip syncher of the whole cast but please wagner's conception of parsifal is already so complex his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what amfortas's eternal wound means and how it has become his own to his return as the great redeemer of act iii Â this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character the bi sexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd and what's with this nonsense about a homoerotic gurnemanz and parsifal can't we just accept a mentor apprentice relationship which is marvelously reversed in act iii br br the monte carlo philharmonic under armin jordan plays with passion and beauty though the chorus is disappointing but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my solti led recording highly recommended and get my wagnerian bearings straight again the film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating to syberberg's credit he's created a visually arresting work and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera but instead of sticking to parsifal he seems to have wanted to bring in all things wagnerian the man the life the enormous influence all of it in crude symbolic code parsifal the opera is already full of weighty symbolism the grail the spear the holy sacraments baptism amfortas's ever bleeding wound klingsor's self castration the kiss kundry's curse and on and on this is not to mention the musical symbolism sounding constantly in the score in the form of wagner's leitmotif system parsifal itself is one huge symbol getting back to my first paragraph question syberberg's whole hog is all way too much for me but if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy then go for it i won't recommend just staying away from this you may find yourself heartily satisfied or if you need something to crack your wagner barrier try it but please please don't stop here parsifal is in a late very ripe league of its own
<START> i'm a big fan of morgan freeman 'the shawshank redemption' ranks at the top of my all time favorite movies but i have to admit that i have often wondered about his choice of roles so many of his titles were big budget clichÃ©s with no heart '10 items or less' for me marks the return of freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents br br freeman plays an unnamed formerly big time hollywood actor who hasn't worked in several years he has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in la after being stranded there by his flaky driver freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl scarlet paz vega whom he has semi befriended before she can take him home however scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to and freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride br br the movie follows scarlet and freeman to several locations but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two freeman is the quintessential disconnected hollywood type who hasn't heard of target and doesn't know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is he spouts wisdom from the dalai lama filtered thru his 'the whole world is but a stage' mentality and repeatedly calls scarlet's job interview an 'audition' and yet he has a way with people a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame he is a fan of humanity he studies them asks incessant questions about them and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed in scarlet he sees the stubborn proud loner that he was he sees the man he used to be br br scarlet for her part displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself vega plays the role with a connection to freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction although she plays it beautifully and it's not at all as creepy as it sounds but even as she feels her connection to freeman grow scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru freeman's hollywood bull hit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth br br the movie is smart funny and well written with dialogue that is simple but effective i read one imdb review that said the lines were 'stilted' which i think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech there are no big soliloquies here no deep soul searching moments and so the trick is i think to show how people in ordinary everyday life can forge connections with one another and i think freeman and vega pull it off beautifully painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean ethereal and elusive long after it's gone it lives on in your memories tantalizing you with what might have been ok that was a bit flowery but i really did like the performances and the movie i would definitely recommend it
<START> they had me from the first show br br welcome to trinity county a sleepy little mayberry like place with one slight difference the sheriff is really satan there's the spoiler not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway br br oh but that's not all it turns out that satan has a son named caleb some people are trying to keep him good but it's an uphill battle sheriff buck satan knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness subtle sneaky he doesn't always come off as evil most of the time he's a hero everyone owes him a big favor because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it so every time you think someone will finally take him down one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it br br in one of my favorite episodes lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil br br the robber ted was hesitant to shoot them lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience if he had no conscience he would have shot them by now if he had a real conscience he never would have become a criminal so he started calling him half ted it was pretty funny he was taunting the criminals and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half ted at all times and of course he was in complete control at all times they actually had you favoring satan br br very very excellent show it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural br br that's good company
<START> paris je t'aime 2006 is a film made up of 18 segments you can do the math 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story the movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time the premise works almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near great actors br br there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to pick one or two favorites probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment place des victoires gena rowlands as an aging beauty in quartier latin catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment loin du 16Ã¨me and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris 14Ã¨me arrondissement segment br br special mention must be given to gulliver hecq probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station segment tuileries br br this is an outstanding movie my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed however paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen in any case don't miss it
<START> what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional br br even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish it was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the f k out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds whoo hoo dumb film poor madsen he will bounce back
<START> this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted it is a beautiful thing there were a lot of quality one liners this movie blew uncle sam out of the water it was made by tha same people i think
<START> as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent ' by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her
<START> the sun was not shining it was too wet to play so i went to the movies that cold cold wet date day br br the cat in the hat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick br br mike myers played the cat his humor was lame and kids needn't see this the humor was not tame br br the film was like drinking milk from a rabid cow so it is fun to have fun yet the filmmakers didn't know how br br this film in short is atrocious the acting was bad the plot was tweaked too much and the humor was surprisingly very crude br br it starts with conrad and sally a rule breaker and a future sheriff when their mother has to go to work she gets mrs kwan to babysit possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs kwan is watching a taiwanese court room a la c span she soon falls asleep and here comes the cat br br the film starts to spiral out of control the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun he's got thing 1 and thing 2 who suddenly start trashing the house he improvises a tv infomercial and accidentally slices his tail off and when the cat goes full carmen miranda it's not funny possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat br br too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or chopping your tail off br br soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog who has the key to a crate on his collar if the crate is not locked soon their house will be home to the cat's universe here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film br br the acting overall is horrible mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat saying things like you dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata spencer breslin is great as the trouble making conrad and dakota fanning is cute as sally though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter accident waiting to happen alec baldwin's slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting ever trying to woo the kids mom who is played by kelly preston and sean hayes is mr humberfloob mom's boss and is also the voice of the fish the latter three are also bland br br overall if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor cause there's plenty of it and more save your 7 00 and see something else as the late great dr seuss once said br br it is fun to have fun but you have to know how really universal stop theodore's already turning over in his grave br br like my mom always says curiousity killed the cat the cat in the hat out of
