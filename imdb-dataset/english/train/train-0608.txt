<START> i have had the pleasure of reading martin torgoff's book can't find my way home which is chock full of info on the drug culture of america spanning the years 1945 2000 this guy knows his stuff i found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary i particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era and the 70's stoner culture the soundtrack was excellent whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with lsd forever changed american culture as we know it one thing that was missing was any mention of george jung played by johnny depp in the movie blow who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's 80's
<START> panic is a captivating blurred genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist his love of wife and son his duty to his employer father with his own identity although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending it is a superb production in almost all aspects the characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences
<START> did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here now let s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right wrong this is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments it might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but i found damon wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief does he speak like that in real life if he does then he has my sympathy but he won t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
<START> the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth hearing david lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works that they settle for less this appears to be such an example
<START> have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtz's character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have br br the bottom line obvious plot one note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors
<START> ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she can't remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone else's i can't imagine they all had a coke problem whatever it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her
<START> i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made and simply is it's one and a half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girls br br sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror movie and i usually like horror movies i've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever it's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque it's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too br br the worst thing if the above wasn't bad enough for ya about this movie is that they've tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap hand held cameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film there's no other explanation than hey ya'll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound wise or other wise br br than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock br br my advise don't watch this under any circumstances
<START> a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read mark twain br br 'classic' seems to be the word used to describe scarface brian depalma's 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among florida's drug ring people and critics and rappers for that matter deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films ' when it is anything but it is praised for all the wrong reasons scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public br br first off the film is about a cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness simple yes but the layers of de palma's directing genius and the great story written by oliver stone yes i know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it the characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film they are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse 'tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie all those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves and that is why the film works so well the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers brian de palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans br br next on the film is an adult drama it is not a 'gangster film' it has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point it's not like aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people ridiculous hogwash if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is not a promotion of it br br this being said the film is indeed a great film it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story it has a very dramatic score in true giorgio moroder style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears the film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts the acting is terrific al pacino enough said he can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception pretty boy steven bauer as manny i didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palma's direction michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony's sister gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate paul shenar as alejandro sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and shenar portrays him as so and miriam colom as tony and gina's torn mother these three dig the film as deep as it can go br br this reviewer learned one main thing when watching scarface for the first time always go into a film unsuspecting all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see only knowing de palma like i do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds so ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of bailey's on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real scarface
<START> in the winter of 1931 supposedly 12 year old tyler hoechlin as michael sullivan jr wonders what his mobster father tom hanks michael mike sullivan does for a living young hoechlin follows mr hanks to work one evening and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters this leads in a very roundabout way to godfather type paul newman as john rooney hiring independent hit man jude law as harlen maguire to track down hoechlin and hanks who are off to cool their heels in chicago hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work br br looking uncannily like paul peterson the donna reed show hoechlin does a terrific job for director sam mendes and getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002 but the most striking thing about road to perdition is the stunning cinematography of conrad l hall which deservedly won a career capping academy award for the late photographer mr hall's work is truly superlative this helps make up for the overall impression of a measured contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals the deviating end is abruptly uplifting the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess br br road to perdition 7 12 02 sam mendes tom hanks tyler hoechlin paul newman jude law
<START> sam kleinman peter falk comes to his son's place unexpectedly his son ben kleinman paul reiser is quite surprised to hear that his mother muriel kleinman olympia dukakis has left his father ben's wife rachel elizabeth perkins and his three sisters try to find muriel while ben and his father go see a farmhouse that's for sale but that's not the end of their journey their road trip turns into a long therapy session between ben and his father raymond de felitta is the director of the thing about my folks 2005 paul reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job the dialogue between ben and sam is just amazing and he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it's this good who would be better man to play the father than peter falk nobody i can tell you that and i really love the story on why paul wanted peter falk for the part peter was an actor who made his own father laugh and peter certainly made me laugh in this movie it's just hilarious when they go fishing and how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick the movie is often very funny and i found myself laughing several times but it can also be touching from time to time you couldn't tell a story any better than it is told here
<START> why aren't more films especially american more like meatball machine br br this is my first official on line review and i am charged with electrical ecstasy after having chosen meatball machine as my first endeavor this is a review so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion br br i mean this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo so what if it's not all original i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore thank you jesus for japanese cinema br br simply put the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end this time at 31 my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring br br in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood humans become flesh eating cyborgs there's more fight scenes great music great point of view shots decent acting by the woman cyborg at least better than her male counterpart the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times br br oh and did i forget to mention it's a love story wow i hate love stories but this takes the cake br br i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces sadly i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine br br lastly my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless normally she says something like why are you watching that junk this time she had nothing to say i was glad br br this is not junk this isn't just splatter splatter for the sake of splatter is also great this is art my friends art br br chacho
<START> i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie i thought everyone was very good i was not familiar with richard lewis i thought he made his character julian peters very personable funny and attractive sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo john candy has a field day as the bon vivant james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife delightful ensemble cast lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations just a nice pick me up for a dreary day especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon
<START> ludicrous angelic 9 year old annakin turns into whiny brat 19 year old annakin who somehow seems appealing to amidala 5 years his senior now 22 year old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams and so takes to slaughtering children his friends and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a his precious wife might really die and b only he can prevent this ludicrosity squared br br i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention the story is ridiculous the characters are unbelievable literally not the perverted sense of fantastic wonderful etc br br obi wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he hacks off annakin's legs lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living as it turns out br br i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations none of that here the story could have been written by a 10 year old br br oh yeah the cgi is pretty cool
<START> proximity tells of a convict lowe who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him this very ordinary film is an action drama with a weak plot stereotypical poorly developed characters and a one dimensional performance by lowe a forgettable film not worthy of further commentary
<START> i admired rob marshall for chicago but memoirs of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and asian arts overall the scene is beautiful but after restless emphasis on exoticism oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them the excessive cherry blossom was frankly overdone it's probably the cultural difference of perception here the ultimate beauty is not the showy type as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie br br some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws as a taiwanese i have no doubt the actress are great an actor actress can play any kind of role when he she can look like it gong li is great but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman michlle yeoh one of my favourtie actress did not even look like a japanese some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate feminine characteristics of japanese women with which i can't agree more these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much br br geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audiences but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume best director or best picture
<START> spoilers four men ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty decide to go on a rafting trip on the cahulawassee river before it is flooded br br they wanted to have fun to have a nice weekend in the nature br br but when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them bobby everything begins to go to hell in a handbasket and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life br br 'deliverance' which in italian is stupidly titled 'un tranquillo weekend di paura' 'a calm weekend of fear' is the grandad of movies like 'texas chainsaw massacre' 'the hills have eyes' 'wrong turn' 'last house on the left' and all the other 'evil nature revenge' subgenre films and one of the scariest right next to 'the hills have eyes' br br based on a book by james dickey who appears in the movie as sheriff bullard it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything when he doesn't br br and the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water or the hands holding the rifle from the one sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind br br deliverance 9 10
<START> this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that way it is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the so called green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner
<START> green eyes is a great movie in todays context of supporting our troops it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty during this period from a historical view the end of the vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from gene was very proud of this movie and he deserved the credits he received from writing green eyes i agree i do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or at all this movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on tv every year much like the wizard of oz the dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving i was a friend of gene logans and i was proud to know him rocky
<START> i found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example br br he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again br br it was like a game character or pan man through a mine land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive br br
<START> very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes she enlists the aid of a police cadet and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
