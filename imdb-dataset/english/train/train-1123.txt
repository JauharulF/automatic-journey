<START> at first glance this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states a race against time and plenty of secret service agents the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel br br but wait the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas' character pete garrison instead a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981 the ss agents are specially trained to take the bullet which is what makes them special who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot all this because of his failure in a polygraph test due to his adulterous banging of the first lady kim basinger tsk br br there are shades of clint eastwood's in the line of fire both featured aging actors and aging veteran has been heroes with a bit of a historical reference who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty while eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex kgb villains and the mole within the presidential detail with douglas on the run from the law he becomes similar to dr richard kimble of the fugitive hunting the proverbial one armed man while at the same time relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents which turned out to be quite interesting to watch despite slick processes it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents br br keifer sutherland and eva longoria top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrison's probable involvement in the assassination plot and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x files' fox mulder and dana scully but alas these two had very little to do here we know the reason why they're in the movie and that is to get their fans into the theatres also longoria's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy mama gabrielle and here has her in fairly low cut blouses sutherland actually tells her to cover up and tight pants ogle fest for fellow agents br br nonetheless it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world and the typical threats that they face daily including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world it's a decent suspense and investigative thriller with enough subplots to keep you entertained but one thing though like most ending action sequences this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through
<START> i should have listened i was warned and still i paid money for this after reading all the reviews after knowing the original is so bad it's good and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all still even then i couldn't resist exactly what happened here part one was hilarious it had so much politically incorrectness and other crazy fat entertainment and this one there just couldn't possibly be a worse sequel on god's green earth not basket case 2 hell not even troll 2 this is truly the worst sequel in history and that's really saying something considering the groundbreaking bottom of the barrel qualities of the original criminally insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad shot on video zero score zero entertainment value 1 3 consists of flashbacks of the original and on top of all that crazy fat ethel has lost a portion of her girth i mean honestly is this some kind of sick joke thank's a lot nick milliard 1 1
<START> musings pure delight from beginning to end not a laugh riot but a more subtle sophisticated humor what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors including reginald denny nestor paiva ian wolfe harry shannon and jason robards sr br br cary grant is at the building sight of his new home which is at that point being framed a young carpenter played by future tarzan lex barker asks him if he wants his lallies to be rabbeted or some such thing that only a carpenter would know grant not wanting to appear ignorant replies in the affirmative at that barker yells up to his mates ok boys he wants 'em rabbeted so yank 'em out a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards all grant can do is moan br br yes the movie is dated you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home and a place like that in connecticut of all places would probably run a few million bucks br br a classic movie that is really a treasure
<START> evidently not many people have seen this movie because no one is posting any more comments this is not a movie to be missed after all it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie eugene logan who was a co writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity or loss of it by being a technical adviser to truman capote's movie the glass house this movie is now available on dvd if anyone is interested i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies
<START> a reasonable effort is summary for this film a good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement maggie smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful a terrible portrayal it wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic the only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance target audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc however maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability br br 4

<START> an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script documentary hits all the beats plot points character arcs seductions moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood and all the fleeting fantasy realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into the system hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you're finally a player only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind siding fashion that for inexplicable reasons hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart your dreams and your pockets pitch is a must see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego bashing gantlet that is for most the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one's projects in hollywood if your teacher or guru has never been there they can't tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet to enter the biz talent is necessary but far from sufficient
<START> this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types the australian coast scenery is simply splendid to see what a place to visit to say the least and one day it may become my hideaway i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them although the plot is somewhat soft this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories
<START> i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i've seen it was ultra high tech for it's time it could repel enemy fire do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take down nearly anything in it's way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war era br br airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music
<START> this is one creepy movie creepier than anything david lynch and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work and it is brilliant br br it all starts of with trelkovski moves into a tenement block in paris he soon learns that the previous tenant a young woman committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him what results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia br br the whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor trelkovski's terror building up br br are they all out to kill him or maybe just drive him mad is there a difference find out for yourself 10 10
<START> while the 'special effects' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age the story of this girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen br br the fact that this is a true story and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult and with a jaded view of the world it may not be as enjoyable to some i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son br br this like many other movies is not for everyone if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories are partial to peru macchu picchu and or the amazon then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years
<START> there's really not a lot to say about las vegas lady it's harmless enough but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that's been done to death except in the case of las vegas lady i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year old the plan involves three women Â one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage that's pretty much it intricate huh other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable las vegas lady co stars stuart whitman when not pawing stevens his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film br br i really wanted to like this movie it does have that 70s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa 1975 but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4 10 Â and that's probably overstating it in the end las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage
<START> by 1941 columbia was a full fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or warners that's the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman top billed for the first time in an american film and warner baxter bergman plays a frenchwoman this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to baxter's four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907 until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so goody good it's a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through Â she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles Â but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later
<START> first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film that said of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant shawshank the scariest the woman in black the funniest shark attack iii megaladon and now the worst vampires vs zombies br br the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny look elsewhere it is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into that said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world this is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies br br this movie suffers from the over used saying i don't know where to start truly everything about this movie is broken from the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs zombies some of the following problems are 1 scene misfires it's clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car you are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is no exaggeration 10 second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or tv commentators dread where was the editing 2 acting a forgivable offense in most cases you can't expect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all but vampires vs zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level these actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on playstation but that acting was even better br br 3 story wait what story again you can't expect this to be the greatest story ever told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative why the vampires who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys why all the lesbians but most importantly what's the deal with the zombies if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean but to those who haven't i'll be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end br br there's so much more but i hope i've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie
<START> i saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986 i saw this on vhs in a 'for sale' bin and bought it br br in 1998 i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling families and friends that wouldn't understand us the travel the heartbreak etc henry winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively a great way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time plus look at the cast william daniels knight rider polly holiday alice and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr if you get a chance watch it
<START> in my opinion a guy thing is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom to be and his soon to be sexy cousin in law if you ask me they lit up the screen like magic you can also feel their chemistry between them before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed in conclusion to anyone who's a fan of jason lee or julia stiles i recommend this movie you're in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> i think this is a great version i came on here before to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version i do not regret picking this version and neither will you i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it there is nothing like the book and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that i would say god personally led me to this version it points to true love for a humans i would say god's love is greater if there is anything better i would like to see it but so far there is none like it
<START> i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution br br now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie br br prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the 80's so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame br br 9 10
<START> this is a b series film noir and my vote reflects its membership in that genre i saw this film last night at a left bank cinema in paris where it opened a two week film noir run the film has some flaws yes but far too many delicious elements to ignore br br as the previous reviewer remarked the drumming scene is incredible b movies could tread where a movies were forbidden to enter and the plot is intriguing regarding franchot tone however i beg to disagree to me he's suitably mysterious just the right shade of creepy one must bear in mind that there's a sort of german expressionism happening here the director robert siodmark was a german who came to hollywood during the war and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film at least it does for me br br however it's the gorgeous ella raines who in only her third credited performance held this viewer entranced throughout the film a girl friday type with a strong resemblance to gene tierney it's a wonder that she didn't become a household name but she's so good here that i've just ordered another film of hers 'impact' off the internet and i can't wait to see it as well
<START> i enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second run theatre in the early '80's i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings but to me the cast was largely squandered their personalities muffled by the masks while the direction i think of as being unusually static and the photography murky the rating jotted down at the time was a nought which means not worth sitting through even once br br still i too would jump at a chance to have a second look
