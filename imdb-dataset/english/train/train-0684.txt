<START> this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking through the jungle up a rocky cliff near a river or lake to pad out the running time the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras for a zombie cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn't see an uncut version
<START> i have not read the book that this was based upon inspired by this being some of the others are film roles the last work of john ritter rip one hopes that it is hilarious and it is almost every time he's present in this as a matter of fact most of the cast supporting as well as regular play off each other well and the material tends to be great he plays paul hennessy the father of three teenagers rory the typical guy of that age kerry the depressive middle child who fights for causes and awareness and bridget the fashion loving popular ditz sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sit com and her character is far removed from peggy bundy the show changed somewhat after mr three's company passed on and for a while they couldn't seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs or being poignant and making sure to be respectful one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that it could still be quite good some of the additions were fortunate if you like david spade most of his part consists of him doing his schtick and had stuff to say my personal favorite episode is in the last season the humor is a nice mix of dumb person jokes mainly related to the high schoolers silliness dark comedy and crude material this dealt with sex and other adult topics but never in a graphic manner the language is mild and on occasion moderately strong i recommend this to any fan of those who made it 8 10
<START> like freddy's revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br i've not alot to say about this it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series
<START> this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't care what the critics say it's bad i think the problem is with kundera's novel it's not that it's unfilmable it's just that like 99 of his work it's pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with himself his characters come off as navel gazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful i just don't understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the self absorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i don't think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential
<START> i suck at gratuitous boob references so i'm just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a i'm going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50's horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elvira's or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free br br p s another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
<START> first off i hadn't seen the blob since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be br br sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world but the blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them in fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy colored world and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him br br to sum up if you can take off your postmodern irony filter there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye
<START> citizen x is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of history's worst serial killers what makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place the soviet union in the 1980's br br mild spoilers br br viktor burakov magnificently played by stephen rea is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the rostov oblast militia he discovers past and present unsolved murders apparently by the same person the murders are unsolved because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence he is driven to find and stop the killer his only tools are his dedication skill and honesty his obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the soviet system that discourages the search for truth his naivetÃ© would have led to failure were it not for his boss col mikhail fetisov donald sutherland fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the soviet bureaucracy however he also shares burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice even if the official party line is there are no serial killers in the soviet union br br the cast is outstanding the locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day soviet life randy edelman's score is particularly good br br more important this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy this was a made for cable movie by hbo films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made
<START> i saw this movie at an actual movie theater probably the 2 00 one with my cousin and uncle we were around 11 and 12 i guess and really into scary movies i remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us pick the movie and we probably never got to do that again and sooo disappointed afterwards just boring and not scary the only redeeming thing i can remember was corky pigeon from silver spoons and that wasn't all that great just someone i recognized i've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst this was from what i can recall one of the most boring non scary waste of our collective 6 and a waste of film i have read some of the reviews that say it is worth a watch and i say too each his own but i wouldn't even bother not even so bad it's good
<START> i regret that i've seen this movie can't believe that the creator of best intentions and pelle the conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film what a waste
<START> this film reminds me a lot of the anti drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about tom hanks and his buddies are role playing but there are no dice lots of candles and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group quite funny but misguided i wonder how many poor kids had their d d stuff destroyed and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction as a film it's basically an after school special bad acting although hanks does show some of his talent and relationship talks and no one seems to be having any fun it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism which is more serious apparently and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does despite my vote of 2 this is worth watching due to its unique genre scare films which i personally find quite funny
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies 1981 is absolutely the worst movie ever made surpassing even the witless plan 9 from outer space the lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes each featuring different performers the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities br br well maybe there is one another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice and he's right misses ganzel and dusenberry flash their assets prettily in part one and part two respectively but their glamorous displays are alas wasted the directors seem to have forgotten that even t a needs a credible story to surround it and there's none in sight br br the third segment starring robby benson and richard widmark is the most disgusting of the three and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film benson plays an eager beaver young policeman brightly reporting for his first day of duty ready to rid the streets of evil he is paired with an old cynical cop played by widmark and when these oil and water partners set out on their first patrol together we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures maybe just maybe the cynical old timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty maybe all will end happily after all but alas this movie heads straight for the toilet with no redemption no happy ending no coherent story of any kind br br before national lampoon goes to the movies i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out unfortunately i hadn't seen the half of it br br
<START> being a music student myself i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch little did i know i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears this movie was implausible throughout it's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn't know a thing about classical music let me give you just a few examples 1 there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever just having a nice pop voice isn't enough besides that's a different thing altogether another genre different technique it's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class 2 how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury if she wasn't a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why weren't we told so 3 being able to read music is a necessity if you're to major in music 4 how did angela get a hold of that video tape that would have been kept confidential for the jury's eyes only now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn't have a clue i wonder which 5 the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did not yes she was able to sing the notes but carmen is a mezzo soprano while holly's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre not at all compatible with that song 6 worst of all not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesn't even try to hide it the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital where it is cut short in a disgraceful way mozart would roll over in his grave the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music it's stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric guitars and it's almost as good as britney spears i know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research anyhow i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated but without that i really can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one it's good for a laugh
<START> i laughed all the way through this rotten movie it's so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep they're lesbians nothing rings true in this lifetime for women with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn't take it doesn't help there's a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship a sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids sheesh no cliche is left unturned
<START> we went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of my favourite martian' we had our 6 year old daughter with us she wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents the parts we did see were only occasionally humorous mostly either too silly or gross i would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9 12 if that it's definitely not suited for younger children from what i've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to relive the past you'll probably be disappointed
<START> i can't say i'm all that experienced in misty mundae flicks having seen only a handful but it's obvious that this was made on a shoestring and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb raider rip off inside a garage it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing the film only runs for forty five minutes and this is definitely a good thing as there isn't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer it has something to do with an evil nazi scientist who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could a mummy which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty this film's version of tomb raider who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings this film could have been better it's got misty mundae for a start and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter darian caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot although that isn't really a bad thing obviously this is a rubbish film but the fact that it's short is to its credit and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex you could do worse
<START> i am usually disappointed by network movies even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people however this one is the worst of the worst the screenplay is weak and the acting especially that of tracey pollan is abominable i've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks when she tries to express fear anger or grief it's extremely hollow because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment scary things won't scare you sad things won't make you sad romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive first to die says a lot about this movie
<START> grey matter aka the brain machine but the video people thought better of that the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977 it's that kind of movie the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people who turn out to be roughly a philosopher a horny priest a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way my s has better production values than this it held my interest though just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing dabbling in four guys in a room character drama the answer a tract about how science is inferior to god thanks a lot it's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle the priest is played by james roscoe p coltrane best the philosopher by gerald the republican simon mcraney also featuring very very very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention
<START> i don't doubt that the critics panned this movie especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot costello or more recently don knotts it won't shake the world or change movies forever what it will do is entertain when all is said done that's the most important thing anyway watch this movie forget your troubles it even has a simple kind moral message at no extra charge i always loved elvira's tv show when i lived in la she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original theda bara this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best cassandra peterson does it best long live elvira we need more of these kind of movies there are never enough the villain william morgan sheppard was also excellent he exudes a wonderful refined malice i could find no technical faults the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets my profound compliments to the director james signorelli all his crew
<START> oh god where to begin bad acting characters you just don't care about are they american or british they seem to think they are in america because where else is this enormous forest in the midlands br br one big fault they are driving all night through these woods unless they are going around and around they'd have been in scotland come the morning when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over br br and they're mobiles don't work so what do they do split up of course make it easier to be picked off so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to 'care' for the unconscious woman so what do they do rather than make her comfortable cushion her head cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in br br and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were ejected from heaven to live amongst us so what do they do embark on sexual relations with any men they encounter no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off i think they are missing the point br br these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are cannabalistic vampires and as for tom savini saying how breath takingly beautiful they are well those gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face dept the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible sirens br br rubbish film waste of Â£2 30 from my local library
<START> overall i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers br br however i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols' closer one scene especially where adrian grenier's character is questioning rosario dawson's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owen's character is questioning julia roberts although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in love also note that anna is the name of both dawson's and roberts' character can't be coincidence now closer is based on patrick marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzler's reigen so i'm not sure how this connection formed br br anyone have an idea
