<START> having just recently re viewed lipstick for the first time in a few decades i backed it with descent even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine br br it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years from the full on gore of i spit on your grave to the tawdry sensationalism of lipstick to the tasteful handling of the issue in the accused but descent though making some important points never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning no descent is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make a message that when examined closely isn't that groundbreaking br br i pretty much knew the plot going in what i wanted to see was the descent or degeneration of dawson's character being a big fan of rosario's i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted you know the kind of portrayal deniro brings to taxi driver unfortunately the script and the director writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition br br the biggest point of failure is the second act it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club hopping drug use and obsession with big black stallion adrian every white boy's nightmare natch from a q a on the dvd but this excursion into dawson's character is never believably rendered we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time what she's after or why she's doing it the poor quality of the audio video again don't help but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well done first act by the time we get to the finale our interest has already waned br br one point of success that dawson does point out in the q a is that by the end revenge scene we are pumped for retribution then realize just how drawn out and ugly the reality is while that's certainly valid it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing br br if you have the dvd check out the deleted classroom scene this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation though all verbal and really does show dawson's slow crack up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy condescending dorm counselor if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence br br as the film stands in the final cut though all we get is what we've seen before only in a more graphic rendering so what
<START> this might be the wwe's 2nd best ppv of the year after wrestlemania it was a good suprise john cena had an excellent match in which he upset chris jericho jeff hardy retained his ic title in a short sloppy match with willam regal bubba spike dudley won a fairly violent tables match over benoit guerrero jamie noble had a really good match with kidman which was suprising to me booker t defeated the big show in a no dq match at one point booker t gave the scissors kick to big show and sent him right through the table in a stupid decision by the wwe christian and lance storm the jealous anti americans defeated hogan and edge with a lot of help from test and jericho rvd and brock had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and rvd got to retain his ic title through a dq so i was happy he kept the title triple h also signed with eric bischoff and raw which means little to nothing and in the main event the rock became the first ever 7 time wwe world champion defeating both kurt angle undertaker in a triple threat match overall this is probably the wwe's 2nd best ppv of 2002 7 10
<START> i didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon br br i'll leave it to pierre berton noted historian born and raised in dawson city yukon and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush klondike the last great gold rush 1896 1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with six guns was continued in the far country another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns Â that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is empty br br where is the constable asks brennan br br up on the pelly river trouble with the chilkats someone replies he's got a real tough job that constable he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time br br the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense they collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad in true canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called giving a risquÃ© performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights br br in such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american well i'm taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece br br in 1898 the big year of the stampede there wasn't a serious crime Â let alone a murder Â in dawson the contrast with skagway on the american side which was a lawless town run by soapy smith the denver confidence man was remarkable but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law which a soapy smith character from skagway Â he is called gannon in the picture Â can easily control in real life one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant br br in the movie the lone mountie says yes i'm the law i represent the law in the yukon territory about fifty thousand square miles of it br br then why aren't there more of you br br because yesterday this was a wilderness we didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands now that you're here we'll protect you br br when br br there'll be a post established here in dawson early in may br br what happens between now and may you going to be here to keep order br br part of the time br br what about the rest of the time br br pick yourselves a good man swear him in have him act as marshalÂ br br the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture his astonishing suggestion Â that an american town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence Â is accepted naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot and he does others get shot even walter brennan gets shot stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own he pins on the tin star and he and the bully gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax br br to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north this bald re telling of the story passes rational belief br br Âexcerpt from hollywood's canada by pierre berton 1975
<START> i can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie that's all i've got to say the movie speaks for itself
<START> this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous i wanted to watch darkness falls actually and thought that this was the movie boy what a mistake i fast forwarded as much as i could and still i couldn't get rid of the boring moments i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie they were actually given money for this crap isn't that amazing i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee please come on who gives money for such crap movies oh and the tooth fairy was lame not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make up
<START> for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide cfto tv toronto every saturday morning at 6 am i lived about a two hour drive north of toronto and we couldn't get cfto but you know how it is we always want what we can't have br br well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it would've been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i could've known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me bonkers until ctv affiliate ckco built a re transmitter in wiarton ontario and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as cfto saturday mornings at 6 am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 5 59 and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was br br talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too
<START> this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn't on any of her collections the reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending unlike all her other films its also not a musical although she does belt out one song called' the world owes me a living' the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white the version i have is in colour and on vhs i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful the film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it especially when jerry gary cooper steals a necklace and hides it in shirley's teddy bear the tension and slow build up to his actions while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room is very well directed gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good in all this is a good film from the early 30's accept it for its age
<START> i gave 1 to this film i can't understand how ettore scola one of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial boring and not interesting too long too boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
<START> there's little to get excited about dan in real life first off the whole setup is incredibly contrived did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant marie wouldn't have told dan where she was going and since dan did all the talking during that conversation why would she be so attracted to him for that matter i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie he's very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he's truly a good guy for example he lies to marie in the bookstore ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a 'blind date' there's more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family yeah like that could really happen dan in real life is slow paced sappy and manipulative even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable tearjerker
<START> this film speaks a universal language one can relate it to the self community society or the wider world it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction ownership the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction the opposing force of innovation creativity and growth the factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled the idea is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one's internal voice conscience through the looking it makes one feel as opposed to just watch
<START> knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting directing and acting and it's nice to see when a director script get it right clocking in at just 82 minutes 10 items or less doesn't stretch the story trying to grasp at inane topics it stays focused being funny sad and well thought out br br morgan freeman lucky number slevin stars as him an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him we're introduced to him as he travels to a supermarket in an out of the way section of town by the kid jonah hill click realizing he has a star in his car the kid pressures him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years him isn't very forthcoming because not only has he been out of it for while he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in i haven't decided if i'm going to accept the part the kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville stuck him decides to check out the local market he immediately runs into the beautiful scarlet paz vega who operates the 10 items or less register not just strikingly pretty but intelligent him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role he learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community br br but him doesn't just use scarlet he helps her so he can see deeper into her life they travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for and how to dress for success even when confronted with target as the epitome of local clothing this is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of him too showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain store retail world these shirts are only 12 bucks how is this possible the ending as stated at the beginning of this review is abrupt but apropos there's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond they know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other it's a quiet but riveting moment as scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside him's l a mansion br br this is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going and it won't waste your time either
<START> unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would've chosen it this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance carol burnett albert finney tim curry bernadette peters edward hermann the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston father of actress angelica huston is what made this film so charming even the 1999 remake with kathy bates victor garber alan cumming and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains she had a few bit parts in movies but i don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom ridiculous they couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks miss hannigan and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady it doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for tv it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie
<START> i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery br br dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a so called graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance br br seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 10 10
<START> this coming of age film deals with the experiences of two young girls dani and maureen as they learn about life and love one fateful summer br br directed by robert mulligan famous for his superb work in to kill a mockingbird the film never hits a false note all the acting is superb as dani reese witherspoon makes a stunning film debut watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film i felt like i was looking through a window to reality rather than watching a movie br br i have watched this movie at least 5 times and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young being in love and going through the feelings challenges and changes of young adulthood families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together and use it as a discussion piece as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry how to deal with being in love the responsibilities of a parent etc
<START> i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest br br saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasn't good br br great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films br br overall i was totally disappointed with the movie
<START> this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well written elements br br as for the littlest of the little rascals i honestly can't think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factor br br after the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and well done for the time with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i haven't seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance
<START> while watching this movie i got sick i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again it is terrible from beginning to it's end how can they manage to make it soo bad well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha but they are never close to pippi may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast burn the movie and save the kids if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh we love pippi inger nilsson sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi oh yes when read the spoilers explanation 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film well i guess the director stands for this you are looking at this movie at your own risk it is really a waste of time
<START> brothers with psychokinetic powers yes really duel not just for debra winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers br br there are surreal touches the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour wit and romance the soundtrack is great also and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid mmmmm dennis quaid setting his own trailer a rockin' too 'she's a lady' priceless br br best line missing from the quotes section btw 'once you've had a clown you never go back ' br br i love this movie i just ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with legally blond 3 don't put you off give it a try
<START> this review owes its existence entirely to a review we take a weekly tv magazine to see what is coming up and duly decide what we will watch obligingly there are brief reviews of most of the films scheduled to be shown on the five major terrestrial channels in addition to the prose each film is allocated a 1 5 star rating 5 means don't miss superior to 4 for excellent down to 1 standing for poor we have learned from vast experience that with few exceptions stars are awarded for gross taste foul language offensive content promiscuity horror blood guts and especially killing off the hero heroine just when everyone was about to live happily ever after if that isn't done the movie is denigrated as being 'predictable' the worst insult imaginable br br brave new girl was given only 1 star thereby suggesting it was a candidate worthy of our time and attention this was confirmed by the reviewer's description of the movie as being a truly awful tale and stupid just stupid we watched it and my wife and i were glad we did so the tv magazine reviewer further stated that the movie was not a reworking of war and peace with which we have to agree reading through the imdb reviews for this title a day or two later the urge to pick up my pen so to speak to add my halfpennyworth pronounced harf'pen'uth emphasis on the first syllable for the uninitiated became overwhelming br br why did we take to this movie well it's just a matter of taste we like attractive characters believable relationships between them interesting situations courtesy and respect good triumphing over evil and so on we liked the integrity and personalities of holly lindsey haun her mum virginia madsen ditz barbara mamabolo grant nick roth zoe joanne boland and the two male professors involved in the story so what if the storyline includes a 'wicked witch of the west' in the form of angela barbara mamabolo provided that she plays the part with some conviction we appreciated the friendship depicted between the two room mates with one having a financially challenged upbringing by a loving single mum and the other having every material advantage but receiving little parental time and affection is it any wonder that ditz felt the way she did about holly's mum is it surprising that grant should take an immediate interest in holly considering the manner of their initial meeting holly's dazzling smiles and her lively self possession i think these issues and the events are believable enough but it is necessary to pretend that the scholarship and other circumstances are realistic in order for the tale to have a setting br br my wife and i are greatly blessed by not having any significant musical education this enables us to enjoy the sounds produced by instruments and voices without having our critical faculties intruding unduly on our listening and thus spoiling the experience we enjoyed both the classical pieces and the pop which came over well on the tv and we weren't struck by any lack of talent also it mattered not that holly's classical vocals were dubbed by someone else br br we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd the average delivered price we have paid per disk for the movies in our collection currently stands at Â£4 9484 rounded to four decimal places brave new girl was available from a trusted supplier on the amazon marketplace for Â£1 3516 rounded to four decimal places above this figure such a purchase would increase the average why i should resent this is a mystery to me but it is a testimony to our enjoyment of this film that we placed an order anyway i have awarded this film 7 imdb stars out of ten having docked one for overenthusiastic reception of the performances by the audiences one for britney advertising and one for something else i can't remember right now in case it hasn't tumbled this review is an anthem in celebration of the use of brackets
