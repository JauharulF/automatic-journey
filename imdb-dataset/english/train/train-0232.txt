<START> i don't think any movie of van damme's will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as 1st vd returns a luc must do battle again he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them 2 goldberg was cool he does his famous move forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling sucks vd goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like always the helicopter kick even though the final ending should've been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original
<START> an absolutely brilliant show the second season began where the first ended with much mystery suspense in most if not all episodes and mystery everywhere one that made me think and think again it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time more mystery to be solved good selection of cast too for this show fit the characters perfectly really can't wait to finally discover the secret hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending
<START> a bum gives a secret serviceman a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president baloney how did the bum know the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works but who cares most of this just slows down the movie all the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies then after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out guns all his buddies we have a shootout in the toronto city hall the canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs but how did they get into this finally all is worked out but it still makes no sense
<START> what reviewers and mst3k left out is the best part and only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rape in the shower scene committed by the bad guy ben gazzara look alike on maria as mentioned killed later through t j 's ineptitude perhaps rape is too strong a word prison mating ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben gazzara introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the 30 ish blonde disses him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the courtship is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway let's just say he catches up with her in the cabana later
<START> this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy i really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv it would be well worth the time to watch it again
<START> the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made this one delivers a lot of fighting generous amounts of blood bikers fighting indians and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time the acting is beyond terrible what ever happened to robert walker jr at one point he was in some major studio productions and then he just faded away this movie really blows but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time it is a good one to watch at the end of the movie you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it
<START> i'm a huge fan of the twin sisters although this was one of their not soo good movies i'm not saying it's bad i can't say it's bad but this whole popular and not popular thingy isn't good although i give this movie a 4
<START> we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie basically dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyes which i needed after i watched this movie apparently neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter too bad the screenwriters didn't have it by the way does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine disease war i mean come on doesn't neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has finally when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing dancing and wrecking havoc basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip i mean where else could you see a t rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider man they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract why why would kids sign a blank contract screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some brain drain that he will let the children go the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb give in and agree to his terms what this is stupid they could have just menaced him made him drop the contract eaten it then walked off with the kids i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him oh yeah that's not violent at all we're back makes no sense it's not fun it's goofy it's stupid poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film even for a kid's film this is bad
<START> passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one this film for some reason hasn't received its credit due first lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure mix in a polish translator a comatose mother a crack head with turrets syndrome a twisted homosexual hypnotist and one drag queen money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister crack addict with turret's syndrome her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks
<START> i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it i failed horribly cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but johnny test is entertainment in it's lowest form the writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags aren't much gags at all kids will love it and that's about it br br now this isn't to say that it's all bad the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat it's a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for it br br some of the characters could be very interesting in theory with a little work the characters could work well together but they're too one dimensional then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow br br the pace is a bit too fast as well the episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing this is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth on the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and that's really the entirety of the target audience br br overall the show looks very good on paper but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting this is a show i want to like but i'm incapable of it there's just so much potential that isn't realized kids will enjoy it but that's about it
<START> the season finale sent mix messages i felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being lied to and deceived roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband dan had died she also admits the family never won the lottery and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be i'm still confused about when she said becky ended up with david and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be but it wasn't so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings i will always be a fan of the show
<START> a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah that's it was that worth a movie i knew it wasn't supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one
<START> i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film the only reason why i didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing br br the problem is with the rest of the picture alice faye comes off quite hollow don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material he comes off so terribly corny br br the plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye br br it seems that by playing the song and dance man ameche's marriage gets a second change to reignite some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts br br s z sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine ditto for j carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role br br this is a chica chica boom bomb of a film
<START> i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double shot automatic crossbow with sights on it not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights but beowulf beat grendel in hand to hand combat the terrible wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all sci fi original movies didn't help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead that's really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that it's a made for tv movie and skip it right there br br a travesty
<START> this film was a disaster from start to finish interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st leonard or as some old testament prophet many of the performances are forgettable over interpretations especially rufus martha wainright's or bland under achievements only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard's own versions by using a little restraint annoying little pseudo avant garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen's comments making it harder to hear what's being said and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added gravitas for the real thing see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988
<START> i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today a show that is broadcast all over the world br br unfortunately this show doesn't even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one dimensional the acting is well mediocre i'm being nice it's the classic cbc recipe one that always fails br br if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem most of the better comedies are rooted in that it's only a problem when it isn't funny as in this show br br canada is bursting with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any
<START> my family goes back to new orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand parents never talked about but we knew it existed i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can pass as white and chose not to it's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence and at the same time had i not come out of that history i probably wouldn't be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor but it is a movie that needed to be made anne rice is incredible and i ask myself why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and i'm not i recommend this movie to everyone leza
<START> this is one really bad movie i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious i've seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen diamonds secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record br br from everything i've read the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin
<START> maria braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband hermann an explosion ripped through the building to begin with and she and hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of rubble on the street perhaps this may strike some as a heavy handed metaphor for what's about to come marriage on the rocks so to speak it's a betrothal where the husband goes off to war and is held in a russian prison camp unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria who keeps standing by the depressing rubble of the train station as some come home others don't with a sign awaiting hermann br br trouble arises as happens in rainer werner fassbinder's melodramas and as its one of his best and most provocative we see as maria uncommonly gorgeous hanna schygulla in this role will do a two face she'll stand by her man even if it means working at a bar for american gi's and even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black gi and comes close to bearing his child that is naturally until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe or working for a german businessman effectively sympathetic ivan desny and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company maria will do whatever it takes to be successful but she'll always be married br br it's hard to say there's anything about maria that isn't fascinating money sex power all of these become interchangeable for maria she's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile she gets to have a husband more or less actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film while obtaining things a man who dotes on her whenever he can a new and expensive house with servants a secretary money that others around her aren't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere such as the secretary played interestingly enough by fassbinder's own mother br br maria is sexy confident and all alone with an idealized life going against a life that should be made in the shade she says of the two men the american soldier and poor old and sick oswald that she's fond of them and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soul searching husband hermann sends from canada after being released from prison she's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce but understand where she's coming from and going all the way br br fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama for example hermann walking in on the jubilant and half naked maria and gi is just about a masterpiece of a scene with maria's reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he's there let alone alive while sticking to his guns as a director of such high minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable but it isn't really it's like one big metaphor for a country that after the war couldn't really move on to normalcy a few times fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background and we see maria walking around her family house hustle and bustle going on around her and the radio speaks of a divided germany of things still very unsettled of a disarray maybe the only way to cope is excess or maybe that's just my interpretation of it br br it's hard to tell really under schygulla's stare face and eyes anyway it's such an incredible performance really one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old time hollywood female star while with the down and dirty ethic of a girl of the streets most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband where she stars in one of those super lustful black lingerie pieces and high heels and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it that's almost the essence of what maria is and schygulla wonderfully gets it down a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her sometimes in a single sentence this is what fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his trilogy while i might overall prefer veronika voss as a masterpiece maria braun is perhaps just as good as a character study of what makes a woman tick and tock with almost nothing to lose
<START> man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasn't any good as i wasn't really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the film's opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady 1975 Â but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody's guessÂ br br even so since i paid 1 50 for its rental and i was in a monster movie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws like pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts cum boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself Â a plesiosaur i e half dinosaur half fish Â is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw 1957 which i've also just seen this didn't seem to bother the film makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movie's second half
