<START> gurinda chada's semi autobiographical film 2002 is a gentle poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near heahthrow airport in west london br br like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess bhamra parminder nagra and jules paxton keira knightley as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with david beckham br br much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds br br somewhere in the middle as broker peacemaker and blighted athlete joe jonathan reece myers team coach for the hounslow harriers intercedes in times of crisis while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters br br eventually and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams br br with great performances from bollywood veteran anupam kher mr bhamra shaheen khan mrs bhamra juliet stevenson mrs paxton and frank harper mr paxton this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers br br pinky bamrha archie panjabi and taz trey farley are struggling their own struggles but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film br br in it's own special way this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football it celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old
<START> this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeare's most vibrant plays i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before by doing this though by making every line clear and every intent obvious they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature somehow it is actually boring a very hard feat given such wonderful material br br the acting is forgettable at best sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro others however do not fare so well april shawnham's hero is a pouty breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces jerry mayer's don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash though snidley was much more enjoyable br br f murray abraham you know the guy who killed mozart is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits br br given that the producer joseph papp is basically a theater god this production is not only disappointing but head scratching as well br br don't bother with this watch branagh's much ado instead his version is overflowing with vitality and humor to say nothing of wonderful performances
<START> this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school br br this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins br br the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over exaggerate on many things they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job though br br the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes br br overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie 7 10
<START> although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism it is in fact nothing of the sort it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post columbian odyssey as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest br br in contrast to like water for chocolate erendira expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain proud aloof sorrowful and above all else weighed down with history br br the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history i e the present is always obscure since we are too close to it for honest evaluation refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director given the ambitions of the film br br erendira is gorgeous a big screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening but if not vhs is better than never seeing it at all
<START> the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2 br br the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made all of you must watch this perfection 10 10 br br
<START> i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child porn which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically i would liken this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half it's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product from the start character development and story development are lacking unfortunately many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think ahh ok finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on or who this character is or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more or understand and get involved more with this inter character relationship etc but no such luck on the contrary many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled only to find that whatever mini plot within whatever mini plot and that poorly presented was just a ruse why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2 1 2 stars another mystery it's not that the characters aren't likable to some degree or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half
<START> i liked batman dead end a dark edgy film noir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is not br br first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark bartram as batman but that isn't saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a body builder who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting it's not it's quite the opposite it's called posing something real actors avoid like the plague br br something i never understood why collora casted body builders as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired br br the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a full length film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny cloying and amateur michael o'hearn superman is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines that's about it although i'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to collora cast actors not bodybuilders actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book br br the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop br br superman flies in this movie but that isn't a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera br br the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of two face and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what i'm talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer br br finally i ask why if you're trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for collora here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing br br batman dead end didn't feel amateur i can't figure out where this went wrong
<START> i remember watching this in the 1970s then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library br br with a nearly 30 year hiatus i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series some at the center of power like traudl junge hitler's secretary karl doenitz head of germany's navy anthony eden uk are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on from generals and admirals to sergeants russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here br br i can remember the lord mountbatten interview killed in the 1970s br br this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work well deserved br br seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set br br this is the only 10 i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
<START> this story is a familiar one in the long running tom and jerry cartoons especially in the 1940s the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse jerry tom has an unnamed buddy butch living in the house with him so this really upsets mammy two shoes who can't believe that they have a mouse despite two cats in the house br br anyway the one who catches jerry can stay while the other gets the boot so the competition is on br br even though it's familiar territory i still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining you not only had the cats competing against each but jerry in the equation as well so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a tom jerry fan
<START> yesterday i went to the monthly antique flea market that comes to town i really have no interest in such things but i went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest looking over the hundreds of vendor passing many of them quickly i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant irene dunne co starrer my favorite wife but the vhs tapes by their nature were mostly older films i couldn't resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for 10 00 what a bargain as eddie murphy used to say i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen john cassavettes's opening night 1977 well i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances he also had faces 1968 i had seen this about 20 years ago a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain so i grabbed that one too my other choice was claire's knee 1970 br br when i got home i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night i was totally enthralled by this film it focuses on myrtle gordon gena rowlands a famous actress of stage and screen who during out of town previews is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play's theme of facing aging after one rehearsal an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries and tears of i love you i love you a few minutes later this fan is hit by a car and killed this begins myrtle's descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging the future of her career as a mature actress and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself written by a much older female dramatist played by joan blondell throughout the film she sees the dead girl an obvious symbol of her past drinks almost constantly and receives insincere support from her director ben gazzara the producer paul stewart her costar john cassavettes himself and the dramatist actually they're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers flubbing lines on stage improvising new lines generally cracking up on stage and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk br br this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote cassavettes's displeasure with mainstream movie making as i watched the film i was at times surprised confused amused disparaging but ultimately involved entertained and satisfied cassavettes really had a great sense of humor cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story he makes allusions to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by anne baxter at the beginning of that film this allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme the contrast of the older and younger woman he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for myrtle's confronting her own lost youth at first i felt the symbolism was too obvious but then i realized that that was cassavettes's intention he doesn't want his audience misunderstanding what he's getting at if they did it would interfere with their emotional involvement this spectre of youth haunts myrtle attacks her and wants to destroy her myrtle eventually kills her but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play she must reach bottom another figurative death so cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway she resurrects herself helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film's theme and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she's playing these scenes are funny and interesting cassavettes and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie the play they're doing also acts as contrast it's mainstream and self serious about the issues it addresses that is until myrtle changes its denouement in doing so she also improves the work of her co stars the natural evolution of interaction achieved through improvisation between and among human beings subjective realism and universal truth these were cassavettes's concerns in making films br br gena rowlands is amazing throughout of course she has that great face and cassavettes notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what's going on inside of her she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention but anyone with interest in good film making and great acting will be rewarded someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies all others be forewarned br br seek out opening night if you've never seen it everyone in it is excellent and it's one of cassavettes's best films
<START> thre isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious calm and intelligent br br it's 3 dvd sides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet methodical no frills put the focus on the content approach that is taken here and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal idiosyncratic and specific reasons not just more me too votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved speaker on the topic i really appreciate his articulate generous interviews over the last decade br br on a negative note scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well established about film history and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose it's very distracting
<START> back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didn't just listen to william randolph hearst she'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith br br what you're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardom br br if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines br br she does get her first big break but it doesn't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it one of the most despised people in cinema br br show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony that in itself makes show people a film worth saving br br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ain't we got fun i'm sitting on top of the world you'd be surprised california here i come as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced a song called crossroads was introduced in it it's not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack i guess since they're not seen it was felt no billing was necessary still i'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people br br it's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience
<START> this was just a terrible movie it hurt me to watch it almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie the acting was really poor p diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally predictable some links to carlito's way were okay for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien but on the whole they were weak the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable anyways i really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren't met i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor friday night lights he's lucky though because i'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars better luck next time and yes i did enjoy carlito's way
<START> i enjoyed this movie haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile br br i wasn't troubled that dotty's anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook there are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms she is clearly a sensitive with extra sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric br br although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle it's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
<START> i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i don't remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben stiller's jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isn't a movie for you i'm just giving you another person's opinion
<START> ok it's very rare that i complain something i got for free so i guess this movie pushed me over that limit i saw it at the hollywood cemetery for free and walked away very very disappointed one audience member's question to the director about using the native american references just as bookends instead of being weaved into the movie better basically says everything that this movie failed on br br native american references the native american references felt really out of place and contrived it's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before they should have stuck to the old adage of write about something you know if they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice br br clichÃ©s and on the nose i agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie so i held it to higher expectations little miss sunshine was an indie and saw it before it became so popular before it even came out to wide release i was already raving how it's going to be a hit unfortunately i could not say the same about expiration date sunshine took us to clichÃ© incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a cliche this movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already trapped from the start the psycho mom's antics the hendrix couple etc br br i hate to say it but the best and worst movie i've seen this year were both indies little miss sunshine being the best and this movie being the worst i wish i could say otherwise br br but i do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery
<START> in all the comments praising or damning dalton's performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8
<START> easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me now that i'm all growed up however i see this movie for what it really is a work of genius everyone or at least everyone with any taste has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people even if they won't admit it i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen so naturally for a horror junkie such as myself thismovie was a dream come true some people say that this movie is silly or otherwise void of any intelligence it's a movie about a serial killer snowman what the hell did you expect anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one liners and cheap gore i love this movie for what it is a comedy and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman which seems impossible unfortunately i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart
<START> this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century pre wwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichÃ©d depictions of the british are rather passÃ© now br br apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative br br the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in br br all in all rather uninspiring oh and linus roache just cannot do tragedy going cross eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me
<START> this cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work there will be very very minor spoilers br br this short has a story that's incredibly slight gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs that's pretty much the plot such as it is but this cartoon isn't about the plot it's about the color and animation the visuals are exceptional back in 1936 such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here br br my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes at more than one point there are a series of pipes aligned in a row from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ br br the visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed these types of shorts were things which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than harman and ising were br br this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing it's available on the dvd attack of the '30s characters recommended particularly if you like good animation
