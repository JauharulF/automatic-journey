<START> okay i'll confess this is the movie that made me love what michael keaton could do he does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of james cagney with charm to spare br br the supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this '80s comedy a spoof of the '30s '40s gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material well yeah some of it has been copied since but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has not been copied elsewhere watch joe piscopo warn people to not do with one of the great taglines of spoofs watch roman moronie do things with english profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh watch amazing sight gags such as pet store owner johnny kelly using the price tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church latin done while a guy who never took shop class assembles a thompson machine gun from parts watch lines you'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade watch maureen stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard working mom with surprise gags that you'll never see coming br br if you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone be patient another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are you'll need to pause until you're done rolling on the floor several times duckies and bunnies them too watch for the subtle stuff some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings br br there are a few minor flaws but it's probably the best of the spoofs some come close but none of them are quite this good
<START> i always found betsy drake rather creepy and this movie reinforces that as another review said this is a stalker movie that isn't very funny i watched it because it has cg in it but he hardly gets any screen time it's no north by northwest
<START> well you might not actually see any women in love in this movie but you'll certainly hear women talking about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plants br br welcome to the world of d h lawrence where psycho babble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are spending time with the characters in a d h lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party when i read women in love i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it but since i couldn't i was hoping they would at least strangle each other alas only one of them dies not by strangulation and i won't spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people br br to give director ken russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel he throws out much of the psychological mumbo jumbo that lawrence adored and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields two buck naked men wrestling by firelight and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates yup buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass i'm not kidding glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun the more dominant of the two sisters at the story's focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russell's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified looking cattle oliver reed has one expression an intense glower the whole thing is over written and over directed and it's deliriously campy indeed this vies with mommie dearest as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i've ever seen br br grade d
<START> if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi you'll be disappointed however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme you've found you're movie br br this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs fiction articles from a purely technical point of view though the film was alright the sets costumes and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit br br i wonder how the director co writer agnÃ¨s merlet defended her film at the time perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim which would've been unfortunate because lets face it she was
<START> with rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum and montage superimposition of images and vague interwoven narratives this is a very hard movie to follow apparently a man masue inoue takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife and maybe to rescue her but she's clearly mad huddled on the floor with a vacant expression much of the time and fear misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time the film maker switches to her point of view sometimes and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby or clutching at a drowned child she's tormented by something when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things showing us what mad people see and then how they react and the place is swarming with mad folks laughing hiding and in one case dancing frenetically night and day at one point the man tries to take his wife outside but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away and he kills the doctor and many attendants and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud when he wakes he is relieved and mops the floor some fascinating shots of japanes life streets buildings in the 1920s
<START> a lot of people unfairly sh t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic especially for the video's vintage and low budget br br let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know this film is an extreme torture fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid 80s it's plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is this entails brutal violence all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound br br the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings br br the actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes br br if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot 8 5 10 for devil's experiment
<START> i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh
<START> a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake centipede scorpion lizard toad while the last student was taught a little in each style all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money and soon everyone is battling to get the money br br classic martial arts film has title that even many non fans know i've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head its a very good movie though i'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example this isn't to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is we're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i've ever seen where there are no women i don't think one has a speaking role and i'm pretty sure that none appear in the background its indicative of nothing its just something that struck me this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch br br around 7 out of 10
<START> because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a spout of b tchiness i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played katherine whose name i purposefully don't include i'm pretending she doesn't exist remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless though i will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst i've seen don't watch it just don't there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first
<START> for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina gershon well others have said it but i'll reiterate why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i don't know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two br br and the girl modine was in love with suddenly she's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly i couldn't care less about any of these people
<START> worse than the rating it has been given this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end this movie is terrible in the beginning scenes this movie has moses which was charlton heston in the demille film pharoah yul brynner and nefretiri anne baxtor overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality
<START> remember ralph bakshi the guy that was an animator on terrytoons then on paramount cartoon studios after that he was a director on fritz the cat 1 2 and heavy traffic well this is coonskin and it's actually pretty good racist but good the movie takes place in harlem nights no duh it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie song of the south br br it's about sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys i used to know just like you and your friends pappy's story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage br br brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear voice of white and preacher fox voice of gordone decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel arriving in harlem rabbit bear and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be they encounter a con man named simple savior a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the cousin of black jesus and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites in a flashy stage performance in his church savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionÂrepresented by images of john wayne elvis presley and richard nixon before asking his parishioners for donations br br rabbit first goes up against madigan a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they're not worth it when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs he and his cohorts ruby and bobby are led to a nightclub called the cottontail br br a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink madigan while under the influence of his spiked drink is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype adorned in something racist and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead br br then while recovering from his delirium of being drugged shoots his gun around randomly and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them br br rabbit bear fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up the live action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops but managing to make it out alive br br this movie was controversial at that time of release and was re edited by the director several times under the title street fight which is obvious since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary br br that caused bryanston pictures the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic texas chainsaw massacre to go out of business because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film but due to racism bryanston took over bakshi's production br br despite the controversy it was worth the entertainment the animation was awesome at that time the plot makes sense and it's actually funny too br br final verdict 9 10
<START> i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it i wondered if it was an independent film and i was correct but with a good cast i decided to chance it basically drifter michael williams nicolas cage is in the town red rock wyoming looking for a job and meeting bar owner wayne brown pleasantville's j t walsh he is given a large sum of money mistaken for a hit man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne lara flynn boyle he does not correct him takes the money and goes to warn suzanne and after she makes him a counteroffer he decides he needs to leave when wayne knows his real identity he chases michael shooting a big gun until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas dennis hopper but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit man he was mistaken for and he makes a quick retreat he goes back to suzanne and knowing they are both in danger they plan to leave town together and add another complication by falling for each other before they leave however suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe of course things aren't going to go smoothly and wayne and lyle catch up to them and lyle forces them and now tied up wayne to go and get the buried money in the end lyle and wayne both get what they deserve michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together but it is obvious she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves too also starring craig reay as jim vance johnson as mr johnson timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard the performances apart from maybe a lame boyle are all fine and dandy and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller very good

<START> two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part it's a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we can't sympathize with our hero how he is called by the story teller because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault i'm sorry i can't understand him not enough the writer director actor want us admitting to him that it's not his destroyed self consciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we won't follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didn't notice yet it's a quite depressing film br br in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesn t follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too passive not to mention tisserand's complex he has an inhibition but he couldn't be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world it's not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but don't follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within
<START> i'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie and it was a who's who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didn't care because the headliners were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t shirt this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day there's nothing reasonable nor taste determined nor really anything except their fandom snotty of me isn't it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale music br br desmond howl had it all it's hard to say what he's lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in and trite as it sounds breaks him out br br canadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often full frontal makes something artistic i'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what i'm talking about it's almost like a don't do this handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago br br in the 90s and 00s however some films such as bruce mcdonald's work and the brilliant c r a z y have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadian isms it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that redeems even the rheostatics
<START> i do agree with everything calamine has said and i don't always agree with people but what calamine has said is very true it is time for the girls to move on to better roles i would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and i would like to see them grow as people actresses and in their career as well as their personal life so producers please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets this movie that is being commented is not too bad but as i have seen further on in their movies their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography when in rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence i think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds maybe some that are like the sixth sense the hour chocolat that sort of movie not saying to have just serious movies for them humour ones too yes but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and new york minute note i am from australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z
<START> i saw it last night on tv and was quite delighted br br it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realistic br br i loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque english coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their tea br br perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didn't stop me from really really enjoying the whole story
<START> when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb's views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 7 0 or above on the site i did not enjoy br br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever br br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch black characters br br ethan hawke's hank is a 30 something whining immature irresponsible man child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser which he very much is his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film it's more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there br br speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non existent self esteem with insults seriously that's just about all the character does her harpy like behavior borders on malevolent br br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open half grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation for someone who's been an actor as long as mr finney you think he'd be more apt at emoting even though he doesn't show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger filled and when he smothers andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery br br marisa tomei isn't given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason when andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self serving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at least br br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 his performance of the heroin addicted embezzling financial executive who's perfect crime of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his mother br br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh's great performance and it's family train wreck nature just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really aren't
