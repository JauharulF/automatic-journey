<START> what can i say it's a damn good movie see it if you still haven't great camera works and lighting techniques awesome just awesome orson welles is incredible 'the lady from shanghai' can certainly take the place of 'citizen kane'
<START> gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film the last 15 minutes or thereabouts are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film it's not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions but the only real reason if i were to be honest to see it is peck for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament
<START> this is the second part of 'the animatrix' a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix' br br in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together it is a little history lesson in the world of 'the matrix' not as good as the first part 'the final flight of the osiris' but still pretty entertaining
<START> i've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be toby malone's performance really stood out i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters quite an achievement considering it's short running time there are plenty of good twists throughout as well it will keep you guessing until the end other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off you could do a lot worse than checking this out you won't regret it good fun 7 10
<START> this piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the native american indians played by white men the right wing republican james stewart was a huge racist in real life just like his close friend john wayne in 1971 stewart had actor hal williams fired from the jimmy stewart show a short lived series that mercifully flopped just because williams was black as if that were not bad enough this film is very dated and boring watch dances with wolves instead for a less racist view br br stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16 year old debra paget i'm surprised it was even allowed br br 0 10
<START> i know i should like this film and i do for the most part but as other's have mentioned it is a bit long in the tooth i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well i also have to say that overall the movie leaves me cold it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film on the plus side the effects are great besides the cartoon monster as are the effects props costumes and of course robbie if the robot was not in this film i don't think it would have been as popular as it was is the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the krell as many times as i've seen this movie the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were based on what was being produced at that time besides this island earth forbidden planet is miles above the average sci fi movies of the time being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment certainly a classic in its own right flaws and all and deservedly so
<START> intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip off i do not make this observation lightly Â i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1 600 films 93 on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise aimee jaguar it's in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right Â we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay and nelly stereotypes to boot the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at 9 95 this film would have been way overpriced i understand that it's soon to be re priced under 20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of 29 95 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews Â i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director writer actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it
<START> i wouldn't be surprised if soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre revolution cuba as graphically corrupt as it was merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd still part one which is almost entirely shot in the jungle does capture the feel of that place especially when traversing the mountainous areas of cuba i liked del toro's interpretation of che guevara's personality and the actor who plays castro bichir also did a great job against all odds it's clear soderbergh doesn't look down on these people but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past some of the more important historical aspects contradict what i've read to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted but on other aspects he is right on especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control the country's treasury was left empty
<START> being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre and therefore having seen a large number of these films it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique for that matter it is equally rare that i am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes the love story is a little thin on the ground but i'd say that's probably for the best as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on comedy and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than i like most rom com's to do the four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film but in any film i've seen in a long while i hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a 10 over a 9 as a rating as i believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact i'm also a big meg ryan fan which helps but this is one of the few films i've seen in which i'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed she and tim robbins are cast as the leads but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals a genuine laugh out loud type film
<START> russell my fav is gorgeous in this film but more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity fabulous love story between lachlin and lil i replay their scenes over and over again anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people all characters are cast and portrayed excellently
<START> i really hope that concorde new horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror or even action movie when they made carnosaur 3 the movie is flat out silly from start to finish even the humor in c3 is funny because it's bad definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad it's good' genre if you enjoy the very worst of the worst this is for you
<START> when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked keira knightley mickey rourke christopher walken and tony scott on other occasions i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories yes the editing and cinematography were frantic the story was weak and the acting was mediocre but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason domino was very very entertaining and often very funny it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much even though i loved it and recommend it
<START> i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains br br this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love family and friendship br br it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 br br this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family br br i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life
<START> a shaky hand held camera was used presumably to give the film a documentary look but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion sickness just from watching it it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera no offense meant to cp sufferers but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer the camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture i checked back a while later it was showing on tv and it hadn't gotten any better i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten
<START> the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference you are missing a real treat doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making makeup set designs no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did he was and is tarzan
<START> i was on france around march 05 and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this cinÃ©mas d'amÃ©rique latine de toulouse but i've never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van 4 br br the film is stunning it doesn't caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was french subtitled but it's still shocking br br this film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a stunning mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kinda connection with cero y van 4 a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances cero y van 4 is a film that you won't forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned
<START> i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group n w a which dates back to the beginning in 1988 in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 the band breaking up when dr dre left which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and dr dre in 1991 this story was somewhat based on that br br further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious not to mention the love song tasty was hooking up and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're managers getting shot every time too br br people who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots my opinion
<START> city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country state or any sort of major political table granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena especially nowadays but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising malice and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out what else or rather who else al pacino the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up br br i absolutely hate talking about al pacino i mean even if once he didn't give a good performance how could i ever say it the man is acting royalty there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i've ever seen at the 'james bone' funeral i re watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino john cusack who i really do enjoy as an actor turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance he seems like he's trying too hard his accent is just bizarre and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off maybe he was having an off film bridget fonda on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan her performance is very similar to cusack's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter stern br br the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors everyone is okay there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics if you just won't see this movie than find pacino's speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it if you're a john cusack fan which i am he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss 7 5 10
<START> i was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses this paramount has a Âmighty wurlitzer' organ Â also magnificently restored that was used to accompany the silent films of the day br br we were fortunate enough to have dennis james a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once in a lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen br br this was greta garbo's first american film she was only 20 years old but already had 6 swedish films in her repertoire br br it is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the mise en scene it was necessary to leave much to the imagination br br modern audiences for the most part do not understand silent filmsÂ acting was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times Â the acting is seen as Âhammy' and over done Â but it was simply the style of the period br br garbo with all her subtlety did much to usher in the new age of acting she could say more with a half closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug she exemplifies the truism that a picture is worth a thousand words ' br br even though this is garbo's first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands this was mgm filmmaking at its best the sets and costumes were magnificent the special effects Â which by today's standards are pretty feeble Â were still electrifying and amazing br br the script by vicente blasco ibanez from the novel by entre naranjos would seem to be tailor made for garbo it showcases her strengths magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part br br her co star was mgm's answer to rudolph valentino ricardo cortez he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film allow himself to look unnactractive appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully br br there are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted Â especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo notable among them are lucien littlefield as Âcupido' and martha mattox as ÂdoÃ±a bernarda brull ' br br this is when the extraordinary cinematographer william h daniels met garbo Â they went on to make 20 films together he was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known the divine garbo without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was br br seeing this film is an all too rare opportunity if you ever have the chance do not miss it
