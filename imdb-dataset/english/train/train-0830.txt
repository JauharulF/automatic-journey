<START> wow i don't even really remember that much about this movie except that it stunk br br the plot's basically a girl's parents neglect her so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad am i the only one disturbed by that then this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ash's mom to pretend to be the girl's i don't care if he was trying to make the girl happy that's just gross br br there was no real plot the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way she played with unowns was the daughter of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her dad br br that's pretty much all i can remember but i think you can take it as a hint and not see it or if you do see it don't expect much 1 out of 10 br br seriously if you want a pokemon movie rent pokemon the first movie
<START> i hate this programme not only is the very concept ludicrous but it tries so hard to be feasible something that was left out of similar i confess ending programmes like muder she wrote br br sigh why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court br br come on after x amount of years of the cases being unsolved why must every suspect every episode confess damn it to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved br br i bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen aw shucks officer you're a bright one i guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court what can i say it's a fair cop br br absolute dog s t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i q
<START> hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard aaron scates cory monteith is involved in an accident which leaves him blind luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist dr andrea hewitt justine bateman who works for olaris has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another hewitt decides aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment hewitt her team transplant the eyes of a wolf into aaron he miraculously regains his sight brilliant right well no not really since aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of wolves starts to develop a lust for blood aaron escapes the olaris building goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go a full scale search is mounted to capture him br br directed by yelena lanskaya this is yet another sci fi channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way i think it probably started out life as a straight 'creature feature' but ended up as one of the most boring dull sci fi channel films i have seen that doesn't even feature any sort of monster or creature hybrid is awful the script is terrible i am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to the initial set up is ok with aaron getting wolf eyes but then hybrid ditches the sci fi elements becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on aaron's mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some native american woman yep you don't think the sci fi channel could make a film about wolves put loads of rubbish about native american mythology in there as well do you the dynamics of the character's is bizarre aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film is a fairly unlikable ungrateful annoying person while dr hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives aaron back his sight does nothing but try to help him i mean aaron is given back the gift of sight yet hewitt is the villain also the regular sci fi channel staple of us military intervention is present the problem is why do they want aaron so badly he isn't a soldier while he has wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he's utterly unremarkable the script can't make it's mind up whether it's all in aaron's mind or it's real the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked rememeber this was made for telly aaron running through a forest with a pack of wolves set to some horrible music that i think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny there are so many things wrong with hybrid it's slower than hell there's virtually no action there's no werewolves the film goes round in circles trying to get into aaron's mind yet it's all so ridiculous silly boring you won't care one bit there's never any explanation as to why despite just having wolves eyes transplanted aaron starts to develop other wolf senses br br as a diabetic i have problems with my eyes hell i have had major surgery on my right eye i can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up you wouldn't be able to open it it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness there are no special effects no blood or gore or violence nothing to excite you in fact now i think about it there's nothing even remotely horror or sci fi feeling about this it feels like a drab film of the week br br filmed in manitoba in canada the film looks ok but is bland forgettable the acting is poor from all involved none of whom i have seen before hopefully never again br br hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some werewolve 'creature feature' but is far from that most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches
<START> i think i truly love this film prix de beaute was originally a silent film but later dubbed into french in 1930 despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers this remains a stunning tour de force for louis brooks the fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary edith piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception br br this is the story of lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend andre georges charlia and their friend antonin augusto bandini lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome andre when lulu considers applying for the title of 'miss europe' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of easy street br br the film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women we see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them but at the center of it all is the magnificent louise brooks br br if you don't mind watching films from the bygone eras then consider checking out this one louise brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you'll want to know more also check her out in 'pandora's box' if you can find it br br be wary of the us kino dvd release i don't know if their projection speed is correct a lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed this may have been the way they were shot i don't know but since it's the only way to see this film it's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill
<START> hey people what's up it's me man the one and only mike sonny sakura killer kelly you know you can't really write a review on the script of sakura cause there we didn't have one as far as i know the story was just made up as we went along i had the best time of my life making that film and got so much stank that i ran out of jism fun times so glad that you all enjoyed the film i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned every time i set up some moves the fight director kept changing them still i had a blast and met some really great people especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film making scene
<START> an our gang comedy short br br the gang coerces spanky into watching their younger siblings caring for these forgotten babies turns out to be quite a chore leaving the little nipper with no choice but to come up with some ingenious solutions to the baby sitting problem br br spanky is in his glory in this hilarious little film arguably his best highlight spanky's retelling the plot of the tarzan movie he's recently seen to the audience of infants movie mavens will recognize billy gilbert's voice in the radio drama
<START> bad movie for sure it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of hasty scenes the airport one for example and a real unfunny time charles dance is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in last action hero eddie murphy is doing a non comic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success i'll never understand why or how in one tv interview i've heard eddie murphy himself when he was nominated for an oscar 2007 regretted it in a comic way br br one of the comments said hey it's the 1980s well no my friend it's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s br br there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie the first is that i'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of charlotte lewis especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be but how odd as i've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again anyhow the second reason is that i've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever br br the bottom line bad movie greeeeeat legs
<START> one of disney's best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain
<START> or an audience a quick recap br br so you've got this doctor who's been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason he wants to perfect transplants but feels he needs to do this in his basement wtf and then suddenly unfortunately and conveniently his fiancÃ© gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that he's responsible for agonized with grief he preserves her head in a lasagna pan or is it strudel and pumps it full of adreno serum sic to keep it alive and then she awakes talking her head off so to speak even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords and she has no lungs so she couldn't speak even if she had 'em seems the ungrateful b tch doesn't appreciate all that her fiancÃ© has done for her just like a woman br br then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved's head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street meanwhile the doctor's assistant a sort of dime store igor gets into philosophical arguments with the head who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the monster in the closet every mad scientist has one eventually the screenwriter realizes that he can't keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum so he kills everybody then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie's financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it br br have i mentioned that i think this is a bad movie br br someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious
<START> hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138 i remember seeing fragments of this movie almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation so when i found a copy in a well known store for Â£9 i couldn't resist but buy it the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it memory is funny that way br br viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean 'moebius' giraud some of the artwork is i can only assume some influence here br br when pazu catches a falling girl sheeta his adventure really begins the quest for laputa a reference to jonathan swift's overlooked portion of gulliver's travels with healthy references to jules verne it's a basic good vs bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa br br this is the portion that is strongest in my memory the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree this is in my opinion the highlight of the movie the views of the surface of laputa as opposed to the mechanised underground br br although this is the dichotomy of this movie to show that even technology cannot overcome nature the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same br br it is incredibly stylish i would not say 'slick' very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings airships and the design and look of just about everything br br myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime buy this movie and treasure it
<START> ugly shot poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dante's 1981 classic the howling is one of the two or three only good werewolf films ever made and yet it got 'rewarded' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one if it's any consolation stirba is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dante's film the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves Â primarily female ones Â led by stirba stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super babe with impressive bosom in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused her arch enemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee his character Â stefan crosscoe Â is an occult investigator who travels to stirba's kingdom accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult in case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity this is your film even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence however if you want a little substance or depth you'll be sorely disappointed the dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the transsylvanian setting garlic wooden stakes and danning's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film's only gimmick during the end credits a shot in which she rips off her top is re edited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer dr gore no less than seventeen times which is pretty pathetic and pointless the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful i'm talking about the fierce looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirba's castle the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and Â as far as i'm concerned Â his only worthwhile film remains the beast within released three years earlier
<START> when hey arnold first came on the air in 1996 i watched it it was one of my favorite shows then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so i got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it i was sort of surprised when i heard about hey arnold the movie since it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other nickelodeon cartoons like spongebob squarepants nevertheless having nothing better to do i went to see the movie anyway going into the theater i wasn't expecting much i was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens' cartoon like the recess movie was i guess i got what i expected it was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more there were some good parts here and there but for the most part the movie was a stinker simply for kids
<START> the brain machine will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off none of them will be missed br br the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous good call there on the senator's part there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the project' too bad he wasn't more effective he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey br br if nothing else the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title time warp nothing else would make any sense as for myself i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr krisner's experiment titled 'group stress project' it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike br br keep an eye out just above the general's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds br br you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard gerald mcraney fan could he have ever been that young james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend but don't call him father for something a little more up his alley try to get your hands on 1959's the killer shrews that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously
<START> what happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function how alone can one man get when the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much what happens frownland explores these questions definitely a startling original debut from bronstein the tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence we follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day most of us have known people like this people that say sorry too much or i appreciate it when there's nothing to appreciate so we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them well because its interesting and bronstein and the lead actor dore mann do an excellent job this film is about as un commercial as a film can get a few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money it was shot on 16mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget with no distributer this may be a tough one to find i think it's been screening randomly for the past year or so hopefully it'll be on dvd at some point i saw it at the silent movie theater here in la there were 10 people in the audience among them crispin glover if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is highly recommended
<START> holly is an issue driven film but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental at its heart is it is a character driven film which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed out portrayals of patrick ron livingston the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience and holly thuy nguyen the strong willed but ultimately over matched young vietnamese girl from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing everything is forthright and well done the contemporary classical score may put some off at first but it is top notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout this film which raises many issues but provides few clear cut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight kudos to those who managed to get it made
<START> the tooth fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives the first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day the worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting they could have done without the hammond brothers and a few other scenes but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect the eye candy is pretty good for both genders camera work is good dialog is fair but cheesy i expected the film to be a bare bones low budget slasher with very few redeeming factors i was surprised by the quality of the film
<START> there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming in brail the competition worm farming had a better plot and more interesting characters i was physically ill after watching this movie the cheating husband i think dougray scott was a joke in every meaning of the word poor jennifer must really need the work and what was with the accent the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named this is not a laxitive thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious
<START> the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor it has a deeper plot better character development and the tunes especially the closing song are both catchy and warm hearted sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on it is a care bears movie this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship love and again caring not to mention the care bears are just too adorable
<START> please note that i haven't seen the film since i discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and doesn't carry it however i really want to say something about it i'm actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film i think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr bucke and walt whitman please don't waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry
<START> basically a dentist husband wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity the premise is interesting the acting is good and the music although sometimes abrupt and without direction is pretty cool br br the problem is the plot the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show she has a minor role and then walks back in to give her something but sees her with another man the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego denis leary a former patient of his and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to do something about it i won't tell you the ending but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper the motivations of the characters are missing why is she cheating on him he's a dentist decent looking good father the film doesn't say who's she doing it with don't expect any answers on that either why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this who knows what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve where is this film going good performances by campbell scott and hope davis and denis leary as comic relief are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film a root canal is more interesting avoid it
