<START> obnoxious eva longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel without wings falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her she is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex boyfriend with his new girlfriend a psychic who can see her br br obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichÃ©d sort of way except that longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper to be fair longoria nor anyone else in the cast or crew isn't the problem its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings its just really really stupid
<START> before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was it had it's great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
<START> this story is beautifully acted it is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash and ever since she has been labeled the 'miracle baby' she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough her findings along the way affect those closest around her her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine 3 dimensional and believable set around a peach canning factory in small town australia this is a warm gentle erotic film and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close after reading some of the other rather shallow comments about hugo weaving i would like to add that i think he was brilliantly cast and was extremely sexy no he is not brad pitt but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive
<START> i have to admit right off the top i'm not a big fan of family films these days most of them imho are sentimental crap but this one like toy story the previous film from pixar is a lot of fun the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland especially compared to the two leads in antz but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it the animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently good i especially liked hopper's line if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you i would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all terrific denis leary doing an animated movie what a concept and like everyone else i loved the outtakes i hope the video has the new ones
<START> it gets really bad the only half way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film there are context errors everywhere the acting is horrible save kirk the story is as holey as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie if it wasn't already a corpse so all in all it's a waste of your life i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale
<START> 'home alone 3' is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains however the plot is very similar to the original 'home alone' film instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them this film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remote control car the slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film no pun intended this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had it's more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me i would not recommend this film it's pretty boring if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original 'home alone' movie
<START> note to self just because a film is foreign obscure and stars catherine zeta jones doesn't mean it's any good such is the case with 'blue juice ' a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem to a dumb american anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers cornwall england you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing quirky little comedy if only the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of '90's british version of 'grease' without the dancing but even that makes it sound better than it is no the best way to take it is as a little slice of life set in a small town catherine zeta jones plays chloe a young woman living with a surfing instructor jc sean pertwee you remember him pertwee is actually the film's star and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this in this case it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer and a fat nerdy guy who in a needlessly extended scene gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him i can't honestly say everything that goes on in 'blue juice' is predictable since it's set in a place and reflects customs and manners i'm not very familiar with but there's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters the comedy though is very predictable and tired one can sense the set ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue in american form of course before the actors do the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed she wants him to grow up he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being he's afraid of losing face with his gang she thinks he prefers them to her you get the idea as i struggled to stay focused on 'blue juice ' toward the end i felt as the saying goes that this was an hour and half of my life i'd never get back
<START> okay i'll admit it i am a goof ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy while i have seen more films by kurosawa bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail uhf start the revolution without me strange brew and the bill and ted movies they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them br br while bill ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film it still is great fun also unlike the original it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs but every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments particularly those involving the grim reaper and by the way this reaper is about as different from bergman's in the seventh seal as you can get in addition to a lot of laughs this film features some excellent music one way that it's actually better than the first film the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes provided you aren't an old killjoy like de nomolos great viewing for kids and adults alike
<START> this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isn't any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public i e there's no forced romance br br i liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this one br br warning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
<START> this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes brainiac great whites and other species of shark bull black tip oceanic white tip tiger have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found humans don't often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior it's not like it's never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knock off laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below a shark the size of bruce if you don't know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca hey that's the name of the blatant rip off we're discussing as it would weigh upwards of 6 000 lbs i could go on but i don't need to jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing orca is crap blatant rip off of jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick it doesn't take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies
<START> it's interesting that all who so far seemed to like this film had no expectations i guess that's the trick in contrast with them i had optimistic expectations and that was a mistake as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director that's always a clear sign of them they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors the actors in this film though had only one facial expression each br br if the close camera wasn't enough the lack of light in the film killed it the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur as well ooh ooh we're going to light the set with a flashlight that will make it all seem intimate no that made it all seem invisible br br on top of the serious technical flaws there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany but in los angeles forget about it br br the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it in fact two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's total darkness technique but when the film shuddered on instead there were moans coming from the audience and once the movie finally did end it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity folding sheets cutting vegetables spreading honey on bread yeah we get it the life of the lonely old man was boring but we figured that one out at the very beginning br br i recommend that audiences miss this one it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie goers
<START> for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clichÃ©d ending i've seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word
<START> this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not the storyline is the traditional all clichÃ©es are included br br the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half descent actors are trying to make it sound real the photo is not too good the music is so malplacÃ©e it actually made me angry the actors are not even trying altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the action itself br br i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming who is financing this shit where is the screening and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script br br there are a million hollywood movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison br br i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life
<START> i think that that creator s of this film's concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received it isn't an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 in the theatre br br i don't think this is and hope it isn't a spoiler but imagine acting on your impulses doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldn't actually say or do if anything this film only scratches the surface it doesn't go as far as it could go br br in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older classics to try and cash in on today wouldn't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didn't wouldn't or couldn't deal with 20 years ago br br that's just my opinion anyway o
<START> the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
<START> the first time i saw this film i loved it it was different br br i am a christian bible believing i don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers i dropped out of that atmosphere br br to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do i call it the judas syndrome br br judas didn't get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world br br this film certainly showed some of that br br i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples br br also he was a very gorgeous jesus br br it's a watch over and over movie br br very satisfying
<START> i pity people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood comeon guys this movie is a thriller without thrill br br come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs br br technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie br br kamal at his best is the best in tollywood
<START> as usual on imdb going by the majority vote instead of the weighted average is far more indicative of the movie's entertainment value in this case the majority gives it a one how right they are to start my review i'll first admit that i am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled alien intruder it does involve space and even an alien i suppose but there's no rhyme or reason at all for anything in the long run at least no actual plot basis or resolution that i can make out anywhere br br there are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious with regard to both the lines the timing and how they are spoken that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies i have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic bugs bunny seems to be ranting about something br br the plot solely involves an area of space known as the g spot sorry make that g sector and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien virus i think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal ariel appears as a photographic negative br br for most of the movie we see people getting shot with space weapons falling out of lofts and seemingly endless pointless close shots of where's ariel can't find ariel pointless because most of the other shots include interaction with ariel anyway whatever on a computer monitor commander skyler billy dee sits and watches each fantasy of the convict's vr programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it or maybe i missed something br br billy dee williams took a few courses on how to act in despair prior to the filming of this we know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful br br the docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi hilarious at least and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle looking much like a lego experiment gone awry br br it seems everyone dies in this movie so why bother even the vr females get killed as if that is supposed to mean anything especially since everyone else dies anyway outrageous br br because of the money i save on groceries i won't rant about wanting my money back that i paid for the dvd of this the dollar that i saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer's time br br i'll just add that the story itself at least as a novel and with far more detail added could probably be quite interesting with the right author br br 1 10
<START> without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling unoriginal elements 'party of five' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there's little rooting interest because the singular non homicidal element is a second rate bland awful acting 'wes bentley' mopester in fact all of the acting is skin deep even though the dark haired women appeal the salaciousness is kept to a minimum no nudity here also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood all sensations are kept at a teasing safe distance an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher ' only the soundtrack the droning angsty alt country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low angles that adds to the malaise but for a film that calls itself horror i did not even get close to flinching once perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest
