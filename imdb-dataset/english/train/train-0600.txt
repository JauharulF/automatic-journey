<START> i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one liners minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly however this film is not one of those cases br br take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement the acting is poor bland and pedestrian and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end the scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled i would call this anticlimatic but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever not even in the erotic scenes it would be untrue i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin basically this film offers nothing to interest or amaze no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours a tragically boring and dreary film
<START> you ever sit through a movie and after it's all over it's like one big wtf br br welcome to decoy br br another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all peter weller and robert patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries for hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows robert patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus co stars the ambient charlotte lewis and canada's own scott hylands of tv's night heat fame
<START> this movie had potential but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse's acting i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is bad br br her delivery is robotic when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head so her voice has very little inflection i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie she has to know somebody in the biz br br now i hate to be this mean about her but the comment has to be this long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else br br however i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie but the end was disappointing as well maybe if her acting had been better i would have liked it
<START> spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film so not really spoiler after all saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it it's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply she is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor but that's another story which i don't remember too good the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked can't be compared with the witch in 'snowwhite' who in comparison is easy to find out very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing
<START> i have never seen such a movie before i was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie i never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching i give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash i mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like the camera is in front of them you will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh although he doesn't speak english lol if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this this movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie defines lame the evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time the evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want the transition between scenes leaves you wondering did i miss something so many plot holes from scene to scene i was laughing like crazy when they decided to escape to mexico to get away from the serpent hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from korea interesting very interesting i guess hopping the border solves all problems another scene that completely stupified me they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other the scene was so clichÃ©d and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they just met even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light bad hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this in the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment every scene in your head
<START> this is an absolute great show jessica alba besides being the most beautiful women in the world is a great actress she does a great job of portraying max and i could never see anyone else doing that role she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous
<START> mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits br br the special effects look like they are from the '70's the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awful br br the only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids br br there are far better shows for your kids to watch br br try giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers
<START> the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria 1837 to 1901 after having seen in recent years the efforts with keira knightley's the duchess cate blanchett's elizabeth films and scarlett johansson and natalie portman's take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl more contemporary stories would include helen mirren's award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess diana's death br br each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ok so some may dispute johansson or were the flavour of their moment and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films however the young victoria as the title already suggests is a lite version of the young queen's life and if you're looking for that definitive event or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady self serving politicians unfortunately there's nothing of depth here br br that's not to say the young victoria is without directed by canadian jean marc vallee best known for crazy and written by julian fellowes this film chronicles in very plain terms the life and times of victoria emily blunt soon becoming the new it girl when she was a child the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent miranda richardson and her adviser sir john conroy mark strong to appoint themselves as joint regent to her throne as already planned for by reigning king william jim broadbent as if that wasn't enough the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne paul bettany being a prime minister in waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace on one hand you'd understand the need for a young and new queen to have trusted people in key positions but on the other are they really acting in her interests or in the interests of others br br even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert rupert friend where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film and pretty much everything already included in the trailers for both they've been brought up under the influence of others and told each step of the way exactly what to do even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding and to do so with the help of each other instead of being pawns there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling and at times absurd rules and regulations trust also becomes a much valued commodity and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean br br however all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative from childhood to romance marriage and children in fact there's so much fast forwarding here especially the last few minutes filled with inter titles that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more and room of course for another movie which i suspect would probably not see the light of day but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response and come out with a mini series or such it's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character defining adversary br br with its star studded cast one would expect more but one would be left wanting more instead recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned
<START> i actually went to see this film in a theater but what a complete waste of time and money bad acting i'm sorry to say did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay br br some friends told me to go and see this film since james redfield the author of the book was very heavily involved in the screenplay they had really enjoyed the book so the movie just had to be perfect well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high but i absolutely hated this movie it was predictable too sweetish to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade
<START> i have to say when pushing daisies came out i was immediately won out by the fairy tale like setting of such grimness the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as well ned lee pace baking pies and that bringing them back to life was just as routine br br the trio of ned emerson cod chi mcbride and charlotte chuck charles anna friel plus sometimes sidekick olive snook kristin chenoweth who made the musical wicked such a delight made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness it definitely deserves the title of a romantic comedy drama br br ned and chuck made for a shy and not quite ready for love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they cannot touch an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves cellophane and quirky schedules around the apartment but despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the beehives the presence of olive though makes for some break out in song moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple br br second season sharply declined putting a damper on a show that had real potential on some of the episodes the plot line was rushed and awkward making you ask what just happened in both the overall dead person of the week plot and in the overriding plot line the addition of chuck's father plus two half brothers for ned didn't help and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled didn't the episode comfort food feel like the episode bitter sweets in the fact that the dead person of the week died in food a few touching moments the beehives happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned but every time they got close the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop oliver comes back from the monastery chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back you get the picture br br shame it didn't work out but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way just enough pleasantvillesque color happy smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it's not dead like me then again it's in pushing daisies time according to creator bryan fuller so it makes it plausible again br br it should have lasted longer but it's merely wistful thinking at this point kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short lived gem
<START> i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies these are the kind of movies that the sci fi channel shows the kind of movie that nobody ever wants and only that idiots rent when they bring it back i ask them was it any good they say no we turned it off after 15 minutes movies with terrible computer generated super imposed monsters and such like very unappealing br br this is the same type of movie that grendel is and absolute waste of time if you want a reasonably and only reasonably good beowulf based movie then try beowulf grendel starring gerard butler who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300 as king leonidas of sparta br br plus later this year we have another beowulf movie with a star studded cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan gleeson to angelina jolie and john malkovich br br but don't let that get your hopes up like we all did with eragon or we are all in for another big disappointment br br and regarding rentals here is my rule of thumb if there is only one or two copies don't rent it because its a load of crap this is true 99 9 of the time usually not true if the title is foreign or a documentary
<START> lynne ramsey makes arresting images and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered pretentious lark br br ramsey can't bring callar to life her attempts are too arty and oblique repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton's obliterated gaze alone could supply character we are in a blank warholian hell of self indulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist but how will it do so if she rarely speaks without the novel's interior monologue the celluloid morvern callar is nobody small wonder ramsey has morton undress often br br that said the first ten minutes were so impressively acted shot and edited that my hopes were soaring give the film that much it knows how to make promises if not how to keep any
<START> if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both you'll probably have to look elsewhere lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichÃ©s at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess br br beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame innocuous and anti septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing and once the zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone br br unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural ethnic dichotomy in western multi ethnic societies lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight
<START> after having watched guinea pig two questions come in mind besides 'am i really a psychopath to watch that ' 'is it a snuff ' the answer is no although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie i've ever seen and then 'where the hell have they found that girl ' because she gets tortured for '45 min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots and many more until the final scene i'm still not sure how they did that because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money so what were her their motivations br br i saw it in japonese without subtitles but it's not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes i haven't seen yet all the serial but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one still i've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen the actor but i think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones br br another movie i'm hiding from my parents br br 8 10
<START> i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre however it was lame and i didn't find myself laughing very much watch it on hbo maybe or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time but i don't recommend paying to see it br br the plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better jason lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat just don't go see this one the directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn't that important i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny see something else don't waste your time here
<START> since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso br br but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro goldwyn mayer had mario lanza under contract no one else could have done it i doubt whether it will ever be tried again br br and why should it i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen for his tenor voice was his life his reason for being on the earth br br to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest caruso like the man who portrayed him was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film br br his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought he's shown in a recording studio once late in his life actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became br br when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men it's why both became the legends that they are br br what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design br br mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with ann blyth dorothy kirsten and jarmila novotna also br br though blyth sang it in the film lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso br br if you're looking for a life of enrico caruso this ain't it if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career than you should not miss the great caruso
<START> spoilers spoilers this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla film starts out with maria schygulla and hermann braun klaus lowitsch just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive maria decides to get a job as a dancer prostitute in a club that caters to american gi's and she meets a black army soldier named bill greg eagles and they start to see one another on a steady basis maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door he hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bill's head and he dies hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald ivan desny who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karl's mistress she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up br br spoiler alert br br one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it br br there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants she's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive schygulla wasn't nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad this is only speculation and if you think i'm wrong please e mail me i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident remember her putting on a dress for no reason then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing thats the reason for the bathroom scene so when the house explodes its by accident but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate in his view maria can't have it both ways a fascinating film
<START> as you may know the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes 9 seconds and one frame we have here samira makhmalbaf iran what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing well nothing a great lesson claude lelouch france a weak plot with a great cinematography just imagine a deaf woman living by the wtc who sees without understanding it that her dog barks well just see it youssef chahine egypt the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion for everyone for an us soldier who died ten years ago for the people in the wtc but also for a palestinian suicide terrorist maybe the less tender movie towards the us danis tanovic bosnia hrzgovia good images makes us travel for sure not a very good plot idrissa oudraogo burkina faso from one of the poorest country in the world a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture osama bin laden and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is ken loach uk september 11 1973 the chile entered in a twenty years long bloody dictature thousands of death tortures all that was offered to chile by henry kissinger and the cia and knowing this changes very much your point of view i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the wtc was built alejandro gonzalez inarritu mexico impressing images that we all know too well and a lot of black screens i didn't get this one very much it is more an artist video to show in an exhibition than a movie amos gitaÃ¯ israÃ«l an absurd ballet of policemen journalists etc around a burning car in jerusalem very well done mira nair india about the anti islamic feeling that followed september the 11th very good actualy sean penn us a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten the wtc did have a huge shadow and some places now have a daylight they never had shohei imamura japan a different one here there is not even one word about the wtc and the action takes place at the end of wwii it has only one message no war is holy this short movie gives very deep feelings but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes so a great movie a great attempt to take the world's temperature i love it
<START> you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first second or third viewing but you ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium br br disney continues to firmly hold the title of greatest animation in the world with a bug s life standing as one of their greatest achievements one of the innovative attachments being the delightful out takes added to the end of the film the dvd has two sets of these out takes where as i m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape the dvd also features gerry s game which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters br br this is by far the superior insect film in comparison to dreamworks antz which in all fairness is pretty good but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters if you look at the star voices of both films antz is largely cast with big name movie stars with a few familiar tv star voices where a bug s life is just the opposite loaded with tv stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious br br dreamworks can t be blamed or surprised though when you go head to head with disney you have your work cut out for you this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with don t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids though
<START> those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow 1 priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed 2 akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by rabified dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a frown please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'
