<START> okay my title is kinda lame and almost sells this flick short i remember watching siskel ebert in '94 talking about this movie and then playing a clip or two not being a rap conscious guy although i could identify snoop dogg vanilla ice and mc hammer music i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film but then s e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts and then another scene where the band and their rival band both visit a school to promote getting involved and of course nwh comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee so i filed it away that i should see this movie br br a couple of years later this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it only to laugh my butt off for hours yes it has a spinal tap kind of rhythm to it even the documentarist takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips and the band follows a similar path what i now call the behind the music phenomenon smalltime band has good chemistry gets famous too much money too fast squabbling drugs some type of death band breaks up then reconciles finishing with a hope for more albums in the future and fade to black the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past but tap drags at some points and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes oh this is his rant about the backstage food this is spot where he wants the amp to go to eleven this is the spot where the guy makes the pint sized stonehenge etc br br contrasting to foabh which seems to have more unexpected humor you can see some of it coming but there isn't a big setup for every joke sometimes the jokes just kinda flow cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked also the direct references to vanilla ice hammer and a bunch of other caricature type rappers really worked well this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes and the songs is my peanuts better than big bottom from spinal tap i don't know but they're both damn funny tone def's awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre yet so funny br br i could go on awhile but save your time and don't waste it on cb4 i watched the first half hour and got bored you don't get bored on foabh there are slightly less funny moments but you can never tell when something good is about to happen perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste name ripoffs if i've ever heard any discover they've been sharing the same girl at one point you've got those two pointing guns at each other and the next thing you know the manager the photographer the girl and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other switching targets back and forth and of course someone does get shot br br i did find it odd that nwh's managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap's drummers although none spontaneously combusted i don't think there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw spinal tap prior to writing this film although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip hop while some similarities exist the humor is different and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing even the guy who played lamar from revenge of the nerds all in all this movie has in my opinion street cred kinda like nwh
<START> a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in it lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
<START> this movie is like the thousand cat and mouse movies that preceded it the following may look like a spoiler but it really just describes a large class of movies there is the passionate wise main character his goofy but well meaning sidekick with his ill placed attempts at humorous comments the initially hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable unlikely love story the loved ones taken hostage and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions everybody has seen tons of these movies already and national treasure is like any one of them with only a slightly modified wrapping every turn of the story was easily predicted and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie and if you have ever felt that way too heed my warning stay miles away from this movie
<START> i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isn't ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit
<START> imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68 doesn't really matter except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure abstraction isn't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
<START> anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions br br 1 the angry eyes look he gives every enemy 2 the holding of the hands to face mouth agape and frightened eyes 3 the smiling tommy turnbull br br i have to say that i pretty much hate this show i don't watch it but it's like code lyoko we've all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointless br br every episode ends with robotboy winning except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack br br the jokes are pretty crude too i think it's mostly people saying the word suck or farting i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too br br isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to not to mention his older brother who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities br br the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters like you could say the trio of coop jamie and kiva as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot br br there is simply no appeal to this show i'm surprised that it's still running
<START> while essentially a remake of the original chinese ghost story this third installment has higher production values and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story tony leung is particularly good cgs iii is a gorgeous moving film
<START> private practice is being spun off the fairly successful and well written grey's anatomy the cast is fabulous the premise might even work but the writing is just terrible br br the pre pilot disguised as a grey's anatomy episode should have been my first warning the plot was just blah i thought maybe it was a fluke so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes br br as i was watching the pilot i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more there's supposed to be excitement flash great writing intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season amazingly this show had none of that br br thinking it was a fluke i just watched the second episode hoping for the best and although marginally better it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv br br i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch not worth the effort imo and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season pass this one up folks
<START> did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what br br sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12 year old wanna be made the film br br most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well br br the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that's not the case br br turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money good thing i didn't rent the movie myself
<START> i couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they behaved br br more absurdly unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as pigface who of course has grown into a drop dead gorgeous 20 year harvard educated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the world not for the money and she beds steve carrel on the first date that's when i quit watching br br if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental self indulgent waste of time
<START> put quite simply this film is terrifying br br it starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film br br don't expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in candyman bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed br br each time you watch this film you realise more about what's happening and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect br br drawings have never been scarier
<START> mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story everyone probably has one and this is writer director yasmin ahmad's story of hers with a boy called mukhsin we know that her movies have been semi autobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though i must add as a personal bias that sepet still has a special place in my heart br br our favourite family is back pak atan mak inom orked and kak yam though this time we go back to when orked is age 10 the characters are all younger from the movies we've journeyed with them from rabun to gubra and here sharifah amani's sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles the only constant it seems is kak yam played by adibah noor and even pak atan has hair on his head through mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that yasmin has introduced us to we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when they're still living in their kampung revisited back in rabun where orked attends a chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra well she had it in her since young the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masak masak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches br br the arrival of a boy called mukhsin mohd syafie naswip to the village provides a cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites and as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions br br mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood in short those scenes screamed fun we observe the life in a typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy there are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from mukhsin's own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to orked's own br br as always yasmin's movies are filled with excellent music and for mukhsin it has something special the song hujan as penned by her father as well as ne me quitte pas aptly used in the movie given that the yasmin's movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked br br and speaking of whys parts of mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of yasmin's style or deliberately left as such i thought that as a story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure and subtly i felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two br br another highly recommended movie and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages bring along your kid brother or sister
<START> terrible acting lame plot stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk it was excruciating to sit through just awful do not waste one penny on this the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch this horror film was not even in the least bit scary creepy or disturbing it was in no way visually appealing the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor actress opening their mouth plus the entire story i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story again do not waste your time or money even if it's a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie you will feel dumber for watching it
<START> while it's early to say how the series will evolve i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be there is still potential for the series however of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential too but was sorely disappointed my gut tells me enterprise won't be as bad as voyager however br br as for the impressions of the pilot br br the pilot had some good ideas and good themes i liked the introduction the show's opening credits were interesting with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain br br where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure the plot of the episode itself was more a generic trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise tos or tng the central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series br br the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the action instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration they could have been the story get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it oh for a tv show that once again would make us think make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay there was way too much gunplay br br we had the feeling more that humans were the freshmen in an established school new kids on the block as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe sadly the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological just how do two such different societies interact don't just hint about it show it br br i had to think of it more as trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to the first brave steps into the unknown' i wanted to see something newer and fresher the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven't seen this new great concept br br i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential there are some interesting characters bakula is wonderful blalock has potential the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11 if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme we will have a show which will create new legends br br you shoot an arrow into the air good luck capt archer br br to the producers take more risks and make us think
<START> i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into killers for their country and put into the war and the after effects once they return home it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets br br this film is powerful moving emotional and thought provoking it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends br br the best film of the festival so far
<START> this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all the sound track along with finely shot hand held camera work was exquisite the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent as for mr washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light
<START> the movie shocked me personally i had herd mostly bad buzz well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes the best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship there were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate they date something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie but this movie did not follow that mold we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also it's no my fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film i'll simply say i like it
<START> i have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10 10 from the kids and me
<START> this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end it has a very humane story and very good selected music the acting of moritz bleibtreu giancarlo amato and barnaby metschurat gigi amato is satisfying recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie
<START> in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichÃ©s obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promised br br however after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one 'toilet humour' gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilarious br br the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tall br br sure you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
