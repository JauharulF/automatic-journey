<START> a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing it is clear that the writer director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc all the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes they do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school ridiculous specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken loach etc
<START> olivier gruner stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it's laughable bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey
<START> well i finally saw it i didn't go when it first came out because well frankly i was afraid afraid of how bad it might be or how disappointing while not as bad as menace and better than clones it wasn't particularly memorable or satisfying br br i was 11 years old when i saw star wars i still remember sitting in the theater from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i'll never forget a timeless story of the bored farm boy who just knows he was meant for more saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard the rogue pirate and the various comic relief all in a space opera setting br br and that's not to chastise lucas for using an old formula it's an old formula precisely because it works and to his credit he gave it new twists that made it very special br br then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time the great villain vader was luke's father wow no one saw that coming of course i'm convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay go back and watch star wars again knowing what you know now particularly in light of the first three episodes see if it really meshes br br which brings me to the problem i have revenge is an entertaining movie tremendous effects plenty of action some good fighting scenes but a movie still lives or dies on its plot the story it is telling oh certainly really good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot coupled with bad acting that's a burden no director can overcome certainly not one as bad as i'm forced to realize george lucas is the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors liam neeson natalie portman samuel jackson br br spoilers ahead the plot oh my understand he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden one too much for him to overcome br br first we have the sheer absurdities of the background we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine the product of a virginal miracle birth the chosen one well this detail never gets remotely explained indeed the closest explanation is yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong oh well okay then our mistake br br now this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c3po hey what a coincidence that is and he'll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there wow how about that testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there eh george anyway we have this bratty kid moody petulant whining young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history the great tragedy of darth vador the good guy who falls from grace only to finally achieve redemption in the end br br how pray tell does this happen why he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth now sure he lives in a star spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a physician cause maybe just maybe this futuristic society might can do something about this problem why no the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality br br well of course he does br br sheesh br br how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it how can anyone expect us to care hell why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil but because he was pathetically stupid br br oh by the way amidala finally dies in childbirth why well they don't know the doctor who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced offers only the conclusion of she's lost the will to live well oh okay of course she has maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with br br but here we are we have kenobi present for all this he knows of the birth of luke and leia knows who their father is and knows what happens to them knows also the role of both r2 and c3po and yet in several years as luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3po and r2 curiously 3po's mind is wiped but not r2's why stating i think these droids belong to you kenobi who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the emperor himself and who just happened to be built on this very planet says strange i don't recall owning any droids br br oh good grief br br lucas simply made this up as he went along once he introduced vader as luke's father sadly the story began spinning out of control because he didn't know what the story was the plot of episodes 1 3 is simply incomprehensible nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars br br it's an afterthought and it looks it br br i can't give this movie a high rating it reminds me of triple x a fun film to watch but entirely forgettable star wars will stand in my mind forever thankfully this one and the two preceding it will soon fade
<START> possible mild spoiler br br as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s it starts with a murder and it s left for the audience to muse is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client type film which ends in a ridiculous manner and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect br br this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men
<START> king's solomon's mines brings us patrick swayze playing allan quatermain who has spent a lot of time in africa but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit in comes alison deedy playing elizabeth whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth's father had sent her elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father br br there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies russians who want the map also br br the movie holds your attention until the end patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion loss and despair the rugged silent good man anger and strength in king solomon's minds his character actually smiles a few times i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live loving story again one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong maybe a little dancing would help but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it
<START> extreme makeover home edition is yet another 'feel goody' so called 'heart warming' and out for ratings show that abc has had the time to put together br br i understand the troubles that these families go through for that i am sorry but wouldn't you think that putting four wide screen plasma televisions three flat screen desktop computers an inground pool taking up half of a backyard and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a bit too excessive for any family sure these families have been through a lot sure they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had br br but honestly the things that ty pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood br br another thing that really irks me about this show is how ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or the family's condition telling a wheelchair bound person that he or she is 'so strong' or 'very brave' really does get old after a while that may sound rude but believe me watch this show and you'll see what i mean br br all in all this show is overrated if you want to watch it go ahead this comment is just a heads up for what you'd be watching
<START> in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything that's ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasher flick that has hardly any gore what so ever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it's not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over it br br 0 out of 10
<START> now it would be some sort of clichÃ© if i began with the bit about the title so i'll wait on that first this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles then i realized it this is a movie with a message that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen things like what you ask things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical kill the monster indirectly fashion now as promised blue monkey has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind now it snot like i was cheated or anything the picture on the cover had a giant bug crab idiot thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses that kinda happened but i wanted apes having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before half drunk on cask and creame's brandy mind you i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80's style not so much if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids rent this
<START> first saw this half a lifetime ago on a black and white tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i don't find it hilarious i don't find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and light hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed it br br it's 1945 and fred macmurray is a 4f who's dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he's managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washington's soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy red coating german speaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine water's rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumann's best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are 241 to 1 against you but vee are not afraid br br i can't go on too long with these fantasies but they're all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera don't you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i don't care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbusland br br anyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girl br br i've made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow awesome
<START> well easily my favourite tv series ever call me a walking mail clichÃ© but include violence mafia sex gambling drugs etc on a show and you're already winning points on in my book combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind and a few brains a long the way and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with br br above all stand two actors james gandolfini as tony soprano and edie falco as his wife carmela as for gandolfini he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now br br i can go on and on and on about every character in the show the psychological brilliance the gripping scenes etc but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more
<START> i had high hopes for this movie the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies br br i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies but this movie is bad it's completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers the linguistic games were hideous and over the top nothing about the film seemed real to me the ending was way too deus ex machina for me br br i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life
<START> three flash backs introduce the main characters abu jaffar and the princess who will interact with ahmad three are the songs each linked to those same characters three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'time' in his declaration of love to the princess answering her three questions at their first of three meetings so strong is the impression he causes that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her by three successive ploys deceit hypnosis and memory erasing yet jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman the whip the power and the sword three is the number of flying entities the mechanical horse the genie and the the genie and the magic carpet the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges and three are his considerations about human frailty before he departs abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn armed guards giant spider and giant octopus three are the instruments of justice the magical eye that shows abu the future the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess and the bow and arrow to execute jaffar there's magic in the number three and there is magic in this movie
<START> when i saw commercials for this i was thinking no what has nick at nite done because it was taking up fresh prince slots well i still love the fresh prince but george lopez is a surprisingly good show i love how not stereotypical benny is carmen is a pretty good character its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes i feel bad for the guy who plays max he looks much younger then he actually is but max is a fun character and acted well and yeah angie is a little stereotypical but she has her funny moments ha ha george does have a big head nah but he can be really good too funny show it definitely should be on more often then home improvement
<START> i revisited grand canyon earlier this year when i set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990's i first saw the film when i was 17 years old how did i hear about it it was reviewed and recommended highly by siskel ebert in 1991 and i eventually caught it on video a year later br br it's a great film a powerful film a healing film about the power of listening truly listening to one another i've seen it six times now and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing but why the poor reviews for this movie maltin's movie guide gives it two out of four too melodramatic too much coincidence too sappy are the expressions that i read the most yes there is melodrama in this story and yes there is a lot of coincidence too but it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple for all of the plot that exists in grand canyon such as drive by shootings a police chase an earthquake a love affair a woman's discovery of a baby in the bushes another shooting a near accident by a new driver and worldly advice from a homeless man this movie wins because of the smart performances by kevin kline steve martin mary mcdonnell alfre woodard danny glover and jeremy sisto it also succeeds because of lawrence kasdan's skillful direction and writing you know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves kevin kline being harassed by four black youths danny glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the kline character but not before he gets harassed too by the leader of the bunch listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to glover are you afraid of me because of me or because i have a gun br br grand canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another steve martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind i think his character is a warning that the good can carry us forward that idealism is a virtue but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon br br i fear that grand canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non new releases at the video store but with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents i plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it grand canyon is something special if you loved magnolia another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes you'll love grand canyon too
<START> i read so many comments that i too shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn't know the name of the movie thankfully because of doing a search and finding the title on this site i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later because of this site and your comments you helped me and so i want to thank all of you i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney's call it courage which contained 2 movies the second one being the legend of the boy and the eagle it touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now i own my own copy of it i think it is only available on vhs i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there enjoy it i know i did br br it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of when it was time to sacrifice the eagle the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle the eagle too saved the boy's life and more than that taught him how to survive the closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable what a wonderful era this was i have never seen anything come even close to this movie
<START> this movie is really genuine and random it's really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in hollywood i really enjoy watching this movie i bought its dvd tuesday this week and i've watched it for 4 times i love the spanglish accent of paz it s just really cute as she is and her acting and morgan's are so funny and natural br br my movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie the simple is the best br br i've learned something more about life from this movie well or at least usa's life life is really random sometimes u meet someone they pass by your life and be your friends coincidently and u don't spend so much time with them maybe just a while but u enjoy that ''while'' with them and then u and them will never meet each other again but the time u are together is really unforgettable just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories br br this movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap i rarely can learn anything from movies but this is an exception
<START> i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london sci fi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it br br i found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind br br there's nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
<START> i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther having a baby sister you know how it is by now i memorized both the plot and the lines after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see the second one was significantly weaker then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1 2 i was like ok there we go again after watching the 1 1 2 i was like wow all my expectations for repetitevness were broken a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100 br br i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon
<START> andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling out with 2 long time best girldfriends br br seeing a gigolo gold digger in the sincere young man the girl friends dead set on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game br br a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head these things just don't happen without giving away cliff hanger details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isn't worth your time
<START> for everyone who expects a traditional superhero movie it might be an unpleasant surprise it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow br br that's because sasha like each superhero takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it sasha becomes an outlaw while on the run he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him br br as you can see the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma everything happens very slowly however when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on it's all over but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions which are mostly very drastic the score is very scarce which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it br br is the film worth it that is a question really difficult to answer i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again mostly due to the atmosphere which is really dense but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope after all they're young people who have all their lives to live so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together
