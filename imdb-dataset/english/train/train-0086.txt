<START> while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series upon re watching the series i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated but the plot the gundam design character design and character depth are masterfully executed while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters consequently it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character personally i liked heero because of his stoic personality while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general how can we obtain peace while providing action packed battles in large robot suits which to say the least is excellent
<START> i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldn't wait to see it what a waste of energy it's kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynch's later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work it's tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70's it's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is forgettable no really i can't remember this one at all the amputee is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd
<START> once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended you'll find that it's not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable it's also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff this movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such 7 10
<START> roman polanski plays trelkovsky who rents an apartment in france the previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt he goes to see her there where he also meets stella isabelle adjani the friend of simone he and stella become pretty close later simone dies trelkovsky begins to think the landlord and the neighbors are trying to change him into simone so that eventually he would also jump out of the window le locataire the tenant from 1976 is the last film of polanski's apartment trilogy the previous ones were repulsion and rosemary's baby roman polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb isabelle adjani with her big glasses is wonderful the landlord monsieur zy is played by the great melvyn douglas jo van fleet plays madame dioz the fantastic shelley winters is the concierge the tenant is something very scary from time to time it gives a lot of that psychological scare this film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating
<START> the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and it's fun and if you don't like it you don't get it and if you don't get it doesn't matter it's up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun it's only a joke and that's good enough for me gabriel byrne is priceless byrne and paul anka doing my way is as vic puts it the best version ever okay it's no masterpiece but it's not bad i was warned against seeing it but i'm sure glad i did
<START> it seems to me that stephen king's bachman pen name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer rawer more mean spirited stuff that he wanted to write without 'contaminating' his 'brand name' if you look back at the bachman books running man the long walk roadwork thinner you notice they have a sealed in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream king i realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated blood covered emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom but mainstream king always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly btw pet semetary could have easily been a bachman book if king hadn't revealed the alias by then and the dark half seems to be at least partially about his bachman persona br br thinner was the last bachman book and man with its themes of class warfare revenge and death by starvation it is nasty so it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit br br what is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a tv movie of the week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release these days something like this would probably go directly to dvd or cable the makeup work and the striking motif starving to death in the midst of plenty a metaphor for the overfed undernourished american middle class if there ever was one is all that keeps you watching this misfire br br what went wrong my first thought is that the director was going for the nasty bachman vibe but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices the actors here with the exception of joe monetegna simply can't carry the movie and then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure plus he couldn't leave the plot alone and his changes don't really help the script and dialog ought to work but mostly the movie just lies there everything is muffled dull airless and no fun to watch with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting thinner and thinner and thinner br br as other have pointed out thinner is by no means the worst king movie ever made or even the second worst and it does have a dreadful compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work but first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations
<START> can i do it 'till i need glasses at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie talent is not a consideration the folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world lack any semblance of talent taste or intelligence the target audience must consist of the recently labotimized and infants who play with their own feces anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film it consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious it ends at the ludicrous the jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell usually potty or sexually related where they don't know the meaning of all of the terms they use you know like the one about daddy's car and mommy's garage to apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless since the usual standards of acting writing direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative minds behind this mess not to be judgemental but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth br br
<START> if this is supposed to be the black experience let me out at either the front or back door br br a mama's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him angela bassett the one shining grace in this film plays his over protective religious mother despite her anger at how his life has turned by the middle of the picture she really decides to accept this she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children br br this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap you knew where this film was heading br br i literally laughed out loud when at the end when bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 he had become a man what man he had been a convicted criminal wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity and scorned society that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher br br the east coast west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained all we see are guns blazing br br a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music the african american community should take umbrage at their very being who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment
<START> just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why br br this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite i can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better or at least had gotten the little things right like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong
<START> just like al gore shook us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary movie an inconvenient truth directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet planet earth is also a wake up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world al gore showed us the bleak future of planet earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues the creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this they do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't radically change things around but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet earth in all of its amazing glory we see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful in this movie we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as forsaken deserts giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy landscapes as far as the eye could see and in all of those immensely different environments we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive br br this is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made in combination with the one from al gore in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with the voice over by patrick stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though i was watching an x men movie instead the cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary at times what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage br br in short this is definitely a must see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet earth the truth is i never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful
<START> his choice of films the basic 'conceit' of the production which places him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on and his delivery are brilliant but if you want freud be aware that you're getting zizek's version of lacan which should not be confused with lacan himself as usual zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner the rub is he is also quite mercurial and so there may be more in his gusto than in actual content cinematically it is a gem psychologically this will have people of all persuasions freudians lacanians and jungians scratching their heads but reaching for the popcorn all the same zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon unto himself
<START> i'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake br br after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment there's no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential br br and above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he's speaking yelling german br br the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened br br whether it's the english or the fact that i've already seen der untergang everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
<START> scoop out of woody allen is definitely not my favorite director but i enjoyed match point it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in it br br scoop is woody allen's latest film and though he appears in this one it's ok it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect together br br johansson plays sondra pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe strombel ian mcshane joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the reaper has taken one of those souls is the secretary of peter lyman hugh jackman she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of england joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra during a magic act sondra is at some magic show with magician sid waterman woody allen she becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from joe not knowing what to do she enlists the help of sid waterman to help her crack the case br br this film has a nice light hearted feel to it compared to match point and yet it all works johansson and allen work great together allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role hugh jackman is terrific as peter layman the suspected serial killer br br this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself i say give it a chance because you just might like it
<START> it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us but that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men's cvs no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what 'some like it hot' and 'one million years bc' did for maryln monroe and raquel welsh respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in '10' bo's reputation an all star cast and location filming in sri lanka meant that nothing could go wrong alas as they say mortals plan and god laughs it is said that when this film premiered in 1981 the edgar rice burrows estate tried to take legal action against it bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn of the century africa to be reunited with her boozy abusive dad richard harris daddy parker is an explorer who has set out to find 'the great inland sea' the stuff of local legend whose existence has been poo pooed by conventional wisdom harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy tanked up performance which includes singing an irish ditty at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa did it arrive at the same time as the orang utan from sumatra furthermore although jane professes to despise parker bo and rich's relationship is creepily incestuous testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat before long however local legends start to circulate about a 'great white ape' and jane hears the famous yodel this is the movie's cue for miles o'keefe a future b movie star making a rather odd debut as the loin clothed lord of the jungle unlike johnny weismuller with his pidgin english or ron ely who speaks the language fluently the o'keefe tarzan is mute given some of bo and richie's dialog though this is probably not a bad thing harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across africa hang on aren't seas lakes and other watery places generally located in low lying areas nevermind it is just one of many anomalies in the john derek universe the crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths on another occasion jane decides to take a nude swim by the inland sea giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity out of nowhere a single male lion appears now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on tarzan will be wrestling with a venomous boa constrictor zoology doesn't seem to have been one of john derek's strong points this being a tarzan movie jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and resolves to take his virginity but having seen his closeness to some of those chimps you do have to wonder speaking of which it's not only the edgar rice burroughs estate could have sued it is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers the chimps here make you miss cheeta badly especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice eat execute her suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and spoiler harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk this doesn't stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane as far as i am aware the law suit from the rice burrows estate never materialized but 'tarzan the ape man' was crucified at the box office no kidding a pity john derek could have directed 'tarzan the ape man 2' with bo derek and miles o'keefe living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as 'boy '
<START> i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere br br i was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that thou shalt not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten commandments and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well
<START> i recently rented this doc having remembered hearing about it from imdb com and being intrigued by the premise i knew very little about either of these bands but i do remember hearing not if you were the last junkie on earth by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it that being said this is my perspective on the doc br br one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands the director ondi timoner wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols i think that is part of what makes this doc so good and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian br br i also loved how the story of these bands was told most of what you see is of the bands on tour both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry throughout the film each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm however it is this that makes the two bands similar and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions br br i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries or either of the bands an appreciation for music helps but the music itself takes a backseat to the love hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols
<START> saw this again recently on comedy central i'd love to see jean schertler memama and emmy collins hippie in supermarket cast as mother and son in a film it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made hats off to waters for making a consistently funny film
<START> this is shallow hedonism and or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancÃ©e is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex who cares all of the characters except for anne deborah kerr are vacuous and vile seberg is poor i agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review the plot plodded this predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half if you want to see great gowns and jewels on the riviera i recommend to catch a thief in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters br br i like for films to entertain me i personally don't really care where a film is set whatever the time or place i want a good story comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters it doesn't hurt if i can relate to them poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance and so does david niven in a despicable role br br the 2 rating is solely for kerr and niven and for the cinematography the rich color scenes and the murky foreboding black and white scenes unfortunately all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un enjoyable characters a sow's ear is still a sow's ear consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time
<START> good performances can't save this terrible script larded with every cliche in the chick flick book both main characters are deeply unsympathetic and the scene where laura linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son which i think is supposed to be poignant is just horrifying
<START> this is still the benchmark to judge all golden age whodunnits by and taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities on screen bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and tv fast and furious with plenty of warner bros wipes and thankfully no time for a love interest it gallops along taking the splendid cast with it to the violent end i never understood why the da had to trail vance around everywhere i always thought they were deskbound palette as the detective but especially girardot as the doctor are delightfully eccentric and un pc when glancing over the second murder victim he sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway of course it is william powell as philo vance and michael curtiz as director that makes the film what it is when did powell ever make a dud br br the army of cops at the crime scene didn't really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they the best bit is where vance narrates to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders dodgy model sets combine with fantastic roving camera angles to produce a very modern feel and startling with what has gone before the only problem is as usual the conclusion can't match the overall deductive processes displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is invoked some chan's moto's and many others of course could only be concluded this way too but because it happens so fast and is slightly dubious morally it doesn't lessen my opinion of kmc's status as a classic br br all the prints i've ever seen of kmc are at worst like looking into a goldfish bowl so if you're interested in seeing it bear with it until you're sucked in
