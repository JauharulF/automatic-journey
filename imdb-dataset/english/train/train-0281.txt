<START> i just saw this film yesterday br br my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gere br br i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor actress is in it i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat as of me since i paid already i wanted to see the end at least just in the hope something good would turn up but i didn't hold my breath and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the same br br this is not a black and white film it's a black and black one the main character richard gere is almost as bad as his registrants and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad speak of a clichÃ© and the exploitation of a typical us phobia br br richard gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best totally unconvincing for the job br br the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap dramatic and sensational turn that just is unreal they just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders vigilante beating rape and torture something that almost seems gratuitous they even have a wolf attacking people in the film how low can you get br br i gather the film won't come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd that's were it should have stayed in other countries too but because it's hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it believe me without gere the film is not even worth a b series movie
<START> i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne's waitress 2007 this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie adrienne was a marvelously talented writer director an original and unique artist she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge male lead reg rodgers looking like judd nelson is fine there is also a great cameo by ben vereen the song at the end of the movie the bastard song written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy br br it's a world of suffering br br in a sea of pain br br no matter how much sun you bring br br you're pummeled by the rain br br don't let the heartless get you down br br don't greet the heartless at your door br br don't live among the heartless
<START> robert standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle's film br br the story is about a rich powerful planter peter finch who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride the plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life for this reason taylor Â elegant as never in dazzling costumes Â finds herself in a strange atmosphere the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals br br in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman dana andrews who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love br br with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent br br the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self respect than most of her other willful debutante rebelsÂ the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit forÂ
<START> i saw this recently and i must say i was moved by the factual basis of the story however holly as a movie did not quite work i am however looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because i think that would be a much more compelling work than this film br br the international cast was composed of b class actors but their acting was appropriate and i must give a special mention for the young actress who played holly this was her first movie role and she did a very nice job considering hers is the most challenging part br br ron livingston was adequate but bland as patrick the american whose quest is to save holly but chris penn was good in this his final role unfortunately despite my mostly favourable opinion of virginie ledoyen and udo kier both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film br br i believe in the film's message and intention but i have to be fair so i rate holly 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie but i think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and i am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which i hope will have its debut on bbc and other tv networks
<START> this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales the first one is the verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course br br the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another 15 minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time afterall br br the 3rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it's not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing br br overall i give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively
<START> this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together i don't know who made it but it has a slightly disney esque feel while parts of it are improbable like when a pre teen runs for a public office and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously there is a healthy dose of normalcy whatever that is to keep things balanced and in perspective the acting is alright strangely the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit off it's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend her grandmother and her two passions ballet and baseball being a baseball player myself it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces i read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful overall it was a good film about honesty and ambition but its star mischa barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in lawn dogs lost and delirious and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in the 6th sense
<START> most of the episodes on season 1 are awful there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of amazing stories are well dull not amazing in the least go rent or buy the twilight zone series i have heard season 2 of this series is much better also for some reason on the dvd's they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering
<START> any story comprises a premise characters and conflict characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this ardh satya's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre the line goes ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya a rough translation the delicate balance of right wrong commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another is the needle on the center a half truth br br the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant it makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow at the end of the film om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem br br the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem however chitre's words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect br br
<START> i've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict british school in the 1960's to understand this maybe that's true if so then this movie is outdated br br spoiler alert the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who're anti government and anti corporation without having any better solution that doesn't torch society to a mad max type cinder br br yeah the main characters could leave but they don't the reasons they go about this don't make sense there isn't enough character development to explain why what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have and it makes no sense br br the characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution they're just killing people i thought they might've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end that would've made greater symbolic sense but they didn't br br tl dr this movie is an adolescent's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them though in reality they need it has no moral symbolic truth or meaning to it this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in power that annoy you br br if you think a murder rampage school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like then i guess you'll love this movie if you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly very blindly in this movie rebelling against the man this movie is juvenile and boring br br you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder br br all in all this seems like a very rough draft of what could've been an okay movie but no effort is put into the dialogue character development or moral so it's just poorly done br br if only i could get my two hours back
<START> like all cult tv shows there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever while several of them are indeed wonderful classics the truth is for every great episode there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank however like die hard trekkies these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold in fact this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch br br while this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst it is poor by any reasonable standard a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldiers going past her home in the end a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here
<START> a kind of road movie in old fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases you see that the trousers part is missing on a flag of mourning appearently his father has died in the train he meets a young lady and almost without words but many small gestures a wonderful love story begins it's a somehow surreal very poetic and a little bizarre movie with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details
<START> uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young the journalist on whose real life experiences this movie is based the key word here is based how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom br br sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it this involves him selling out and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity however they are not overdone the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney's misadventures the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid well meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer this contradiction is never that much of an issue because simon pegg as sidney projects likability too well br br jeff bridges underplays sidney's editor a little too effectively and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney's affections and with regard to megan fox who plays an airhead bimbo starlet i can say only this just say the word miss fox and i will leave my wife sell all my belongings and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort of course given that i'm a fat 56 year old english accountant you might not find my offer too enticing but it's there on the table anyway given how short her career has been so far one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become however she does it sweetly with some skill and extremely sexily this girl will go far br br there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk gillian anderson and danny huston from the us br br there are several laugh out loud moments and i smiled most of the way through as ever the f word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to although at least a couple of these are very funny
<START> the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today i'd go out to see it again br br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson's oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoo's nest burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play he fleashens out the story and the characters br br here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it it's just a wonderful film
<START> i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldn't be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is well just a grade above amateurish it's nothing more than a b or c grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designer br br like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plot's actually ok for a sg flick br br i'll never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness br br too bad i miss kelly lebrock br br jimbo
<START> there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience it presents a simple story told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going then just gets better and better clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own likeable and funny hilariously so towards the end welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre
<START> i though this would be an okay movie since i like zombies and horror movies in general but i did not think it would be such a piece of sh t like it was the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors i wouldn't ever call them actors the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters there is no fun at all in this piece of sh t only horror but not in the way the director intended i would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again ugh
<START> instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys monkeys are funny people with amnesia who don't say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny br br black comedy there isn't a black person in it and there isn't one funny thing in it either br br walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack it's labeled unrated i think they took out the topless scene they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isn't there any more br br the acting seemed ok to me there's a lot of unfathomables tho it's supposed to be a city it's supposed to be a big lake if it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats
<START> i believe they were telling the truth the whole time u cant trust anything in the wild they family went through hell those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them but still having to deal with the rumours as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister i cant believe this case went on for so long seems like the jury couldn't see the truth even if it bit them on the ass i feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i would i have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it after watching this movie i was in tears and had to check on my little girl in bed i think everyone should watch this
<START> 8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the hennessy clan mother cate katey sagal daughters bridget kaley cuoco and kerry amy davidson and son rory martin spanjers look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul john ritter the family patriarch cate's parents james garner and suzanne pleshette lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's and 90's that used to be on abc
<START> i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story the acting by nolte lee arkin and the supporting cast was superb the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details
