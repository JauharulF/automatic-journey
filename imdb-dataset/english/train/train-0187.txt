<START> a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore which leaves him hideously disfigured five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion of course an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors writers directors mark ezra peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichÃ©s which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun fake jump scares prowling steadican shots a fierce storm an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity a totally ridiculous what the hell supernatural climax tacky make up f x and one of those lovably lame it was all just a terrible dream fake out non endings moreover the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer a lady taking an acid bath a guy being crushed under a huge tractor and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick the cast all give solid performances with especially stand out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank and donna yeager as foul mouthed slut stella co producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny harry manfredini's moody rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his friday the 13th scores alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick good trashy fun
<START> from the beginning of the movie it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made he has gone in the opposite way he had a type of move that he wanted to make and wrote a story to suite it and he has failed in it very badly i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort in the credit of the director he knows the media that he is working with what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie and the actors also have given a decent performance
<START> every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing before davis co stars with leslie howard in of human bondage she'd been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was 'robbed' of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockney speaking waitress unwed mother manipulative boyfriend user mildred rogers the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in dangerous i imagine davis' fans of of human bondage who agree with the oscar robbing legend are going to have at my critique's contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didn't award her performance the 1936 film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937 br br i've tried to view all of bette davis' motion pictures tv interviews videos advertisements for wwii tv performances in popular series in hindsight it is easy to recognize why this film of human bondage gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only 25yo when the film was completed just about to reach hollywood's red carpet the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human bondage that is what makes it her legendary performance but rko saw her greatness in the man who played god borrowed her from warners to play rogers br br i'm going to go with the afi in hindsight some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous 2 years later by doing so the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywood's most talented 20th century actors because from of human bondage onward davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue doubtless she deserved more than 2 oscars perhaps as many as 6 br br dangerous provides an exemplary contrast in davis' depth of acting characterization for it's in dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as joyce heath she's dead center on the red carpet whereas in of human bondage davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career br br perhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935 instead of a star being born an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor's greatest work br br it is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford a star whose performances still don't measure up to davis' even anna nicole smith was a 'star' howard stern is a radio host 'star' too lots of people on stage the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck br br try comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe you'll recognize what the afi i did davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo achieved her goal by the time she was 27 she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yet br br had the afi sent her the message that she'd arrived in of human bondage davis' life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck dom instead
<START> i saw two movies over the weekend one was kaal and the other waqt both movies are made in bollywood but they are worlds apart the fundamental difference is the story and the director vipul shaw made his indelible mark with ankhen one of the best comedy hindi movies his casting of the charecteres is perfect the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome the treatment is superb with some exceptions in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy mediocre malik in this instance is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat natyam the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like kaal to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art and they surround themselves with borderline talent and they recoup the investment before the word gets around these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner film farce awards given by bollywood chamcha's and most of them are in the media
<START> trey parker and matt stone the creators of the show 'south park' return with something entirely different they create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball this sport is known as baseketball it's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter e in the title here's how you play you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot sounds simple in fact i might try it one day after the game hits the streets it soon becomes a huge success who would've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful br br my opinion br br 'baseketball' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment a definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor
<START> first this was a brave film i've seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons however i cannot begin to understand the people who've trashed this film i can see how the end may have come off extreme but i'd be lying if i didn't say i wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what jared got conversely it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it br br the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with i certainly did and intently i'm 24 years old the way the film drags made it realistic to me people have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film not only do they lose interest they demolish whatever has been built and call it rubbish when in actuality it's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as talia lugacy's br br rosario dawson displayed the numbness of self destruction flawlessly i think she portrayed maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well often times much like the films aimed at teens mentioned in the prior comment the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed isolated and lifeless dawson in my opinion manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to drone like existence in the waking hours working some dead end job to survive and distract and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings br br i thought this film told the truth and i appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape so many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning i believe that maya's face during the act was the end not the act itself not the vengeance or the meaning behind it just her face br br thank you
<START> wow what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel here are just a few gripes the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book plot has been grotesquely altered voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages which may read well but are not the same when spoken especially with chabon's writing style the acting is more wooden than a log cabin esp bechstein this is supposed to be set in 1983 feels more like 2003 br br to be fair i couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie so it's possible that it redeemed itself sarcasm i truly hope that no one paid to see this or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent a la wonder boys i like chabon as a writer but he should be ashamed of this adaptation br br no stars
<START> there are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one even if you were totally oblivious of ed wood's work one look at that commentator from plan 9 from outer space and you just know you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece just like that when i saw the first shot of uwe bolls masterpiece house of dead with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from sin city i knew i'm in for a helluva ride br br so the movie starts like this first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die you know to keep you wandering then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like karma thinks she's foxy brown or alicia my ex we broke up recently i had to study and she had to fence no i'm not kidding br br anyway this bunch of 20 somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag are going to the rave of the century rave in question being a few tents a port a potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific our gang missed the ferry but thankfully will find a way to get there the way being a fisher boat ran by kirk cpt kirk get it man whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of simpsons' cpt mcallister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer br br to make the long story short the gang gets to the island finds nobody there except some bloody t shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there no wait they do not they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze br br with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill some guys in rubber suits start running around there is some screaming and shooting our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang they go out of the house meet cpt kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house somewhere along the line they transform into a s w a t team enter the matrix the rubber suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and i start to cry because i actually paid to see this to add insult to the injury every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game over cut scene for a few characters when they die br br i seriously hate this movie it doesn't even fit in that famed so bad it's good category it's just plain bad the script is bad the zombies are awful there is no tension lines are bad actors are bad the list just goes on br br you will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful don't there are bad movies that deserve to be watched this is not one of them
<START> where do you begin with a movie as bad as this br br do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes the over the top acting the dreadful script br br no you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at i know i do i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags however cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product br br i went three days after it opened with two other mates the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own br br and that was on cheap night br br either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is br br not since the days of the avengers 1998 have i felt so short changed since watching a movie if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it br br tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up or walking off the set keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary br br mind you considering she used to be in the word any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with br br the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say fak for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street br br otherwise bargepoles required br br
<START> i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level it's boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been 65 minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isn't seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video br br noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead it's just a lame retread
<START> i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads gÃ©rard philippe and michÃ¨le morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters br br indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters the doctor is of course the major exception what michÃ¨le morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained br br this is supposedly based on a work by jean paul sartre all i could think was that if sartre's work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus' masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africa br br a well acted but uninteresting movie
<START> previous comment made me write this it says that muslims are blonde and serbs are dark because our blood is mixed this comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist look race is nothing i'm color blind i look like pierce brosnan but i'm no irish so what i might add that i am not 100 serb that i have some austrian and croat blood within me but whats the point i'm dark half breed is that so anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like lantos producer9and director is racist for me karadzhic izetbegovich milosevic tudjman they are all monsters and i blame them for destroying my life my family my country yuggoslavia hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back i am proud of being serb and i am proud of my cousins austrians croats muslims hungarians arabs yes i am from serbia and i have multiethnical family this movie doesn't show sufferings of serbs or croats within sarayevo terrible terrorism of street gangs muslim extremism i add i kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers muslim catholic or orthodox killed in this war this film is manipulation with our misery false humanitarianism's which doesn't help at all it helps lantos to fill his pockets with more doe alright
<START> you know what they say about the 70's if you can remember them you weren't there one of the few things i do remember about the 70's was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally 'underground'or counter culture perspective the groove tube if the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isn't 'fresh' anymore but hey when this movie came out it was a first and some of these skits were being done for the very first time at a time when nixon was in office the vietnam war was raging the sexual revolution was in full swing and j edgar hoover was still in charge of the fbi this is a film made before watergate broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big swipe at the establishment to make fun of it and the hippies at the same time and frankly some skits are still dead funny if you liked cheech and chong's up in smoke you will love this film br br if you want to know what the 70's were really like check out the groove tube if you liked the oscar winning network from about the same year and thought it was right on the mark in its savage look at tv you will dig the groove tube which picks up on the theme but plays from the angle of the viewers the young viewers who were turning off the tv in favor of other entertainments we had been raised on ozzie harriet leave it to beaver father knows best my three sons happy days so imagine our glee when those of us who were experimenting with the new life styles got to see a send up of the box as seen from our perspective the commercials by the uranus corporation alone are priceless good things come from uranus and the sudden break from straight film into fritz the cat style animation when the hippies eat the weed is still one of the best segues in and out of sanity i have ever seen on film br br if you liked the kentucky fried movie you will love this film and if you ever wondered why your weird uncle harold still gets a wicked gleam in his eye when thinking back to his college days this would be the perfect film to watch br br take it for what it is a memento of the times and a sassy little film that will help all of us who did forget the 70's to remember them anew
<START> savaged when it came out this film now looks handsome and sounds great a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting from gielgud kenneth haigh harry andrews and especially anton walbrook and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg preminger doesn't jump around and show off his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect and graham greene's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity the piece has the look of a made for tv movie and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down what would mel gibson have made of the maid many drooling shots of her on the rack probably then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold preminger does none of this the burning is shown mainly through a guilt stricken reaction there are a few weak performances but not enough to cause any serious damage i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through but i was gripped in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice joan's story has unexpected resonance
<START> i don't know why i'm commenting this stupid reality show i happened to watch a few episodes of a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something i didn't watch the entire thing though only like three episodes as i was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day maybe i'm just bored today br br i feel sorry for britney i really do for all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity or she's self centered to the extreme she married the nitwit federline okay anybody can make a mistake and before that she starred this horrible show about her everyday life with him where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it no matter if it is in someone's face or into the shower as federline is standing in there she's babbling about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination i don't care for my part but i can't help wondering how she feels about it now when she's divorced and yes for her sake i'm embarrassed but i shouldn't be she seem to live a pretty empty shallow life though i don't want to swap lives with her even if i could road kill tv if you like
<START> this is a great film touching and strong the direction is without question breathless good work to the team i feel so sorry for marlene by the grace of god go you or i
<START> i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the wwf style cinemtography will make you cry where's the tripod the filmakers aimed high but sorely missed their mark
<START> the tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while i was studying cinema so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete believe me going through hell is much much easier our professor told us that this is some film but he never thought that we'd disagree or assume the apposite i don't think that there is any gods on earth we're only humans so all the filmmakers therefore they can make mistakes bad movies or very bad too the main problem wasn't that art by all means is susceptible to endless points of view but that a lot of people just don't get it that every single human got his own genuine taste his own opinion hence what i suppose it the greatest movie ever made can also be your worst one ever and how that is right both ways but how many people can understand this correctly so my professor believes in this movie and simply i don't however the only way to evaluate this thing is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society's mentality imagination and nature to tell you the damn truth mr pier paolo pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place the movie is so ugly i can't stand this so how about analyzing it then discovering the potential beauty in it it's beyond your mind hideousness and strangely not for the sake of the movie's case or anything it's for the sake of the unstable vision of pasolini his work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent the deadly cinematic technique the effective sense of silliness and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious look at the atrocious acting the unfruitful cinematography the awfully poor sets oh my god i've got the nausea already it can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor there are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this so originally how to continue that just to review it fairly actually you don't as this very movie doesn't treat you fair at all there is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera i'm trying to connect some things like that with pasolini's end as murdered
<START> i just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed br br besides being poorly written it was boring i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script br br first bite was clichÃ© without being ironic over the top seriousness without being funny the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film i can't recommend this film it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
<START> gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination he is also homosexual and catholic prone to catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant or so it seems on a trip to flushing he is 'seduced' by christine when he discovers that christine's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he's been fancying from afar he decides to stick around after all enforced heterosexuality has its compensations then he realizes that christine's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths did christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend herman going to be 'the fourth man' verhoeven's overheated over egged melodrama is a delicious blend of hitchcock and david lynch full of ott eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red a lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of gerard's imagination the fun is in figuring it out also the fact that christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish gerard or the bullish herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her in fact it's fair to say gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough super performances too from jeroen krabbe and renee soutendijk and easily verhoeven's best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci fi starship troopers
