<START> let me be up front i like pulp however it is like one of these easier dives that you see at the olympics it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painter br br this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle br br however quite why it has been given a worst film razzie is baffling i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006 but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim br br head case and popular novelist catherine tramell sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she can't even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood style br br yes clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of b s risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt br br for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur br br in to this heady mix comes roy washburn a strange welsh sounding david thewlis who tells the love struck doctor in his capacity of policeman of many years standing that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too glassy eyed to realise or care like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime time mike tyson he ripe for the big take down however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himself br br now comes millena gardosh charlotte rampling a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isn't barking mad or else a murder suspect presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stone's thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesn't think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting br br after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff hanger twist that while as farcical as the rest of the movie gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct 3 highly unlikely this may be at this point in time
<START> oscar wilde's comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy doubtless the hays office insisted preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version
<START> i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day i was going to school at hunter college i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again but like many i was curious to see what this was all about tears came to my eyes watching this documentary all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible if you have not seen this documentary do yourself a favor and check it out it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes but it's an incredible document of this countries darkest hour
<START> watching floored by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind my god this looks like a really bad sitcom sure enough it turns out that fbl is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada poor poor canada br br cara shirley ng and janet natalie sky are a lesbian couple living in vancouver janet has come out to her mother already but cara's parents are still in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from malaysia for her younger brother's wedding that same week british columbia legalizes gay marriage with janet wanting to wed cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents that's she's gay will she would she could she cara's situation is contrasted with that of jesse trent millar jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen his biological father daniel andrew mcilroy is coming for a visit soon his stepfather norman michael robinson fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are harmed by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not will dialing 1 800 makeover help br br the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950's program along with the overdone physical emoting the full house style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail mcilroy millar sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with it's no surprise that none impress it's possible that the campiness was purposeful it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten the rewrite would focus on floored by love being a poor and ineffective send up of old sitcoms br br writer director desiree lim has put together a by the numbers bland fest that's entirely forgettable there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen that time is gone in this day we need quality as well
<START> damn i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it br br the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind blowing to me br br the cgis are quite bad imho but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just just a genius perfect combination for such a movie the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable the plot is so good br br however although the movie had little flaws like e g sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too slow but i don't mean the scenic parts by that i totally loved those br br also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story like when he is in the underground bunker like thing of digicorps where all their data is saved and has this conversation with the guy down there but that may also just be me d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized they should have made the getting back true memory part a bit longer and louder but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
<START> i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don't wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don't need you i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize
<START> was convincing the world that he didn't exist br br this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold i mean sose br br i got another one like that the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline br br this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film making i have seen in a long time it starts out so well with really fantastic cinematography great acting and a very smart premise but alas the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self destruction and it does so not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist cuts br br pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story and they vary from a story set totally in someones head playing chess with himself to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming br br and that's all jolly swell but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story and apart from that it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like fight club kill bill casino the usual suspects snatch magnolia and shachnovelle and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here it's a blatant robbery br br what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed if this movie was a roller coaster ride you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved that if it was a cocktail you'd be needing a life supply of hurl buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going you get pulled in yet another one br br i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway being the next david lynch or something br br 1 10 for totally violating one's own work ritchy seek professional help what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art piece food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating clubs br br spare your soul and stomach avoid at all cost
<START> first of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either well enough ranting this is a very beautiful film the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists the film covers about half the trilogy fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers and moves at a good pace the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but aragorn looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading the books are even better give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago br br also of particular note peter jackson's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi's jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort
<START> i am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho hum event wm c quantrill was barely shown in the film probably the most intriquing figure of the period frank james was never mentioned cole younger ditto and bloody bill anderson who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about how sad the costumes were wonderful however as was the location shooting in missouri i hope ang lee will make another film from the period and try again or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on
<START> the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in 300 neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody 1 10 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero
<START> i enjoyed the story by itself but the things that i learned about wwi planes boats make this movie a must see the close ups on the plane the torpedo boat how they were used were completely new to me i heartily recommend
<START> dance fools dance is an early crawford gable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william blakewell penniless bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers the head man is jake luva portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early '30s mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luva br br gable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bert br br it's always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception
<START> it's awesome in story mode your going from punk to pro you have to complete goals that involve skating driving and walking you create your own skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team you can pick a team to be on and you then start your own team there are many levels like new jersey manhattan and even school ii not part of story mode though from tony hawk's pro skater 2 you can unlock secret skaters like iron man gene simmons and another skater you can create your own goals like skate letters combo letters tricktris gap and much more you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak if you get bored of doing that you can do the premade goals in premade parks the only thing i didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars 9 10
<START> first things first i'm not a conservative and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think it's safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eye to eye on politics in fact i'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis' bbc docs are my point is this don't discredit this review by thinking i'm not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war inc there's no question wi's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic but the problem is the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suit br br as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions cusack his co writers director joshua seftel and even the actors involved no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altman's m a s h unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moore's canadian bacon br br the current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as a result tragic pathetic and regrettably comical just watch the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is you can't write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to compete br br the main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry to get it done cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank one of his best films changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton the neo cons and the us occupation of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive the trouble is it isn't by now these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a right wing christian these jokes insultingly simple br br perhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced subversive offensive and fattened up with detailed research insights into the occupation as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with so little finesse subtlety or satirical wickedness they did little more than make me groan homer simpson once said it's funny 'cause it's true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny the bottom line hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning us neo conservative politics it's already a big enough joke br br http eattheblinds blogspot com
<START> pandemonium is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny believe me when i tell you i love comedies especially comedy spoofs airplane the naked gun trilogy blazing saddles high anxiety and spaceballs are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre pandemonium is not up there with those films most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't all that funny there are a few laughs in the film but when you watch a comedy you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this film has going for it geez scream had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film how bizarre is that br br 1 2 out of four
<START> to call a movie like thinner bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore un talented no news but how they got that way is what people want to know br br as far as this movie the book was good even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the be careful what you wish for genre burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father constantine from tv's room 222 to several pounds a day br br like i said it starts out good but why involve the mobster mantegna why fire automatic weapons so much why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes diseases death gypsy lore and such br br but no it's not to be remember this is stephen king we're talking about br br and the ending almost the same as the book but a little too talky in fact the whole movie talks too much feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us not that i expected the dead zone but i could have done without another pet sematary thanks anyway br br one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job however the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me thinner
<START> if i'm going to watch a porn movie i prefer it to have some sort of plot and a descent dialogue behind bedroom doors is one of the few i've come across with those attributes br br the new girl next door scams on the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned chelsea blue i mean brooke lavelle is the choice actress to play the part of the blackmailing seductress and plays the part magnificently chelsea blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress the movie get's an overall 10 just because she is in it her partner in the movie monique alexander is a definite cutie the two should do more work together in this movie though monique who plays gigi doesn't have a whole lot to do or say that's too bad she seems like she has more talent to be shared i like the girl who was the possible da's wife next i forget her name but she's pretty good looking and not a bad actress nicole sheridan i'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about it's obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for which is okay but is she finished sorry but come on i'm afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some except chelsea's talent and beauty overrides any negatives overall this movie is a good one
<START> this movie isn't very good it's boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them no wonder this went straight to cable br br final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie you're a sucker if you waste your time on this
<START> i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons br br but now with season 5 or is it 6 things are getting just plain too tiring br br i used to like the show but its become donald trumps own ego fest granted its his company you'll be working for but come on some of the things says you're fired is just insulting br br after watching the show i would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm good entertainment yes but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack
<START> bill paxton of aliens near dark and terminator fame surprises me with his debut as director for frailty he hits on all cylinders but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the fbi agent powers booth which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller other than that this movie was just fine br br bill paxton plays dad he's never given a first name but that is not a weakness of the film it in fact strengthens the film allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons fenton meiks matt oleary and adam meiks jeremy sumpter must fine the demons and kill them the demons look like normal people which they kill and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind or is he really doing god's work there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense br br the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up matthew mcconaughey and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle powers booth who is very skeptical and rightfully so after all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is br br the film has many twists and bill paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest the acting is incredible the two young leads and paxton work great together looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder like i said there is the one implausibility involving powers booth's character but it really isn't a big thing this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family
