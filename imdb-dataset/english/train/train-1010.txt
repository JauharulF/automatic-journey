<START> i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me as a huge fan i was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong yesterday my bubble got burst big time boys and girls because i saw the movie br br the first act where it's set up that he hates his life he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god is serviceable the second act where he's summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty is great carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch really funny but the third act is wretched beyond belief br br the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace jennifer aniston who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device even her name reeks of unsubtlety she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead he tells her on bended knee yet that he's finally getting his news anchor job and isn't it so exciting br br she doesn't think so she wants him to marry her see so she winds up leaving him see even though she still loves him very much see and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic beyond heavy handed spiritual sounding cliche after the next until by the end i was praying too for it to be over br br i didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example in the 2nd act after he gets his powers bruce prances into the room singing what if god were one of us just a slob like one of us blah blah blah and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us for openers morgan freeman a k a god tells bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this a lot those choices were forgivable this is a jim carrey comedy directed by tom shadyac it aint the remains of the day br br or rather it was supposed to be a comedy when the script writers lose track of that in the dreaded act 3 and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag message movie what we get instead is hell on earth bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways he realizes that grace is his saving have to say it grace and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy handed way however the film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points unfortunately the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever light handed way so they went the bang 'em over the heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out takes at the end in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste it didn't work for me
<START> we gave up at the point where george clooney's character has his finger nails extracted we were not squeamish having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over praise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseud's corner of a film let alone nominate it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid air the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available
<START> simply one of the funiest movies i've ever seen it's a parody of crime life parody of everything that represents the chicago 1930 there is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5 its a opinion of a mass and mass is hypnotized who decide to watch it it will regret who decide not to watch it will regret more
<START> an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of temuco br br film debutant daniella rios is the seductive erotic dancer gracia working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini wave in chilean film production alejandro trejo the elder brother played maturely by nestor cantillana is easily convinced to become trejo's lead henchman after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother victor's juan pablo miranda seventeenth birthday from the establishing shot of this opening scene the film explodes into neo noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn't usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic br br gracia's charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey although the circular narrative of the three way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between trejo's men and the 'gringo' eduardo barril power relations become a vital theme as society's outsiders merge in a mini family the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society and is seen as holding the key to all three men's futures the relationships between trejo and cantillana become important as the boys' parents are conspicious by their absence one assumes they still live in temuco therefore it is trejo el padrino who 'adopts' cantillana and effectively 'makes him' as a man in the city miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider as his dependency on his 'father figure' cantillana becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia however miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school he is dependent on cantillana who is dependent on trejo for the money to survive trejo in turn is under the thumb of the 'gringo' and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs the figure of gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax br br as the tensions of these power relations come to head gracia remains ambiguously elusive the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to the film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists the final shot of miranda's beaten face speeding down the panamericano highway is despairingly powerful the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city's underworld yet has lost his only visible family and his woman who is his only friend in the film he has nothing the overriding metaphors are bold and brave this is a gangster film in chile the notions of family no sex before marriage etc are abolished and instead the harsh realities of the other side of santiago's coin are displayed in all their savage glory trejo beats rios brutally rios and miranda make love in a cinema reel room a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows the 'gringos' are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation but not through the copper mines through the illegal path of drugs br br waissbluth's triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld which raises so many social questions more perhaps than the record breakingly successful sexo con amor within a slick smooth firecracker of a film which place this film firmly alongside sexo con amor taxi para tres and el chacotero sentimental as cinematic evidence that chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post transition period 15 years after the censorship of the military regime
<START> as a kid i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent this movie as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost hypnotic music shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer this is a whole package deal between the music and the video that really packs a one two punch if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation this is a must have br br i still almost 20 years later rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites the originality i think is still unsurpassed by most of today's mcmovies that hollywood spits out i am currently wanting to see if i can re make it on my own if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation
<START> a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him br br this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my underestimation as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet br br the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser 2 however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser 2 br br some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn't watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it's confusing the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he's somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he's completely unlovable br br while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genre's future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring schmidt back for season 3
<START> this is the result a piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel that makes no sense whatsoever well back to the actors which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film well it's a great horror anyway nevermind being a film there's plenty of horrific acting in hobgoblins but the worse is the main guy named richard who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for well when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary on a less than shoestring budget no less this is what will happen oh well at least the mst3k version was hilarious but this is still a horrid movie that deserves all the bashing it gets 9 for the mst version
<START> if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end i can't believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing amber's mom is laughable i'm from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
<START> although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films after watching this movie on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down even if it just helps cleanse me once again br br the film was possibly the shallowest experience i've ever had the main characters played by danny dyer 23 you sure and gillian anderson who will always be scully as leonard nimoy will always be spock had no real substance about them i'm not sure if the first half hour of the film didn't make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims here i couldn't care less in fact the only character i did seem to care about was the dog with the stag coming a close second and both animals out acted dire sic and scully who were quite frankly terrible i guess though you're only as good as the script you are given and i'd like to warmly thank the writers the producers the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity
<START> i don't know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero thriller flick and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors br br at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the 'things are going to be ok' type of a feeling i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance
<START> as low budget indies go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didn't pay much for frightworld br br writer director david r williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer not a bad premise but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience by constantly using shaky quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us this becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the would be killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun house but with an extremely long running time it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell br br there is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies br br fans of really bad b movies might find something of interest here otherwise don't spend a lot of cash
<START> until today i had never seen this film its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers br br frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit lionel atwill dwight frye faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother's maiden name br br this is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it br br leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes the overlook film encyclopedia quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60 63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long personally i think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film br br what ever the running time if you like creaky old films do by all means do watch this movie its a great dark and stormy night film
<START> yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen worse think gremlins rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some sci fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in br br he seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the mst3k version br br all in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys
<START> well were to start this is by far one of the worst films i've ever paid good money to see i won't comment on the story itself it's a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera to start with the acting except for eric bana is soap opera quality i've always been a fan of brad pitt but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame the camera action doesn't help either how it lingers on him when he's thinking it just takes me back to brooke forrester's days in the lab peter o'toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one either way he looks more like linda evans than linda evans and to end my comments diane kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no helen of troy peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now
<START> the trouble with the book memoirs of a geisha is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesÂso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters br br the movie isn't about japan or real geisha it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha is it pure fantasy as so many people have said yes but then why make it into an american fantasy br br there were so many missed opportunities imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang ups no connotations of sin about sex sex is natural and normal how is sex handled in this movie right like it was dirty the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch br br does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie nope one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha br br did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off nope she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it and that is what i mean about this movie why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong br br behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity he could have rigged the auction and won her himself nobu didn't even bid so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and reeking of old man stink get his fingers all over her naked body would any woman ever really forgive a man for that br br let's try to make sense of this by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri's geisha training in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr crab through mameha the chairman sold sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her the chairman wasn't her patron he was her pimp some romantic love story br br yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrong br br some contrasts between japan and moag br br japanese style Â refined elegant simplicity moag style Â peking opera br br japanese geisha Â hair swept up moag geisha Â loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup br br japanese shaved ice japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances shaved ice is strictly a summer treat moag shaved ice the chairman buys chiyo the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo this treat during cherry blossom viewing season the thought made my entire body shiver with cold br br japanese geisha Â trained and skilled entertainers moag geisha sluts br br japanese wind chime used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze japanese people feel somehow cooler moag wind chime a door bell if a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance br br japan Â emphasis on human relationships group oriented moag Â i want a life that's mine american individualism br br japanese traditional dance Â refined elegance an almost geometrical and mechanical precision moag dance Â martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not very auspicious white japanese funeral shroud performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club ha ha ha is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha br br japan house fire Â setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people moag house fire great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out of control fire miraculously puts itself out technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled br br enough the movie stinks
<START> tom wolfe's sprawling brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie kewpie doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis as the darling of new york's literati the most serious miscasting was in the director's chair robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting but brian de palma for all of his visual sophistication has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status honestly if a satire does not make the viewer angry what is the point
<START> i am a very big fan of jenna jameson but this movie is horrible at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the hottest porn star ever so of course brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film now i know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore in a fantasy world porn stars could act but this is the real world and they can't act that's why there porn stars if a women as beautiful as jenna could act then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star a fine example of this is traci lords when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act where is she now i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot but there are better movies she has made then dream quest come on jenna we don't want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex also you jenna would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film
<START> i chuckled a few times during this movie i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover pun intended br br there are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman 'grows up' and launches career movies the tampaxÂ® box was the funniest thing in this segment most of the cast members aren't listed here on imdb they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers br br the second segment is a spoof of sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry movies robert culp has several funny moments all physical humor including the aforementioned handover after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch snow i switched to pakistani music videos instead i don't understand urdu or whatever language the videos were in it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story br br then came municipalians with the big stars half of them on screen for less than a minute elisha cook jr christopher lloyd rhea perlman henny youngman julie kavner richard widmark and robby benson it's supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened substance abusing older cop who needs retirement badly movies the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive it was interesting seeing old rtd buses and a shell gas station sign and an american savings sign none of them are around anymore nagurski's never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile momentarily then they discuss how boring the young cop is a lot back and forth about how boring he is that was as boring as this description of how boring it is nagurski's law number four never go into a music store that's been cut into with an acetylene torch made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave thinking about that was more interesting than the set up for the gag which followed young falcone benson gets shot a lot he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski the segment keeps going on and on and on it won't stop it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he'd just die already so this thing will end it doesn't it goes on and on and on then a buffy the vampire slayer episode which i've seen four times already comes on thank god this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail
<START> this movie is a farce names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous cannon crossbow weapon beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off grendel's arm with his bare hands and i can't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a die hard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldn't recommend it
<START> seriously what is this hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre then he made this god awful film what happened did he dip into the crack a little too much this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on fire firestarter anyone the acting was godawful the plot was rubbish and the special effects were extremely rubbish they looked like something from the 70's van damme should be pleased that derailed is no longer the worst film ever and what was with the ending he started glowing blue turned into a glowing blue blob sucked out his girlfriends fire and the film ended what was that huh when the film ended i hoped the dvd would spontaniously combust to save me from my pain br br stay away from this film br br don't think obey you'll thank me later
