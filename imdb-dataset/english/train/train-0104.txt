<START> no i'm not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio i'm serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters i'm sure that when they were really young and made some o k movies some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years or something so that now that they're what 17 they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money let me advise you stay away from mary kate and ashley it's for your own good
<START> i am embarrassed to say that i missed the mother when it was in theaters i saw it this evening on dvd i gave it a 10 vote one of the very few i have given here this english independent is filmed with such great care and quality it drew me in relentlessly the story low keyed and purely human is brutally honest and utterly absorbing thanks to the acting of anne reid daniel craig and cathryn bradshaw the cinematography is stunning the score is hard wired to the plot the storyline is epic brilliantly clothed by writer hanif kureishi in mundane lives this story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting and some of those big issues are highly controversial which probably explains the lack of awards won despite many nominations it is simply one of my all time favorite films
<START> i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot after many subsequent viewings and purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out loud br br yes it's a relic of another age a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america but well executed is well executed but it's also a document of its age a celebration of post war optimism the baby boom and the nascent consumer age this film is no guilty pleasure br br three wonderful sophisticated leads actors urbane melvyn douglas bemused cary grant daffily determined myrna loy complement each other and a memorable team of characters br br my favourite scenes it means we gotta blast and miss stellwaggen and this little piggy br br love it
<START> it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go you shouldn't really decide to watch this based on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldn't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it br br couldn't they have just made earnest does dallas
<START> this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to retire by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united states br br if you can see it
<START> apparently ruggero deodato figured out early on that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously so he decided to camp it up the result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword and sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy and i think i'll go the second way the brief gore moments are well done the paul brothers openly mock the material they even bark at each other in one scene and there is also a charming spirited good natured performance by eva la rue as the girl who tags along with the boys plus where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque
<START> the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror it's not even thrilling just ridiculous even the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement it's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesn't seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this
<START> this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school watching as the rawandan genocide un furls around him br br the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic new comer a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously as he and the driver approach a road block he plays around with his drivers i d not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him suddenly realizes that every rawandan including his driver is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help the media cameras cannot stop machete's and there's too many machete wielding militia men too shoot the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead bodies around his compound but won't shoot the militia men that are killing people around the compound mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims flees with his tail in between his legs rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind br br it's more of character study and a come to jesus moment for one character than a story about the genocide in rawanda this movie didn't have to take place in rawanda it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time
<START> probably the worst dolph film ever there's nothing you'd want or expect here don't waste your time dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life his brother gets killed and dolph tries to figure things out the character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly pointless
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br a notably bad actor getting by on his now fading looks rather than any strong dramatic talent richard gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the american hollywood scene always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today but nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to dvd limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now br br he has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened cynical case worker earl babbage one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the us who along with his new protÃ©gÃ© allison allthrop claire danes must take to his latest case delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago br br this is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing and as such it's a pretty strong compelling film unflinching and not constrained by it's direct to dvd budget the only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while but it's still some of the solidest material i've seen gere in relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on
<START> this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team similar to goldie hawn's wildcats it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role and she does as about as well as the script allows i think racquel welch would have been a better choice but considering the film's apparent tv movie budget they probably couldn't afford her cathy lee does look great in every shot but we never get to see her completely nude the story is pretty predictable to say the least offering no surprises a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports this point is brought up throughout the film and needless to say is dated ironically cathy lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not so bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney wicks it looks like everyone had a good time making this film but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby she's not that great an actress but she has a dazzling smile beautiful hair and a very tan body
<START> the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face fans of run lola run tampopo go and slacker will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental
<START> to a certain extent i actually liked this film better than the original vampires i found that movie to be quite misogynistic as a woman and a horror fan i'm used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much in this movie natasha wagner is a more fully realized character and the main bad guy is a gal arly jover who played a sidekick vamp in blade is very otherworldly and deadly jon bon jovi okay yeah no great actor but he does ok at least he doesn't start to sing catch it on cable if you can it's on encore action this month
<START> i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been underwhelmed by it i subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a midnite movie double feature dvd of curtis harrington shelley winters films for a very affordable price i couldn't resist giving it a second look this has since gone out of print actually i received the dvd a few months ago but only now with harrington's passing did i get to it thankfully this time around i was more receptive to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane 1962 imitations with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter henry farrell br br the film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s depression america with its child star craze and sensational murders exploited during the fake newsreel opening it's stylishly made kudos to lucien ballard's cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie' and boasts an effective david raksin score shelley winters debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the larger than life and vaguely sinister diction coach though he ultimately proves a mere red herring also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead hers is only a cameo really as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio br br many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing mae west imitation but i personally wasn't bothered by them the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot reynolds a musical star herself is ideally cast as the dancing school owner and despite their on set rivalry she and winters work well together the latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo 1971 the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignol type denouement apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism by producer martin ransohoff against harrington's wishes in order to get a pg rating
<START> this sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 broadway revival that was such a 'nostalgic' hit keep in mind that when burt shevelove directed that revival he rewrote the book extensively i have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well i played the 'innocent philanderer' jimmy smith on stage in 1974 and thought this 1 dvd would bring back memories not a chance even the anticipated delight of seeing topper roland young play 'my' part was a major disappointment three songs from the play remain and are done very poorly even the classic duet tea for two is done as a virtual solo the many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all and the star anna neagle just embarrasses herself when i feel gypped by spending a dollar i know the film must be bad another commentator mentioned the doris day version which is actually called tea for two and is about doing the stage play the original of course so those who are seeking the true no no nanette might find a more recognizable version there
<START> spoilers spoilers when i saw a preview for this movie i thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline but as most superstation original movies i was left disapointed this gullible family ends up driving through this deserted town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them their are more gaps than i can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something which is never explained the next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused
<START> this was the worst acted movie i've ever seen in my life no really i'm not kidding all the based on a true story historical references aside there's no excuse for such bad acting it's a shame because as others have posted the sets costumes were great br br the sound track was typical asian style music although i couldn't figure out where the modern love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria i don't know who wrote sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500s br br the hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwik n ez battle scenes br br but the acting oh so painfully sad lines delivered like a bad junior high play if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug at times i half expected him to yell out adrian or even you wanna piece of me br br favourite line when the queen says to her lover after barfing on the floor i'm going to have a baby he responds a child i expected her to retort no jackass a chair leg duh
<START> the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded br br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided
<START> i first saw this movie on mst3k and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i don't particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcock like plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the non mst3k version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake
<START> this filmed presentation of the rime of the ancient mariner is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of coleridge's haunting poem the striking cinematography combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists and michael redgrave's superb narration are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual work br br in the age of television such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students as well as adults to explore and to learn the value of great poetry to the best of my knowledge this kind of work is indeed rare that is regrettable as a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic counselor i feel that more great epic poems like coleridge's rime of the ancient mariner should be so translated although not a movie critic but as an avid reader of classic literature i am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservations whatsoever
