<START> first i want to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyper reality it creates you don't need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in time br br i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay it all out television that leaves no room for imagination or wonder br br it's nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experience br br the hyper reality is my favorite aspect of the show the 1950's esque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure reality br br this show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to television br br pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list
<START> i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much i was wrong this is not propaganda in fact it is hardly political at all br br it depicts the events of 9 11 through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming a man we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them br br a great piece of work absolutely stunning material highly recommended br br regards
<START> about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn't try to find it anywhere then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought hey why not and tried finding it on the internet eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films i called my dad over to the computer and said to him hey dad i've found that creepy film you told me about ages ago he smiled at me turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it i started off fine then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up it made me jump p if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling br br great film
<START> it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks che parts 1 2 why because if my cuban exile parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution i would be grounded for life hey wait i am an adult they can't ground me no mas director steven soderbergh and newbie commie sorry steven but i had to take soder shots here divides the movie in two partes on commander ernesto che guevara's revolutionary life che part 1 presents how che in the mid 1950's joined fidel castro's guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow cuban president fulgencio batista's regime which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many cubans as it revolted into communism che part 2 presents che trying to revolutionize the t shirt industry by pitching t shirts with his appalling bearbado face to t shirt manufacturers ok i am che chatting a lot of crap towards your way i meant to say the 'che part 2 focuses on che in the late 60's trying to bring back the revolution this time to a poverty stricken bolivia but with far different results in fact che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the bolivian militia in 1967 soderbergh does not include the in between time of those two instances in che's life when he commanded the despicable la cabana fortress prison in cuba where he mass murdered many cubans who opposed communism that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was i did decide to see che in hopes that soderbergh would not glamorize him but instead present how disturbed he really was unfortunately soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero which he was not he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel now i do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that benicio del toro's performance as che was extremely commanding and worthy of merit and that demian bichir was a haunting dead ringer as fidel castro in his meticulous performance but the rest of the cast of che was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying guerilla soldiers and as much as i do admire matt damon why did sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish speaking cameo performance portraying a bolivian delegate soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly too much talk and not enough action in 4 hours and 30 minutes we have had too much of che already even posthumously with those ridiculous t shirts so why give us too much more of him but i guess when you have the del toro by the horns as you did here steven i guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing che parts 1 2 average
<START> the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs br br aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a disappointment br br 3 10
<START> if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed you need not look for it you will find all and more in this near perfect presentation of charlotte brontÃ«'s masterpiece br br rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based but i admit to that here although i have not read jane eyre i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me br br i need not divulge anything in the way of plot here let me just say this if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre i implore you to doubt no more every atom of might and magic that has reared jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this film br br what brontÃ« did not bring herself clarke and dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity the movie's success is no doubt due in no small part to their acting prowess br br love jane eyre or hate her but appreciate the richness the vitality the truth of the story love the characters love the actors all just as you would love what is great in cinema
<START> this isn't the best bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the sci fi channel this is quality stuff it has some action some humor decent f x and bigfoot cg is used but so are some practical f x which i like br br overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror sci fi and need a fix it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it so don't be fooled br br the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate expect a bit of a lul as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two
<START> here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel poverty riddled existence robin hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times gad according to this crap bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anybody he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them badly acted poorly filmed unbelievable dialogue unrealistic use of weaponry gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing avoid this bilgewater thumbs down 5 stars
<START> uneducated defiant beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man's land spirited bold she captures the heart of the millionaire's son but violence terror sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness br br mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid heart wrenching film she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the spunky joy enthusiasm which made her for years the world's most popular movie star the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale with mary the lovely distressed heroine beset by all manner of dangerous stressful situations the atmospherics are first rate with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well conceived br br in the supporting cast jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him hersholt a very gentle soul off screen manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption br br this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess a 1914 version had been one of her first important films but its production values were a bit antiquated by the standards of the 1920's no close ups for instance and mary producing her own films powerful enough by 1922 to make whatever film she wanted decided for the only time in her career to remake a film the end result certainly lived up to her expectations both films were very popular at the box office br br a fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of christianity in mary pickford's life it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today we are compelled to accept them as sincere reflections by their very repetition of mary's heartfelt beliefs in tess one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible she indicates to lloyd hughes who plays her sweetheart a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand he mimes it for her the word is obviously crucified' and eyes turned heavenward as the full meaning of the sacrifice dawns upon her mary's face becomes positively beatific br br a splendid new orchestral score for tess has been supplied by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty pathos of this wonderful film
<START> this movie has great fight scenes now its true that the acting is a little rough but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix then watch this now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p s his pants and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire
<START> tedious girls at reform school flick which plays somewhat like a prison movie chris linda blair is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father once in the de facto jail she is gang raped by her fellow female inmates br br overlong even at 98 minutes with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless br br 15 year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene br br 1 2 out of
<START> if you're a t rex marc bolan fan i recommend you check this out it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown a talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls watching him in concert you would never know that being a rock star is a job but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances true there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there but like any album it can't have everything i just bought this in 2006 but if i would have know it came out in 1972 i would have definitely bought it years ago sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash
<START> i sat with my children as we watched this film we all found it to be a very entertaining movie br br when billy goes to a new school a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms br br a bet is made and billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else from this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook fry or bake the worms to try and get billy sick so that he will lose the bet br br billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone even the bullies friends br br i wont tell you if he wins the bet or not you will just need to watch it to find out but i will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one br br p s let me add that this movie is not just for boys i have all daughters and they really liked it a lot
<START> take your basic frankenstein flick inject some reanimator but not the good parts and you have doctor hackenstein certainly this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own br br a scientist accidentally kills his wife so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife to revive his wife he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and coincidentally decide to stay the night at his place br br i can't really say the acting is bad nor is the directing everything here is just way too standard what little attempts there are at humor actually work check out the scene when hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle but that's hardly enough to recommend this film the music is decent what blood that's there is decent and the cast looks quite good and for half of the time i was even entertained by this film but i never felt like this was anything more than a time waster avoidable br br try frankenhooker instead
<START> well tremors i the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well
<START> you know you're in for something different when a movie has christopher walken playing the part of a professional hit man and he isn't even one of the bad guys although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there man on fire is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal and just about every tone imaginable in between br br denzel washington stars as creasy a former cia assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed so far he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the bible and not doing all that well with either as the movie opens mexico city has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well to do possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety the first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between creasy and his charge pita a sweet little girl who slowly but surely works her way into creasy's initially hardened heart and affections the last two thirds of the film turns into an avenging angel melodrama as creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story br br based on the novel by a j quinnell man on fire astutely written by brian helgeland and flashily directed by tony scott is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter it takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is for all intents and purposes achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering admittedly disreputable people these scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful even if they do at times border on the exploitative even better are the quiet intimate moments between creasy and pita in the early parts of the movie washington and the wonderful dakota fanning establish an natural easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow br br washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually in addition to the two leads there are solid performances from walken marc anthony radha mitchell mickey rourke rachel ticotin and giancarlo giannini but it is washington and the delightful ms fanning who steal the show br br man on fire would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time but this is still a better than average crime thriller
<START> after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting all in all don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night
<START> possible plot spoilers br br i adore dennis hopper i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000's the spreading ground this movie flat out sucks and i'm about to tell you why br br this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena one hitch there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court det ed delongpre has other plans he wants this guy caught too but he's on the level and believes in the system he wants to see the system do it's job br br that could have been pretty good it could have been riveting it was horrible first they label this guy a serial killer err no there are specific criteria and none of it fits here the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day and i think it was 2 the second day this entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period hardly serial killer action i don't care what warped motives they give him in the end serial killers do their deed over a long time span they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days that's a spree br br ok that irritant aside the acting was atrocious the only name here was hopper and he's the only one who came even close to pulling off his part unfortunately he's kinda type cast to me and i think he does psycho parts much much better this just wasn't a good vehicle for hopper it didn't allow him to do what he does best which is to act all creepy it's not that he did bad it's that i've seen him do so much better br br the irish mob guy johnny gault tom mccamus long day's journey into night who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff contradiction not really he is trying to play the cold hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden boring to the max he didn't scare me he didn't inspire any emotion at all except boredom i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie br br the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made for tv movie you know what i mean the poor production values low budget re use of scenes to save costs just eh yanno but i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those br br derek vanlint was both the director and cinematographer on this project he bit off more than he could chew i can't help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend that's the only rational i can come up with this was vanlint's first job as director third as cinematographer hopefully this was a learning experience for him br br i won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball here even hopper in a scene that should have been emotionally gut wrenching for the detective it was just well blah i didn't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear change this guy made very disappointing br br this 100 grueling minutes long and rated r for violence and language no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this so no worries there it's not suitable for anyone anyway heh br br skip this one you'll thank me later
<START> this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it it was sort of a remake but then again not really i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his disposal he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money 100 million but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million heck no so in that regard the film fails br br at least in the original film the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming and by the way if you give it some thought and i did you can figure out how the ending could come about i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it br br this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of beneath the planet of the apes here's how i would have written it br br an astronaut it really should have been more than marky mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys that would land on what they would think would be another planet encounter humans not mutes a city ruled by apes were hunted made friends with some good apes discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes and then well let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it br br but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film sadly tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing consider what he did with the batman series he's a rotten director inspite what of people think he's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking sorry but no if anyone else had done this film it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying
<START> this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene incoherent would be a compliment even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over i watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did by the end of this mess i was sorry any of the characters survived and i wasn't feeling too charitable about the actors either if you want to watch a train wreck i recommend hanging out at a train station even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess apparently i haven't vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so at the risk of redundancy i will say it one more time this movie is a zero and it would be less if i had a word for an even lower rating how about minus zero
