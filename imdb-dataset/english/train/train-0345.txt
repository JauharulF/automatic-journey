<START> although released among a flock of revenge minded action flicks kill bill vol 2 the punisher walking tall man on fire works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always watchable denzel washington one of the best actors around today br br in man on fire based on a j quinnell's 1980 novel first filmed in 1987 with scott glenn washington plays a down on his luck ex mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of jack daniels until his old partner christopher walken offers him a chance at redemption he is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year old daughter dakota fanning of a mexican businessman marc antony and his american born wife radha mitchell while he and fanning work like oil and water first not mixing very well he really gets to form a bond with her encouraging her to do better at swimming while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past it is that very bond that will force washington back into his old line of work when fanning is kidnapped and held for a 10 million ransom and he is nearly killed with almost any other stock action hero schwarzenneger segal etc the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before but washington's character though he's killing for a reason does not particularly enjoy doing what he does still he gets help from a very intrepid mexican newspaper reporter rachel ticotin out to expose la hermanidad the brotherhood the kidnap gang responsible for fanning's abduction br br man on fire is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work nearly headache inducing montage editing and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director tony scott top gun crimson tide but which are not necessarily unique to him witness oliver stone's use of montage in jfk or sam peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films still scott gets a very good performance from washington as well as fanning who comes across as far more than a typical movie brat kid harry gregson williams' south of the border spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of chopin debussy and even linda ronstadt's classic 1977 country rock version of blue bayou although the film overall is quite violent it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years and overall it is much better than most
<START> a surprisingly effective thriller this br br david duchovny and michelle 'ensign ro' forbes are a successful professional couple he a writer she a photographer forbes is desperate to move to california and in an act of compromise mulder agrees to the move on the condition that along the way they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers his idea he writes the words she takes the pictures with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life to help finance the trip they decide to car share and advertise the fact as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and shortly after killing his landlord he and his girlfriend juliette lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek inevitably mischief ensues br br pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and as events spiral out of control you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting br br intelligent sinister and beautifully shot this deserves recognition beyond its current status a top movie
<START> made in the same year as vertigo this is an equally bewitching movie though in a much lighter vein it's set in an enchanted new york during the winter kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart but gets caught in it instead the interesting sidelight is that novak's rival is played by janice rule who originated the part of madge in picnic on broadway the part that novak would make famous on film
<START> well finally got to see the remake last night in london unintentionally hilarious sexless and devoid of any real humour i don't really know where to start whilst i was entertained by this strange homage it didn't really move me the acting is screamingly hammy there is no original music the costumes are far too 'disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of nic cage which didn't come soon enough for my liking the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island it's such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the miner's strike very strange
<START> cross eyed is a very original and funny movie i think adam jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way this film is smart concise and consistently entertaining and funny as a writer director jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable the story is definitely something you haven't seen before which is good it's unique and fun and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy br br a very promising first film
<START> i've never been huge on imax films they're cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary br br the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbc's the human body a super sized look at the insides of our bodies br br our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted br br here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mother's womb and surprisingly a few of the um less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomach br br this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye's let's get it on it's creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well
<START> hee hee hee this movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time i remember the day i first saw this on mst sun was shining looked like a good day then i saw this product of rick sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land kevin wussy extraordinaire tries to impress his girlfriend manages an assistant security guard job fights with rakes and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images no plot or story is needed obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves an army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say he has got some nice red shorts plus i really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart just when you think it's over wait until the club scum scene ask for road rash br br i advise that after viewing this film a good month to regain senses and sanity and if you see rick sloane give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called hobgoblins
<START> new york police detective mark dixon dana andrews is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence br br when a rich texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster tommy scalise gary merrill dixon is assigned to the case scalise tells dixon's superior officer detective lieutenant thomas karl malden that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine craig stevens and his wife morgan gene tierney and that paine had committed the murder dixon goes to paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalise's place adds that her father had gone to paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father jiggs taylor tom tully had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder nobody accepts dixon's explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness br br dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine's death and the cover up he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixon's murder the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller br br dana andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paine's accidental death dixon however isn't the only one to experience misfortune as morgan a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her her father who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit ken paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise who'd been set up in business by dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes br br where the sidewalk ends is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity
<START> as b movies go it was well above average i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although i am trying to minimise any such tendency as sequels usually go it was utterly fantastic despite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original scanners br br the movie was similar in ways to the superman series in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the superman stories and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non conforming children adolescents and or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as real genius and to a more superficial degree doctor mordrid and struck a particularly strong chord br br the film had a positive message and was fun to watch i found some of the insights and accuracy in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences fascinating and even profoundly touching at times these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula driven schlock and gratuitous sex uality in this case as the sexual elements were tastefully done and violence that makes b movies or shakespearian plays for that matter so much fun to watch br br this is a must watch for all comic book sci fi remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans with the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original scanners
<START> as horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap shoot sometimes we find a real gem but many times we find that the film we've just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box such is the case with five across the eyes a title i'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out br br the story or at least what the ahem writers think passes for one centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender bender in a gas station parking lot br br in fairness it's an interesting idea some of the best horrors have very simple story lines it's in the execution of five across the eyes that this idea falls flat the film tries to be a cross between the blair witch project with its shaky camera work and the texas chainsaw massacre in its bare bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither what we get instead are redundant scenes of chase torture release chase torture release in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching moaning and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in between chase sequences br br the look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark which in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism here it's merely annoying the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard pressed to find anything to sympathize with them one character stops to get a first aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kill's you you're dead br br it was an accolade from fangoria magazine and dreadcentral com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out talk about a fake orgasm perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section i'm all for low budget indie horror but this one takes the crap cake give five across the eyes or fate get it a pass br br razorfriendly gives fate 1 slash out of five
<START> with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasn't after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows what's going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you've seen 5 sci fi movies or you are over 9 years old do yourself a favor and skip this one
<START> who's got the gold is unfortunately the last of the hanzo the razor films starring shintaro katsu as the title character the multi weapon proficient authority bucking samurai officer with the unique technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they spill the beans and beg for more br br this entry starts with hanzo uncovering a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that's filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury this leads to hanzo discovering a loan sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk the requisite swordplay and rape interrogation ensue finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films br br not quite as strong and enjoyable as the snare part 2 of the series but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese pinky style films 8 10
<START> this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion from the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator you'll be entranced it's an absolute must see for anyone interested in criminology interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great not overly done either i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history too how the police work with the political party being what it was it is truly fascinating and frustrating the settings are beautiful it's been a while since i saw this movie the first time it doesn't diminish it's impact not overly dramatic or graphic it leaves enough to the imagination well you'll see
<START> i really like 101 dalmations when it came out in 1996 now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001 i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it's more funnier more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version one hundred and one dalmations 1961 i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmations i hope there is maybe yes maybe no all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future
<START> this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all cylinders and when dianne keaton is at her best well it just doesn't get any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star br br my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person and neither was her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around br br one of the other commentators said the movie had a political agenda that is a baffling thing to say there was no politics at all in this movie
<START> this may be the worst show i've ever seen aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy it's just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look it's hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincoln's slave the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer chances are you'll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd
<START> this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball especially rapping and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a can opener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a djin and finally whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level
<START> night of the twisters is a very good film that has a good cast which includes devon sawa amos crawley john schneider lori hallier laura bertram david ferry helen hughes jhene erwin alex lastewka thomas lastewka megan kitchen and graham mcpherson the acting by all of these actors is very good the special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like devon sawa amos crawley john schneider lori hallier laura bertram david ferry helen hughes jhene erwin the rest of the cast in the film action mystery thrillers dramas and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today
<START> this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series br br compared to the live action series this show is utter crap the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap br br the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it thats basiclly the idea every episode the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god which is quite right since he's her mind control slave but this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort
<START> some genre films need to be dressed up this one was an exception taken on its own merit it's a dressed down version of the horror genre film with minimal special effects it manages to be a psychological study of sorts with a simple yet existential theme who gets hit by the bus and why her it's not a great film yet because there is little contrived about it the story works subtle and all about the interactions of the characters actually there is one contrivance in the opening scenes but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy value the need for a bit of adventure in your life and wonder what would i do in this situation
