<START> cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief the rest of the cast including john lithgow michael rooker janine turner rex linn caroline goodall and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie the action fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action drama some suspense excitement thrills and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch
<START> maybe presque rien is not the best movie ever made but it is better than many of you have said i still haven't seen a homo themed movie better than this one br br you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies with a clear beginning development and outcome but european movies are less narrative but makes you think much and feel br br many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie the purpose of this one is not show us a simple summer loving movie with commercial characters who fall in love and live happy forever summer holidays and beach are only a background and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys br br maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie because of its 3 parts showed as flashbacks these 3 moments are summertime in pornichet when they meet and love after a year and half living together in nantes mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself he tries to suicide taking something and cedric brings him to hospital later he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that the last part is when mathieu come back to pornichet in winter alone to think about how his life have changed how his life become to be and trying to find himself br br it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well because all the scenes are mixed among them but anyway as i said before this is not a funny movie if what someone want to see is meat for that we have belami movies br br presque rien what want to show us is how cruel can be the life for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life mathieu only wants to go away from home and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness but what seemed perfect at the beginning later is not as good as he thought and he become troubled and feel that he has lost the way of his life he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide br br so funny is not a funny movie very hot scenes only a few but this is not a movie for entertainment is all about feelings friendship love happiness unhappiness pain depression loneliness i as many others feel identified with life and problems of mathieu and that is what director wanted to do a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life br br for me the best homo themed movie ever
<START> i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash larded with enough indian wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new age shop starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather wearing crystal fondling idiot br br the plot alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earth's impending environmental collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar fortunately they've got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings as well he ought to be along with buckets of cheap f x and reams of pointlessly swelling music br br sure the clunky script helps to obscure the film's trite plot and staggering pace but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science
<START> i was looking forward to this ride and was horribly disappointed br br and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides br br the roller coaster part was just okay and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride br br it was visually dull and poorly executed br br it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland and failed in every aspect br br it was not thrilling or exciting in the least
<START> this movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that whine two chuckles and a headache i can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years i don't know how she lasted that long the first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the 3 99 to watch it the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster it didn't the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive note the scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the 40 ford was also quite nice this movie gets an d rating approaching an f
<START> this is a pretty bad movie but not so bad as it's reputation suggests the production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene and it does have an 80's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun watch out too for jimmy nail's brief appearance his attempt at an american accent is so astoundingly rubbish it's fantastic fantastic too are sybil danning's breasts they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 remix of sybil danning's boobs has to be seen to be believed as a horror movie it isn't scary the effects are silly and christopher lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance i guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit the two central characters the man and the woman were so negligible that i have forgotten almost everything about them and i just watched this movie earlier tonight the werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie in fact bizarrely they sometimes look more like badly burned apes the eastern european setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band babel while being pretty terrible does at least give the film some added cheese br br overall good for a laugh not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be and at the very least you've always got sybil's knockers
<START> the show is really funny nice theme jokes and one liners are really good with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show but the only major negative point of this show is the cast david spade does a great job as russell megyn price does a good job but who the hell did cast patrick warburton oliver hudson and bianca kajlich br br technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show which make viewers wanna watch the show russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man the relationship wiz with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship br br patrick warburton does a horrible job as jeff he is not at all suited for the role he is like a robot literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery br br cast is really very important for viewers to like it the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill
<START> this is the kind of movie the us doesn't make it's why people rent foreign films it's a great story about how one person even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life everybody can learn from georges it also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way i think as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending but that only makes it a better movie
<START> this is one of my all time favorites br br if the movie has a flaw it's that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him ''scarface'' is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewer's imagination br br moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tony's inexorable fate br br not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress ''scarface'' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
<START> i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one this is it br br make no mistake this film is awful br br here's a list of reasons br br hopeless storyline despite being based on a true story dreadful acting what was judge reinhold thinking unbelieveably bad stunts childish dialogue non existent continuity lack of atmosphere br br get the picture br br
<START> we faw down br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format silent br br black and white short film br br stan 'n' ollie get mixed up with a couple of floozies kay deslys and vera white after setting out to visit a theatre which burns down in their absence needless to say their tyrannical wives vivien oakland and bess flowers are not amused br br leo mccarey's ok comedy laid the narrative framework for william seiter's masterpiece sons of the desert 1934 with l h playing brow beaten victims of circumstance forced to tell a monstrous lie which backfires in spectacular fashion much of it is very funny especially the scene in which stan is teased by deslys leading to a violent game of push and shove however some of the fun is undercut by oakland and flowers playing their roles completely straight which adds an element of unpleasantness to the 'henpecked husband' scenario originally released in the uk as we slip up
<START> this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to get it but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it my late father hated arthur askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for the ghost train and old ted 'olmes transferred to me as a child years later i watch it every now and again enjoying the familiarity i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it there is much to enjoy the sequence on the train is truly inspired when askey and murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up yes it is dated and full of wartime britishness in accents and plot based on the original play by arnold ridley of dad's army fame but full of wonderful character performances including kathleen harrison as a dotty spinster the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur askey vehicle could get this is available cheap as chips in the uk on dvd so treat yourself it is a perfect saturday sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment i thank you br br old movies can be good movies
<START> worst bob hope comedy ever and that includes some heavy competition hope on an island with sailors dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl steering his ship somebody certainly steered this hope hackery over the cliff as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement where's bing crosby when you really need him
<START> the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerland's film history makes me shake my head it's true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better br br the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerter br br the acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romance part is too trashy and the comedy part is not funny at all it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever it's funny for preadolescent 12 13 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shots br br dope cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then don't expect too much br br i'll give it 4 out of 10 stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though
<START> tv pilots don't you love them quinn martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv detective movies but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of mst where it belongs roy thinnes is diamond head who takes orders from aunt mary to find super spy lovejoy i mean tree zulu and tso tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does there's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine required in the 1970's and the show itself is so anti climatic why did it not go to series you figure it out it's quite blatant again it's fun for mst but not a lot else
<START> i don't know maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action hajj but i just felt the movie is so underrated i just can't believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then about the movie it's one of those well acted sweet movies reda a french teenager due to sit for baccalaurÃ©at is asked by his devout elderly father to take him to mecca strange as it may seem if one doesn't know much about islam the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to saudia arabia on a once in a lifetime religious pilgrimage the generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms 'you may know how to read and write but you know nothing about life ' the unnamed father to his son but some sort of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations the father never speaks in french though reda understands arabic but can only seem to answer in french though they encounter many people on the road there's the scary old woman they pick up in the bosnian border on the way to belgrade and the talkative mustafa jacky nercessian who helps them out at the border of turkey the reticent and shy women wearing burqas on the way to damascus the focus is always on the mismatched father and son there is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes you see magnificent views in every city they go the director shows you even the blue mosque and the hagia sophia even though the movie is not relatively long br br generally i don't like movies which don't have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great despite some unanswered details like reda's unseen french girlfriend the movie appeals to senses great work of art and remember this movie is ismaÃ«l ferroukhi's debut
<START> this is one of the most god awful movies ever shaq better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny mst3000 would have a blast with this one
<START> dark rising is your typical bad obviously quickly produced horror sci fi fantasy movie it has a strange unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them most of the time i didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing there is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made like so many other bad movies give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on t v
<START> the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more 86 hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia action stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laugh out loud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chase's epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away br br realism is present when it is needed but chase's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chase along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i've seen on tv br br james gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect br br edie falco matches the power of gandolfini's performance as tony's wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tony's lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tony's cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television br br the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tony's overbearing mother livia an insight into tony's personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchand's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tony's protÃ©gÃ© whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christopher's girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher's career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that's just the tip of the iceberg br br familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are 50 great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show br br comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree with br br whether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you're thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit
<START> originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore 'not only but also' saw his ex 'beyond the fringe' collaborator peter cook guest on the first show and so well received was it the controller of b b c 2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on they were a classic comedy team cook was tall handsome and witty while dudley was short charismatic and musically gifted the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub wearing flat caps and mufflers fantasising about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time and even when cook corpses it still holds together well br br those characters idiot pete and even bigger idiot dud found their way into every episode of the show proper seen in a different setting such as a zoo or an art gallery in the latter they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art that leonardo davinci cartoon i don't see the joke says dud pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits dud nearly chokes on his repast you really are enjoying those sandwiches ad libs cook the pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'monty python' br br as the show's popularity increased so did the quality of the guest stars peter sellers for instance and john lennon the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'deaf ted danoota me' 'one leg too few' had dud as 'george spigott' a name later re used in the film 'bedazzled' a one legged man who hops into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of 'tarzan' cook tries to let him down as best as he can i've nothing against your right leg he says the trouble is neither have you br br dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur streeb greebling cook who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater was planning on opening a restaurant called 'the frog the peach' another classic was 'the leaping nuns' also reused in 'bedazzled' but my all time favourite has to be 'superthunderstingcar' a wickedly funny and accurate parody of gerry and sylvia anderson's 'thunderbirds' pete and dud played all the roles with the latter making a fetching 'lady penelope' 'ludwig' had ludwig van beethoven as the star of a 'this is tom jones' style variety show 'the immortal bargo' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'emma bargo' in an unforgettable moment she drove through london bellowing through a loudhailer i want to be alone br br a season 3 feature was 'poets cornered' with the likes of ronnie barker spike milligan barry humphries willie rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank they each had to improvise the line of a poem and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff br br three seasons were made in all produced at different times by joe mcgrath dick clement and jimmy gilbert sadly very few editions survive to make matters worse the scripts were destroyed as well it beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen br br the show ended in 1970 the comics then hit broadway made the infamous 'derek clive' tapes but cook's ever increasing alcoholism broke them apart eight years later cook announced that a new series was in the offing but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part his ex partner was making films in america and had no intention of working with cook again not at that time anyway br br enough footage was scraped together for a season of b b c 2 repeats in the early '90's as expected some items had not held up as well as others cook died in 1995 and by way of a tribute the b b c put together a programme compiled from various 'parkinson' interviews and 'not only but also' shows it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven bloody hell exclaimed the latter moore passed on in 2002
