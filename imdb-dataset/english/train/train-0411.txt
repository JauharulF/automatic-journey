<START> the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over rated 42nd street this is the definitive 30's musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced a must see
<START> imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film br br i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times the story itself isn't too bad it's just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about br br if you don't like america you won't like this film
<START> more like psychological analysis of movies but psycho does sound better as a header the man in charge of the movie the narrator if you will does depict movies here in his own way most of them are classics but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them especially the hitchcock movies solyaris conversation and the lynch movies because slavoj zizek will reference them br br or in other words he might spoil them for you i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed i think the chaplin movies too but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand in the imdb listing there is a movie missing that i did report to them so it might get up there pretty soon it's a meg ryan movie but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways br br zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you're open minded to see things through another perspective even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you it doesn't mean it will do that but it could
<START> of all the movies i have seen and that's most of them this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u s naval airships blimps during the ww ii era yes there are other good lta related movies but most use special effects more than any real time shots this man's navy has considerably more real time footage of blimps etc true lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies even today p s i spent 10 years out of 20 and have over 5 000 hours in navy airships of all types from 1949 through 1959 proud member of the naval airship association etc atc la ac usn retired
<START> michael bennett and nicholas dante's broadway show ran for years but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation which most likely stems from the choice of director richard attenborough as far from b way as you could get and lead actor michael douglas who plays a director choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer the slim story about a grueling audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor dancer singers is pushed right up on us with loud brassy talents playing to the rafters nothing is modulated or subtle particularly a laughable subplot about a ex dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old flame douglas the over eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing this matched with attenborough's sluggish pacing spells disaster and even the now famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping 1 2 from
<START> if you're as huge of a fan of an author as i am of jim thompson it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted to film this is not the case with scott foley's rendition of after dark my sweet a suspenseful sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and does great justice to the original text jason patrick and rachel ward give possibly the best performances of their careers and the always phenomenal bruce dern might have even toped him self with this one like thompson's book this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far at hand a must see for all fans of great noir film
<START> not only did they get the characters all wrong not only do the voices suck not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends not only are the drawings really crude but it seems like it was mainly created for ages 1 6 the only episode i've ever seen of this show that kept me watching was a mattter of family because i liked the robin character and sometimes i think it's just a general copy of batman the animated series example in btas bruce is friends with harvey dent yeah over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain twoface in the show bruce is friends with that ethan guy and over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain clayface that was just a small example that may not even be true but in short this is the worst attempt on a batman series and that's saying something
<START> this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to see br br i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish br br the story is simple enough terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium but it's actually carrying a bunch of man eating dinosaurs easy mistake to make cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts they are led by colonel rance played by scott valentine a man who seems to have perfected 'smell the fart' acting as advocated by joey in friends br br there's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting but unfortunately rance's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant lumbering monsters also the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks preumably so we can't see how bad the creature effects are br br having said all that we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next br br as a jusassic park aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's crotch but as ludicrous tongue in cheek entertainment it's a roaring success
<START> orson welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his i see lady of shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces the magnificent ambersons touch of evil the trial and chimes at midnight the plot can tend to be confusing sometimes and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly it doesn't matter however you can't watch welles' films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot his direction defines what great direction is almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed check out the courtroom scene usually they are such stock scenes that i can't stand them case in point try to sit through welles' own speech near the end of compulsion in lady from shanghai just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings or just take a look at the lighting in that scene i know it is just a simple venetian blind and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era but welles gives it a beauty all its own the dialogue is also remarkable welles had the skill a skill that no one else seemed to have to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry whether he was speaking shakespeare or spitting out hard boiled lines it had the power to stir the soul 10 10
<START> city hall is a somewhat mixed bag part vignettes of nyc political life and part moralizing tale al pacino a dukakis esque boss with presidential dreams gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance there's a couple times when he chews the scenery and in the case of city hall this is where he shines john cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without going into caricature of a new orleans dialect or sliding into melodrama during the films climax danny aiello as a burrough political chief is also very good i love showtunes too br br the major problem with city hall and it is a good movie in many ways is the general feeling of a lack of momentum it comes off more like a documentary than a motion picture we see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and naturally the viewer doesn't become involved when the viewer doesn't get involved to a certain degree they become apathetic towards the characters and eventually the plot br br this tends to alienate and what should have been a riveting detail divulging finale came off as a hmmm uh okay they say you can't fight city hall as the tread worn cliche goes yet it still can't stop you from thinking what might have been if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie
<START> after reading the other tepid reviews and comments i felt i had to come to bat for this movie br br roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark br br what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith the only other film like it in terms of its religious message would have to be tolkin's the rapture ' br br i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural it is a simple movie about catholic faith miracles and redemption though you would never guess it till the end it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns literally on a pun br br as a happily fallen catholic myself i know what the movie is about and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based then it will go right over you head br br as a film as opposed to a story cold heaven' it is not ground breaking while the rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery cold heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities there are no striking shots no edgy effects no attempts to fit the content to the form it is workmanlike shooting but subdued nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama it is a simple story that unfolds simply it may seem odd but at the end the mystery is revealed it looks ambiguous but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma br br in this regard cold heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like the sting ' or the sixth sense ' or final descent ' or polanski's a pure formality ' all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves they may frustrate you along the way but they have a point an obvious one indeed but the fun is at least in part in having been taken in br br still even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line it is worth watching for way it directs and misdirects you try it especially if you are or have ever been a catholic
<START> i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto rican when i heard it was rosie perez i wondered could she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto rican as far as i knew she was a nuyorican well anyway i anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch i realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right rosie perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto rican this documentary is more a 1st hand very very personal account on what it is like to be a nuyorican and all of what that entails she like most of the nuyoricans i know have a watered down partial and sometimes twisted sense of history how could they not they live here yes all of them are proud as they should be but a lot don't know the ins and outs of the real culture history and political background or language for the most part it all became very very apparent with her participation in the vieques issue regardless of my personal take is on this issue at least i know what the hell the fight is for there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about and only participated in because it was a puerto rican cause i really don't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it for those of you that are not puerto rican please view this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self discovery and acceptance do not take this as gospel a lot of it isn't even true please consider the source rosie is an actress not a historian this movie is not and should never be for other nuyoricans the base for their information instead just a step towards finding more info learning and debating what the reality is not just the one coming from this woman's eyes
<START> gorgeous techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a trappist monk who has left his monastery breaking his vows the film opens at a convent in europe where a former student prays a lonely beauty in black named domini marlene dietrich she is advised by the mother superior to go to the desert and find herself and lose her grief over her father who has recently died in the train car on the way into the sahara she sits opposite a very very troubled man charles boyer our former monk she's soon at a hotel near a palm treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl domini becomes friends with him though knows nothing of his past romance soon to follow br br this film is sentimental melodramatic and different in a way almost surreal and even a bit campy i found it to be quite fun and entertaining the photography in this is really interesting it is full of extreme facial close ups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert silhouetted figures against a sunset sky marlene dietrich gives a nicely done though restrained performance here and looks gorgeous charles boyer not usually one of my favorites is actually pretty good in this i think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too basil rathbone is fine here except given very little to do another great orchestral score by max steiner helps keep the drama rolling all in all a very enjoyable film
<START> well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and sandy gives a tour de force performance alas her career never quite took off but at last she will always be remembered for her three first rate pictures the king of comedy dallas doll and without you i'm nothing she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually is really pretty watch this one if you're not from iowa you'll certainly enjoy it
<START> by god it's been a long time since i saw this probably about 18 years ago br br the movie tells us kids all about human blood and the circulatory system very professionally put together disney style animation plus human actors it was directed by frank capra for pete's sake br br kind of an overkill i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film strip's worth of information on the human body but boy will those kids watching it learn even now i can clearly remember dr baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the doctor immediately answers sea water
<START> this highly underrated film is to me what good writing in a movie should be all about kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at the movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life br br along the way we are asked question after question about life davis steve martin with a great beard asks himself 'is my making a violent movie and by extension our enjoyment of it causing the violence in society ' claire asks what kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life ' mack is not immune as he asks 'is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and an even harder step finance these are of course not quoted from the film but generalities others ask their questions too and to be honest it raises more than it answers br br but that is the nature of life we strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires as humans we thrive on questions we cannot answer some answers are real claire and mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands some answers are not davis sees the light' and decides not to make violent films but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art br br we all seek answers this movie does not answer them for it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers br br
<START> for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film also the effects can be impressionable and awesome the plot is ridiculous and refreshing not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days br br also notable are the little aliens who i found cute all in all it's a good film for fans of the genre also recommended are films such as tetsuo the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed of course seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two
<START> whatever his name is the writer and director should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time sometimes movies are bad in a way that they're actually sort of good not this one this was so bad i got angry seriously a drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script what a waste all the actors were completely uninspired to work at all the cgi was barely acceptable the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was it's like he just decided i want this to happen and this to happen but i don't care how we got there just shoot it and put it in whatever i'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose if anyone calls for me i'm not here shame on you whatever your name is shame on you
<START> war is hell but this documentary of wwii is heaven br br not only is this series a breath taking almost exhaustive look at the second world war it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier br br this documentary series defines the genre it's sweepingly long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year br br truly this is an impeccable bit of film making other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper br br i'm going to go watch it right now again my 11th time
<START> jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy but hoffman's performance though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies as a portrayal of a new york character only daniel day lewis' portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable and day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso br br it's typical of hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight i think hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels br br voight's buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether except that ratso pulls him down pulls him down but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and more importantly how to live br br midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself i think that as gritty a movie as it is it has a very beautiful message that no matter how much a loser you might be ratso clearly defines loser if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in possession of the secret of life and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else br br i can't help but compare midnight cowboy to klute from a few years later which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape
