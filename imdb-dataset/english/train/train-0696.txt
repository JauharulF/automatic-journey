<START> i too was intrigued by the high 8 5 rating for this film and was very disappointed i had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row but it was not to be i went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way there is not much of a plot if any i don't necessarily need that in a movie but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in the best i could say would be that it aspires to be an altman esque film albeit with an extremely small ensemble sure there are moments but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing i do not understand the high rating for this film i give it a 3 br br
<START> if you're a fan of gothic horror then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian 60's film castle of blood we're really talking about creepily creaking doors eerie portraits that appear to be moving spontaneously dying candles although there's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors speaking in terms of atmosphere and style this masterful piece of gothic film making is one of the best out there just one tiny league below landmarks such as black sunday the three faces of fear and curse of the crying woman the prominent directors duo sergio corbucci the great silence django and antonio margheriti cannibal apocalypse killer fish are successful in all areas including a powerful plot one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ultra sinister scenery and filming locations stylish black and white photography spine chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers barbara steele starlet of the aforementioned black sunday and italian goth muse number one shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she's literally surrounded by excellent co players one of them silvano tranquilli even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author edgar allan poe the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager if he Â alan foster Â would survive spending one night in the infamous blackwood castle he receives the astonishing reward of 10 and a newspaper interview with poe needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds even for somebody like alan foster who's a firm non believer in ghosts and vampires the night starts out great for him as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams but gradually he learns that blackwood castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity i don't know about you but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time co director antonio margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well because he remade it himself a couple of years later as web of the spider that movie had a handful of trumps like for example the casting of no less than klaus kinski in the role of edgar allan poe but in general this original is vastly superior castle of blood literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances watch it late at night preferably alone and in a candle lit room and you'll get an idea about the true definition of horror
<START> woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film this movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by woody harrelson played one of my favorite t v characters woody from cheers and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie but after seeing his acting performance i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend his acting was as dull and poor as the movie another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez i have liked movies with perez before but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines do the right thing but now in white men can't jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice so after seeing this film term used loosely and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i'm a white man and i'm getting ready to jump off a twenty story apartment building
<START> a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts i'd ever read would be a bold understatement yet i never told him this why because in a world where films like while she was out can be green lighted and attract an oscar winning star like kim basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell br br as so many other reviewers have pointed out while she was out is a dreadfully under written woman in peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on christmas eve every gripe is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw dropping lapses of logic but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise here are a couple of things that struck me br br 1 i don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house is a mess with toys since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves br br 2 racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen br br 3 sure the film is stupid but so are the countless thrillers i've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing helpless victims of male sadism stupid or not i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors br br 4 i loved the ending br br 5 though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase i really do think this film should be retitled the red toolbox of doom
<START> el mar directed by catalonian director agusti villarona and based on the novel by blai bonet offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countryside br br we first meet three boys that are playing happily not everything is what it seems the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their games br br when we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully their relationship will have devastating consequences br br roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution simon andreu is perfect as alcantara br br el mar is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
<START> i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing return to paradise which i found to be gritty i was so disappointed the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from return to paradise br br maybe i was expecting too much br br on the positive side danes beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles although i didnt like danes's character and first and found her very annoying br br i couldnt see anything realistic about the film it could of been done so much better for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror it was too cheery a movie to be realistic there could also of been more action and tension br br the best thing about this film is the tragic ending i couldnt of predicted that but by that time i really didnt care what happened to them br br 3 10
<START> i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's it recalled me also fugitive movies a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland however the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time as i see many people say that this is like a tv movie not exactly firstly there are much more better tv movies in this genre secondly tv movies might be very fun sometimes but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time it is not stylish at all visually and the most important the tone of the movie is unappealing this is not an action movie there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash also they are not big action scenes but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie the love affair between douglas and bassinger was very unnecessary besides the assassination plot to the president is the most clichÃ© story in this genre either but they insist on that and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be although douglas is very old now he has still potential for acting in an action thriller in the film michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones for example sutherland is a wrong choice either because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie eva longoria parker is a strange choice of course she is too passive or straight in this movie because she is a soap opera actress the movie was not fun even one second to me so i could not get over for a while
<START> this superior inferiority to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i can't believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed was everyone on drugs from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is
<START> i acquired this one of my all time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me away br br i am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the will you track it's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth this rates second best to quadrophenia which also starred phil daniels br br a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which i grew up the ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby br br i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing i can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alone br br hazel sorry to hear about your dad darling god bless you all xx
<START> i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans oh and it's from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies i liked host but not my absolute favorite some of my favorite sci fi fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste mirrormask stardust serenity gattaca willow matrix resident evil series lotr stargate dark city br br it wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great there are some holes in the story but didn't really matter i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters the korean legend was interesting the reincarnation stuff was different and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows ethan's behr hair looked so asian br br yes it could be better and i hope in the future that korea with its unusual quirky sense of life intense emotions and unexpected humor can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future
<START> this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen the fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse br br i had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before i started watching but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce elijah wood's character matt into the hooligan scene br br but the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before br br let's clear up a few things hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run of the mill league game they don't set out to kill each other they don't only wear stone island and others in the crowd hooligans or not do they most certainly don't when having taken exception to a new firm member trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash and i'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm although you can scratch what i said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist br br don't get me wrong i'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims but this is on a par with the firm for cluelessness br br i found it ironical that wood's american nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when this is part and parcel of the british hooligan scene the film chooses not to challenge wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke br br i could go on but i think i've made my point br br as for the plot it's highly unimaginative and i'm sure if i hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points and more made above then i would have guessed what was going on sooner than i did and believe me i was well in front br br i get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised br br if i'm right then the makers have failed completely it's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene and i can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies br br are there any good points maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed but i'm rarely impressed by slow mo action certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway br br there are some funny if unrealistic moments wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me but a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross br br if you're british avoid like the plague if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know if you're american you may enjoy it as it's clearly tailored to the market but no one can deny the plot is flimsy predictable and ultimately over the top
<START> a text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house but i think the more apt word is entropy good grief what slobs these two babes are br br george seymour cassell is alone in his san francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in tiburon while his wife and child are away in san diego two girls sondra locke as jackson and colleen camp as donna knock on his door asking directions well it's raining and they're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens and they're not sure of the address they're looking for and what with one thing and another george invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire all three of them wind up in george's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure triple exposure quadruple exposure and dodekakuple exposure they spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast but something has gotten slightly cockeyed because georgie's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and you eat like animals george exclaims and tells them to get out in his dreams br br now don't get me wrong sondra locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt blue eyes and colleen camp bounces around like a superball you gotta say they breed 'em mighty cute down there in shelbyville tennessee where locke comes from and they breed 'em with bodacious tushes too as we can't help but note after the first five or ten minutes br br but when the girls go berserk so does the movie the film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light the pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors they brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure they cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture they have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another licking food and then jumping each other's bones br br and georgie they first render georgie unconscious with mace which contains nothing that you can't find in that little red bottle of mcilheny's tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet tie him up pour flour and milk all over him subject him to a psychotic trial put him through one of those tolstoy type semi executions slap him around dress up in outlandish costumes then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper middle class home and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina br br as for the acting it's as if someone had told georgie first act polite to these girls then act panicked after you're tied up and to the girls first act shy unwilling to impose on anyone then act crazy and that's it br br the photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie i'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill it takes effort and talent to turn san francisco ugly the score gives us two leitmotivs georgie's is some pop tune with lyrics about being free and giving in jackson and donna's is a catchy rinky tink thing called my good old dad br br i approve of the moral lesson behind the story though there are some things you should simply not give in to even though they might look like a lot of fun at first all very educational
<START> this comment does contain spoilers br br there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma panache and swagger it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good bye to andy garcia in ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and incendiary all at the same time br br washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very reservedly by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role br br it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be elevated to icon status br br the story has creasy really taking to pita and vis ca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them it is more of a kinship and a deep parental love seems to be present br br the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind br br also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film br br man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 10 10
<START> national lampoon was once a funny magazine whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke head days of the seventies when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth but everyone agrees that by the early eighties middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadn't and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin off records shot further holes in the hull outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence there's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug if you make it through the baffling opening segment 'growing myself' hoping things will get better tough luck they don't whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess if there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks the negatives of this rambling incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related items br br no wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivel br br how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on br br how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at that br br anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs
<START> there is only one problem with this website you can't give a negative rating additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie i say he was being too nice a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire this is absolutely terrible 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back after watching 5 minutes myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more he should go and buy a rope and to the actors in this flick i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence
<START> the leap years is a movie adapted from an e novella by singapore writer catherine lim which became the first singapore novel novella to be sold over the internet the film had a tortuous post production schedule shot in early 2005 it was slated for release at the end of 2005 but only turn up eventually 3 years later on the 29th february 2008 a leap year br br before i say anything i must first admit i'm no fan of the romance genre so i may be a little biased against this film i watched it merely because it was a singapore production and that it's available for borrowing at my neighborhood library here's my two cents on the movie br br let's just start by saying that other than qi yu wu's ks and wong li lin everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian the love interest is a eurasian ananda everingham and wong's trio of buddies are all er hem eurasians does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more in than the common chinese or whatever asian race you are i don't know it sure seems that way also everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical anglified accent which doesn't exist anywhere certainly not in singapore it's the kind of semi perfect english that authorities would like us speak but which doesn't exist anywhere outside say the mtv channel the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted not helped by the lack of true blue singaporeans in the cast br br the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one liners after one liners after twenty minutes the wit of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichÃ©s br br i guess i didn't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable br br there are other incredulities in the film i can't for one believe that ks played by qi yu wu would fall for one of wong's girlfriends and the scene where the bridegroom says go before i change my mind has been used in a hundred east asian korean chinese hong kong taiwanese etc tv serials br br so 4 stars for this film the production value is fair and wong li lin tries her best but she's not helped by the script joan chen has a 15 minute bit part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot but hey her role is just cameo br br if you come across the leap years in the rental or library you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiosity's sake but otherwise for people who don't exactly enjoy the romance genre you can decide whether or not to give it a miss
<START> what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's 80's but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop
<START> the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written br br i first saw this movie back in 1978 79 when i first subscribed to cable in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri br br this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early 1980's i received a free month of the star channel with my new cable subscription the van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time br br i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flick along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties br br i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere 4 99 br br seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was is however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now 30 years later br br it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking weed and having sex in the back a fancy van often all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should be br br there isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van with shag carpet walls mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it to get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a preppy lesser attractive girl that he half ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier better off and the movie ends br br the movie does have it's funny moments but watching this movie 30 years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza parlors pinball arcades it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes i'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the backseat afterwords i also remember many of the songs in this move when they were new this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memories br br the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i don't young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the 70's self included wanting a pontiac trans am chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang but never a van this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one which just wasn't true of that era
<START> the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes br br the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience br br i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if you're bored and nothing else br br 4 10
