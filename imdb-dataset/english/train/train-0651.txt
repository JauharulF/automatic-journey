<START> the story of the boy thief of bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924 who starred douglas fairbanks in the first silent rendering of thief of bagdad to less imposing more recent attempts the best however remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects those effects still work their charm br br no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief abu john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier jaffar played by a sinister conrad veidt the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram br br ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent he and the boy abu suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work br br two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl lawrence w butler and tom howard howard incidentally did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry br br duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind still i don't think anyone under eight ought to see thief of bagdad br br this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present it was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them br br thief of bagdad is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases this is one of the best of its kind br br 9 10
<START> please don't waste your time this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker's dracula van helsing anne rice's vampire lestat rock music and silly biblical references and blade high tech toys i really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good but not this stinker not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kick ass metal some reported only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins avoid it like garlic and crucifixes
<START> this show is quick witted colorful dark yet fun hip and still somehow clean the cast including an awesome rotation of special guests i e molly shannon paul rubens the stapler guy from office space is electric it's got murder romance family and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony somehow you really connect with these characters the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me something of a skeptic if i do say so myself totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night i just re read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it it really is that good i just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so i thought i'd send off a flare of good will this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it do yourself a huge favor if you haven't already and enjoy this gem while it lasts ok so one more thing this show is clever what that means is that every armchair critic writer in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it defending themselves with an i could've written that type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room in other words the internet this is a general interest anonymous website before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet critics aren't commenting on give my fave' show a spin it's fun good unpretentious fun
<START> i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world i can't understand why some people say she's not boring maybe the one who said she's boring is because he she is boring she's a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume flowers churches problems etc when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing everything's great we have a very good actress wonderful for long time alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des rÃves and eric lartigau did a very good work br br ana
<START> this early sirk melodrama shot in black and white is a minor film yet showcases the flair of the german director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art set in the 1910's barbara stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small town husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage she never fulfilled her ambitions and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre a high school production that is back in her old town she once again comes up against small mindedness and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter bewildered and boring husband richard carlson and ex lover the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions with every frame carefully shot and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady it runs a crisp 76 minutes and that's just as well because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further
<START> when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it i would go sleep but this was pure crap i actually got up and walked out this was poorly script and put together i hated it also they should not have taken brendan frasier off he was much better this was not as good as i had expected considering that i really liked george of the jungle 1 and the graphics weren't as good as the first one for instance the bird and when ever he crashed in a tree i hope that the director of this takes heed and next movies he make he needs to reconsider horrible i really would like to give ursla a job well done as she made the movie worthwhile until i walked out overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10
<START> what boob at mgm thought it would be a good idea to place the studly clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker ironically enough another handsome future star cary grant also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the highly overrated she done him wrong i guess in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles but i still wonder who thought that salvation army guys are hot and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played a long time ago i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army the volunteers of america and i never saw any studly guys working there and that includes me unfortunately maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead br br so for the extremely curious this is a good film to look out for but for everyone else it's poor writing sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film
<START> japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence as they are running we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment the act of running is a metaphor for these down on their luck people's lives in some way what they're really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams running makes them all feel truly alive the big life altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big violent and so absurd that it's funny in a clever way one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu
<START> well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb do you get it this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies br br as most of them have given their comments i thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors though having read worst critics against this movie i thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick well it all started well with some ahem comedies then it all started going pathetic man you can believe your self you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless huh well how much can a person digest a sick all possessive witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing br br the next worst thing about the movie is the zombie hero yes as he looses his fiancÃ© he roams around like a goat with black marks under his eyes and with the hero's terribly stupid sister you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie
<START> okay i saw this movie as a child and really loved it my parents never purchased the movie for me but i think i'll go about and buy it now i'm a sucker for pre 2000 animated films anyway onto the actual review br br what i liked there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell one of the few i've seen in animated films character development existed it's easy to classify characters in this movie i e charlie is the selfish mutt itchy is cynical but believes charlie carface is obviously the relentless villain etc i also loved king gator's song i've always loved loud annoying flamboyant guys this song may have been random but it was so fun finally the detail of the animation was beautiful you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful br br what i did not like the actual portrayal of heaven the way charlie reacted to it no surprises whatsoever made it actually seem very boring he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end i remember a few lines of certain songs such as you can't keep a good dog down let's make music forever and welcome to being dead but i can't remember the majority of any of them the songs weren't that catchy to be honest whippet angel she's annoying and that neck augh br br what parents may not like a few very scary depending on the viewer images of hell are shown during the movie carface is quite threatening beer is also implied but not actually dubbed beer gambling is a key element in the movie the good guy dies br br overall i love this movie even if it is a bit forgettable at times the scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones this was created back in a time when producers and writers weren't afraid to give kids a little scare now and then nowadays this probably would have been rated pg kids under the age of 8 or easily disturbed kids should not watch this other than that i give it 9 10 br br happy viewing
<START> this film really tries to hard if your going to make a horror film at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer br br you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything br br what was the point of the movie where it's actually going and more importantly what the hell was going on br br why were they there and how does it tie into anything just another weak sci fi horror i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie either that or people have low horizons it's not worth your 2hrs at all br br i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary this film is about as low as when a stranger calls god that was lame too br br big tip if your gonna make a horror make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on so they have a hook into your story because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job it's just the poor writing
<START> why am i so convinced there's actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him mr bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child i am sure i've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier have i just imagined this
<START> to make up a movie going audience i'm certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here i can't credit it can't help but be suspicious for that matter of back alley payoffs to critics who are touting annette bening for an oscar the hole in the kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attributed to her scenery chewing she's a wonderful actress but this is an unfortunately unbalanced performance lacking that essential quality film actors must master of catching the cadence of the screenplay and maintaining it for the duration of the disjointed madness that is a film shoot br br i don't really want to blame miss bening or most of the other performers well gwyneth paltrow has no excuse for her muzzy work however because this is a horrendous adaptation a classic case of mistranslation i am prepared to assume i haven't read the book and don't think i will after this the script launches us into the middle muddle of unaccountable behaviour and extreme emotional angst spewing from mystifying characters who have developed relationships neither with us nor each other it quickly becomes a grotesquely excessive tsunami like assault that sullies characters and audience alike and left me like a survivor shaking my head at the detritus left at the end of each repetitive episode shock and awe would describe my reaction to frantic bi polar mood swings between ranting and oh so quiet sensitivity the latter telegraphed by one of the most irritating manipulative droning soundtracks i've heard that is when all this isn't being set to ludicrously incongruous toons period stuff ya know but chosen with an astounding disregard for the tone of the scenes br br how this fine cast got mixed up in this i don't know i can't believe they saw the screenplay before signing they certainly apply their skills with commitment i felt so sorry for the wonderful jill clayburgh saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying vainly to wrench something of significance from sketchy and clichÃ©d dialogue in contrast somehow alec baldwin rises above the material to deliver a consistent nuanced real performance can somebody give this man a lead role of substance please and how about rachel evan wood or joseph fiennes you'd think the industry could make better use of him and without appearing as hirsute as elliot gould in m a s h br br my vote a standup turd all right but no link with heaven
<START> the haunting if you have seen the original you know a great ghost story it's perfection on film it's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements it terrified people it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film so when the haunting was remade in 1999 a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction what why what theÂ but in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation i'm pretty cool with it this is definitely not the case this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no scaresÂ pfft pg 13 what where they thinking not much apparently br br when her mother dies and her sister evicts her nell receives a phone call telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david marrow at hill house a secluded manor upon arrival nell meets mr and mrs dudley a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark shortly thereafter two other participants in the study arrive wild theo and bad sleeper luke sanderson along with doctor marrow unknown to the participants doctor marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear each night the caretakers chain the gate outside hill house preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning when the caretakers open the lock there are no working telephones inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away doctor marrow revels the story of hill house the house was built by hugh crain crain built the house for his wife hoping to fill it with a large family full of children however all of crain's children died during birth crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished and crain became a recluse the first night theo and nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words welcome home eleanor and becomes extremely distraught setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by crain's cruelty she learns that crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him he then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence she also learns that crain had a second wife named carolyn of whom nell is descended everyone thinks she's crazy while nell is convinced this is where she belongs br br seriously i suggest you stay away from this film it's really stupid and pointless not to mention the actress the played nell lili taylor completely annoyed me her performance her look just everything about her don't get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again catherine zeta jones just didn't fit in her role as well and liam neeson a wonderful actor wasted talent once again the effects are way over the top and too computerized i just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud believe me if you are going to be afraid of something be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupidÂ oh this film is already hurting me just don't see it it's bad br br 1 10
<START> this movie is easily the worst of the series though new line might just be looking at sales they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3d ending it wasn't that the 3 d was good either because it was 50's 3d with the red and blue lenses anaglyph it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like beyond that this movie was so poorly done bad script bad characters bad acting worse directing this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a looney tunes episode br br seriously not for horror audience because it is corny and not scary and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted br br i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film
<START> if ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their paychecks without much conviction br br michael caine and his wife beverly johnson work for the united nations world health organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in east africa along comes peter ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a moslem slave dealer as johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well br br of course caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt the rest of the cast has such folks as william holden rex harrison omar sharif and indian film star kebir bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing br br usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery but ashanti doesn't even have that going for it br br what an incredible waste of time the aroma of tax write off is permeating the air
<START> the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all must be special effects rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother the three main leads confirm after har di jo pyar karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry apparently salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses rani's character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the end this kept from her and the rest of the family the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer
<START> i'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f u c k u p s it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already br br given all that i still could have sort of enjoyed it if only they hadn't included all the maudlin nauseating infuriating disneyesque sentimental crap which is so out of place anywhere but nowhere more than out in space where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death br br the crew as well as the real astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else it completely ruined any value the production may have had left br br i'm surprised nasa let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them if you haven't seen this yet save yourself the irritation watch apollo 13 again at least that tried to be sort of real
<START> nell shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the maxwell automobile's off road capabilities the plot of the movie is pretty simple nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block and needs inspiration so she goes to visit mexico to absorb the atmosphere there she meets the hero bert van tuyle a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse while nell is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness the hero needs to get to her quickly so he decides to drive there in his car this is where the film takes a weird twist bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable huge rocks small streams heavy brush scraggly tree stumps steep inclines etc etc for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles now mind you this isn't a modern day atv it's a 1920 maxwell automobile so it looks very out of place as an off road vehicle and it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters we get to see it stuck more than once in this film but the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit on horseback and at this point it became hysterically funny to me watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs the bandits should have had ample time to catch up but they never do even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night and in a silly climax the car climbs a mountainside and helps nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits br br after seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off road capabilities than hummers and bradley tanks combined watch this film just for laughs it's worth it just to see nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying you did your best brave little car
<START> absolute masterpiece of a film goodnight mr tom has swiftly become one of my favourite films of all time nobody should miss out on seeing this film it's just too good mr tom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man who becomes a soft father figure when william beech nick robinson is sent to him for evacuation almost like 'the town mouse and the country mouse' a truly heart wrenching film the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well the film was so excellently shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear and these emotions could turn on a six pence set in a time of turmoil during world war two this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside they are almost like different countries an absolute must see those who don't are missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film
