<START> this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990 the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy the muppet movie and the great muppet caper around the mid nineties as a kid but didn't see this third one the muppets take manhattan until april 2007 this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and 1996's muppet treasure island for the first time in many years this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much but if not it certainly didn't go too far downhill br br the muppets' stage musical manhattan melodies turns out to be a big hit on their college campus they are graduating from college so they will soon be leaving but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway after their arrival they begin searching for a producer but after many rejections they finally decide to part and go find jobs most of them leave town but kermit stays and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete the frog quickly befriends pete's daughter jenny an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom now with the help of jenny he doesn't know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him she begins to see kermit and jenny together and to her it looks like they're getting close which leads to jealousy br br when i saw this movie for the second time it looked disappointing at first it seemed a little rushed unfocused and maybe even forgettable around the beginning there are some funny bits during this part of the film such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus but for a little while the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors fortunately it wasn't long before that changed the film is entertaining for the most part with saying goodbye the poignant song the muppets sing as they part and a lot that happens after that the two funniest parts might be miss piggy's tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging but there were definitely many other times when i laughed such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears the muppets still have their charm and comical antics which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part as does the plot a simple but intriguing one for all ages there are some weaker moments such as the muppet babies sequence and juliana donald's performance as jenny is lacklustre but neither of these problems are too significant and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience br br i would say the muppet movie the film that started the franchise in 1979 is the best of the original trilogy and that seems to be the most popular opinion this third film is probably the weakest of the three but all of them are good unlike muppets from space the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson's sad passing at least the muppets take manhattan is still the muppets i won't go into details about what i think of the muppets' 1999 film released twenty years after their first one since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing and even though it does have some appeal i'm clearly not alone however every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it
<START> this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i don't like boxing at all it's barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other up br br nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as cus d'amato i don't know how reliable the flick is i haven't read books and books about boxing or tyson i don't know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining br br as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it's charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
<START> warning this review contains spoilers do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film br br with a cast like this you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into did they see the script and say hey close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can't fail ' unfortunately it does did they even think to check on the director's credentials i mean would you do a movie with the director of a movie called satan's cheerleaders ' greydon clark who would later go on to direct the infamous final justice ' made this it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer final justice' and completely miss out on the return ' br br the film is set in a small town in new mexico a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam er a spaceship appears and hovers over them in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film the ship spews some kind of red ink on them it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it so right away you are treated with cheese anyhow the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children elsewhere we see vincent schiavelli whom i find to be a terrific actor watch his scenes in ghost' for proof as they are outstanding who is playing a prospector or as i called him the miner 1949er he steps out of the cave he is in and he and his dog are inked by the ship twenty five years go by and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd who works with her father raymond burr in studying unusual weather phenomena or something like that shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town and she travels there to research it once she gets there the local ranchers harass her and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on and deputy jan michael vincent comes to her rescue from this point on the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty five years earlier while this boring mess is happening vincent schiavelli with his killer dog at his side is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick or treaters at halloween the kind that you shake to make them glow schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people it's the second worst effect in the movie every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is br br and what does all this lead up to it's hard to tell when the final confusing scene arrives see burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of calling card ' but none of it makes sense why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it i mean why doesn't he kill jan michael vincent after all he had twenty five years to do it and the aliens won't need him if shepherd is dead anyhow so why try to kill her speaking of the aliens it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent what is their goal why do they wait so long to intervene how could they be so sure shepherd would come back not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made the return' any more pleasant you would still have bad lines really bad acting particularly by shepherd cheesy effects and poor direction luckily the stars escaped from this movie cybill shepherd soon went on to star in moonlighting' with bruce willis jan michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b movies often in over the top parts raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films martin landau who played a kooky law enforcement officer quickly made the terrific alone in the dark' and the awful the being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to the return ' zantara's score 2 out of 10
<START> the script for this tv soap opera is so bad that even a hopkins at some point had to play like an undergrad drama student so as to bring some life in his script dead character i do not know whether this was the purpose of the director but hopkins' ciano reeked nothing but vanity fear and lack of self esteem the real ciano possibly was all that but then why make a movie about him mussolini was a bit more convincing and his long way down was as if closer to the truth edda mussolini was plain ridiculous not because of sarandon but because of the impotent script while she had to be the central character of this alleged familial drama watch it only if you enjoy venezuelan soap opera
<START> hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare's works branaugh is one heck of an actor his portrayal of this was just amazing his soliloquies were breathtaking for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest however i was engrossed in this particular piece i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder betrayal and deceit not to knock mel gibson's version but branaughs touches the whole work this leaves no stone unturned when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself um how you say two thumbs up
<START> in this swimming pool this pond there are water lilies and there are frogs frogs sit on water lilies the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship marie pauline acquart is a water lily a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine adele haenel a frog the captain of her team floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline but floraine has a secret the bombshell has a bombshell which naissance des pieuvres reveals to the audience visually before she confides in marie br br floraine has never gone as they say all the way with a boy br br at a party we see a double image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make up in a bathroom mirror lolita is a fata morgana marie gets to know floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking in the film's most startling scene the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation floraine wants boys to like her but she doesn't like boys seemingly but it's more important to the frog that she's popular when the water lily finally kisses the frog the frog remains a frog the frog can't transform into a water lily or a princess because the water lily lost the frog's respect after their lips unlock floraine tells marie see it's easy which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite of passage without any strings attached floraine's beauty is a burden she carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet br br the other water lily the other frog marie's best friend anne louise blachere and floraine's frustrated boy toy francois warren jacobs just like any water lily and frog have a parasitic relationship too while floraine uses marie for love francois uses anne for sex but that's life that's the treachery of growing up in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself at a mcdonalds the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow physical beauty is a currency marie gets to call the shots because anne although far from being ugly is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie's flat chest but the tadpole marie thinks she's better than anne better than a water lily points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat br br teenaged girls can be brutal to each other br br later in the final shot naissance des pieuvres suggests that marie has a double too and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near future if it not already has teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match
<START> police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself compared to other action films police story makes schwarzenegger and stallone look like beginners the stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb if new line cinema has any sense they would release this in theaters
<START> sorry but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas and santa does dad is peachy happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died all ends syrupy sweet br br but as a parent who recently watched my five year old lose his best canine friend it was a horror flick now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh br br shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility
<START> when philo vance edmund lowe is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later the woman in green in which sherlock holmes basil rathbone is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized br br happily both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes when will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives
<START> i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting through most of rankin's dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it i couldn't actually make it right to the end and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs about 1 3rd of the audience after the ragged plot woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear this film is all pose and no art all style and no substance it is weighed down by dreadful acting a genuinely dire script indifferent cinematography and student level production values how it got funded started and finished is a mystery to me i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release the proper critics would tear it apart a really bad film shockingly bad a really really really poor effort and that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new born kitten gets dropped into a deep fat fryer moment totally meaningless utterly lightweight poorly put together this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema
<START> i actually saw this movie at a theater as soon as i handed the cashier my money she said two words i had never heard at a theater before or since no refunds as soon as i heard those words i should have just waved bye bye to my cash and gone home but no foolishly i went in and watched the movie this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh not even once not even inadvertantly mostly we sat there in stunned silence every ten minutes or so someone would yell this movie sucks the audience would applaud enthusiastically then sit there in stunned bored silence for another ten minutes
<START> before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright from the annoying characters in this movie from the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy to the killer just running about without any notice and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction then just doesn't go anywhere but into a new direction and on and on br br the acting is great but the writing is horrible each character in each scene says or does something so unbelievable unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast extras are simply strange there are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time
<START> this low grade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release which is just as well since the end result was not anything particularly special if decently atmospheric at that for starters the plot is pretty weak Â even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood 1973 Âalbeit without any of that film's campy gusto what we have here in fact is a penniless sculptor martin kosleck Â whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat Â who upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan napier's vitriolic pen one time too many decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river however while contemplating just that action he is anticipated by rondo hatton's escaped killer dubbed the creeper and naturally enough saves the poor guy's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york all we really see at work is kosleck and commercial painter robert lowery who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl joan shawlee over and over in banal poses Â how is that for art who conveniently enough is engaged to a rival art critic virginia grey of napier's before long the latter is discovered with his spine broken and lowery is suspected but then investigating detective bill goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of lowery's work i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be in the meantime kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting hatton's uniquely craggy Â and recognizable Â visage which needless to say attracts the attention of the constantly visiting grey we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column Âmuch to the chagrin of both artist and model bafflingly although the creeper is fully aware of how grey looks thanks to her aforementioned haunting of kosleck's flea bitten pad he bumps off shawlee Â who had by then become goodwin's girl Â in lowery's apartment and overhearing kosleck talking to you guessed it grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police sends the slow witted giant off his deep endÂeven down to destroying his own now completed stony image curiously enough although this was hatton's penultimate film his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet introducing
<START> hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this although i think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which i have mentioned blows br br this was made in the mid 80's and is horrible in the music score department it's funny to see oprah as a latter day crack whore type br br the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator pure classic cinema first off i don't care how drunk you are you will react to 1200f degree flame no matter how bad your acting but they really milked that scene it was comical i'll tell you what though i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death she annoys me
<START> any movie in which brooke shields out acts a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror shields actually is only bad because she's youthful inexperienced and clearly not well directed by her co star peter fonda is bad because well because he's bad i liked him in ulee's gold years later but lord above he's awful here not that anyone else is good there's not a single performance outside henry fonda's delightful cameo that is even passable i've never seen a movie with this many bad performances in the case of luke askew the chief villain it's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction as he's done good work in the past but his partner played by ted markland is an embarrassing ham the writing is just bloody awful and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say but they say them so badly the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized this picture was far worse than i'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten and probably never even made without the participation of a couple of famous names one bright spot the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big screen imax productions have not quite done so well and finally either this is a bad version of paper moon with a lovable pair of father daughter types or it's a bad version of pretty baby with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty something and a 13 year old it suggests more of the latter than the former and thus is pretty disturbing
<START> kubrick meets king it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 i remember then the movie came out and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since br br the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it the kubrick cultists don't give a damn about king's story they talk about steadicams tracking shots camera angles this is a film they insist it should be considered on its own as it happens both camps are correct unfortunately br br if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel the shining is indeed a failure a wasted opportunity a series of botched narrative gambits br br i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter the writer diane johnson author of le marriage l'affaire le divorce etc has a reputation as an novelist of social manners maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics but the little blue collar town of sidewinder colorado doesn't exist on any map in her francophile universe br br kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial however he of course is the real auteur and considered on its own merits his screenplay for the shining with its mishmash of abnormal psychology rationalism supernaturalism and implied reincarnation just doesn't stand up to logical analysis br br i'm willing to consider kubrick's shining on its own terms i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie but it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation alienation and madness either parsed either way the film pretty much falls apart br br are the horrors of the overlook hotel real or do they exist only in the mind first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance then as the hallucinations of his father one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror one notes how the hotel's frozen topiary hedge maze appears to symbolize jack's stunted convoluted psyche very deep stuff br br but if indeed the overlook's ghosts are purely manifestations of jack torrance's growing insanity then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead bolted walk in closet so that he can go on his climactic ax wielding rampage br br and can anyone explain with a straight face that black and white photograph helpfully labelled 1921 of nicholson as a tuxedoed party goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance's bad craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience and if you swallow that since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves br br maybe kubrick didn't care about his storyline maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror whatever the case the film tries to hedge its narrative bets to have it both ways rational and supernatural as a result the story is a mess this movie hasn't improved with age and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings br br i don't deny that a few moments of fear claustrophobia and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long long film but those gushing elevators o' blood seen repeatedly in little danny's visions are absurd and laughable and jack torrance's infamous tag lines wendy i'm home and heeeeeere's johnny merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief whew glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously finally kubrick is completely at sea or else utterly cynical during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son a foyer full of mummified guests all sitting there dead in their party hats yikes now i really am afraid br br given jack nicholson's brilliance over the years one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball rolling eyebrow wiggling scenery chomping performance that the director wanted the performance of shelley duvall as a sort of female version of don knotts in the ghost and mr chicken is best passed over in silence br br this movie simply doesn't succeed not as an adaptation not on its own terms it probably merits a 3 out of 10 but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over rated in this forum
<START> wow i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie br br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk another great lillard film br br baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to craziness also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d'onofrio a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene br br it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film br br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies critic's probably won't like this movie but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway
<START> i admit i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about 30 minutes nothing was happening and everyone has already described the plot but has anyone mentioned the opening scene a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard i'm guessing the bratty kid did it put it's never explained really trippy opening br br i wish this had been a better written or thought out film because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a clever movie it's just a poorly executed film br br i would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage i would like to see if it would help otherwise this is an odd little film that is best if fast forwarded through
<START> i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see it's great
<START> without question this film has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history i have it watched too many times to remember and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time br br where does one begin br br meena kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar each movement and nuance of her performance makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen br br pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition the photography sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left breathless br br naushads music is unsurpassed his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable br br my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should watch this epic mediation on life and art
