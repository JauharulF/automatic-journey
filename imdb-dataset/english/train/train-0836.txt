<START> a sad sad sight indeed is the munster's revenge the munsters are brought back one last time fred gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of herman munster in this made for tv movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and herman that are robots terrorizing the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy's stash at an exhibit with the police on their heels the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names we get to see them dress in drag as waitresses a minor highpoint in the film grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times one time even flying to transylvania with herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles i guess and a most annoying relative the phantom constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium what is most sad is hard to pinpoint is it that gywnne especially and al lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them maybe it is the ridiculous script sid caesar's crazy mostly unfunny antics or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super k mart fashion makeover at any even the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standards as for the rest of the cast yvonne de carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience k c martell makes an ever so not affable eddie munster jo mcdonell is an attractive marilyn bob hastings as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made for tv movie
<START> this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a brat as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something not all that good but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week
<START> a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night do not listen these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but they're also fun to watch in their simplicity they are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70's included low budgets all the time br br a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about at first the movie isn't all based around her until the rapture happens what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves no one can ever blame themselves because they're always right br br just like these whiners who complain about the movie these people must be full grown adults i'm thirteen and you don't see me whining especially since i was exactly like patty before i re accepted christ into my heart for those who haven't seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of stereo typical everyone else is wrong movies than you'll enjoy a thief in the night don't knock it before you try it something new is always good trust your own instincts
<START> i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record i'm not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really dug about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasn't a good time
<START> oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didn't they make it a real city the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list
<START> in her first nonaquatic role esther williams plays a school teacher who's the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool as the detective out to solve the case george nader gives perhaps his finest performance and he is so handsome it hurts john saxon is the student under suspicion and although he gets impressive billing in the credits it's edward andrews as his overly protective father who is the standout br br bathed in glorious technicolor the unguarded moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama
<START> this game ranks above all so far i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good the voice acting was above standard the difficulty level is just right wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting the only rating this game deserves is great
<START> a delight mini movie a musical short based on three of cole porter's broadway smash songs bob hope's first credited film is a delight he plays an american playboy millionaire on vacation in paris the film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door cafÃ© telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away suddenly he spots her a few yards away he is so over come his friends tease him and suggest just show her your bank book but hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with no money they bet polo ponies over the issue and take all his cash and id's hope follows her and when they are alone gushes out a proposal she does not believe he is sincere until he sings to her you do something to me by cole porter but she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue her but when she sees him showing another girl around town disillusioned she wants to drop him he continues to chase her and catches up to her and her family at a race track where he bets his meager earnings on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor so he wins the girl the race and the bet and sings two more songs
<START> this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth's societies prospered and others did not the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion highly recommended viewing
<START> this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to it's expectations the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the asian directors but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid explainable interesting angle basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases the acting was very good however all the actors gave good performances and jude law was outstanding as he is always is it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film
<START> i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months i was actually surprised at how good it was br br the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned br br a few years later the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party though not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party br br later through the film the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well br br at the end of the film you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened but marty is in the hospital with severe burns although the murders didn't happen the burns and the pranks apparently did happen br br the acting is terrible but that is fine br br i love the story i really sympathize with marty it's like tamara 2005 the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge br br i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers br br i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 good cheesy slasher
<START> this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the 'noise' and yet that's all it has some 'sense' of a broadway without the bang br br the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical br br disappointing sinatra br br intolerable sinatra's fiancÃ© surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary br br tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice br br delight brando's understated singing very biased br br surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes it's the bone structure how i would've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again
<START> the most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever let's forget that in order to become a saint the saint must be dead and saints don't have significant others that for a millennium nick has been the jolly elf to fred's scrooge is never even hinted at open on nick learning how to make toys then on fred learning how to run numbers nick giving a sick child a dolly fred repossessing the dolly along with the family farm after a few more such episodes morph to present day fred venting his spleen at siblings anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy there i just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy br br this santa who is one ho ho ho ho ho away from a massive coronary is a neurotic wuss saddled with the queen of the harpies an operation straight out of mega mall hell and answers to a board huh which just gave the easter bunny his pink egg oh and his right hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin tight mini dress and go go boots ho ho ho ho ho br br but what really sent me over the edge was slam being named 1 on the naughty list shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for the future hitlers and stalins children who are the true embodiments of evil nope to old sausage fingers a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the demon seed br br the nimrods behind fred claus should be boiled in their own pudding bah
<START> i thought this movie was very well done taking place in the mid 1950's everything looked accurate to me it was well cast and believable i don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a classic if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it
<START> ok this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way though it was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies i've seen the jokes and gags are purposefully bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre there is a pretty weak plot but it works just fine br br elvira's character is the focus here she is lovable and adorable cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly stunning few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie br br i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last br br highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of beautiful women i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies
<START> this is my favorite all time movie it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single i first saw this movie with my aunt brend and sister chasity i was in the 2nd grade i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend i've read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy how sissy has to learn to act married but let's go back and look at this for a second spoiler my interpretation of the movie now not when i was eight is this about bud sissy's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at gilley's riding the bull they get in a huge fight bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and wes asks her if she needs any help they're all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam when are you going to take me home and rape me pam answers when ever you're ready cowboy bud then goes home with pam to her condo in downtown houston which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and all that that implies bud is the one who cheats on sissy sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day sissy is the one who leaves bud then it's up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real cowboy and win her back br br anyways that's my interpretation everyone has their i'm sure i love this movie br br and believe it or not i got myself a real cowboy i love him too
<START> what an insult to olivia d'abo who plays the film's heroine robin to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film and at least on recent reissues to have only reeves appear on the box considering that she was the star i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long forgotten after school special but at least give the woman some credit br br despite that this has to be one of the worst teen sports themed films that i have ever seen and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clichÃ© from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance and in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembello's notable 'maniac' which was made famous by flashdance or was it the other way around it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance offs between the heroine and her antagonist s the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team we saw this in trashin' a vert ramp joust and rad bmx dancing at the prom although it wasn't much for competition but rather for fun for example in fact this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness such as the somewhat homo erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team br br nonetheless the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible she lives with her ailing mother her obnoxious sister and her careless and slightly abusive stepfather needless to say homelife is not so appealing add to the mix a talent for gymnastics but several obstacles to joining the team including the nuisance of her arrogant snobby teammates and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well and of course we can't forget that she's got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates nor that she doesn't have a steady boyfriend although keanu as tommy later enters the picture could this kid be any more pathetic and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long redundant and clichÃ©d quest to prove her worth to everyone br br but even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance off to scold the teammates it makes episodes of 'amazing stories' look like shakespeare br br i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor for that you might be satisfied but it is also an incredibly forced drama so caveat emptour
<START> one of the ten best comedies ever br br this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings keaton's comedies are innerly harmoniously intelligently ordered thought br br wonderfully amusing deliberately delightful and inventive three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one a threefold love story will enchant the viewers i want to bring here this approachÂkeaton's comedy is like lang's destiny upsideÂdownÂor Ã rebours again a couple traverses the waters of timeÂand of epochsÂin the stone age in rome and in keaton's timesÂin a mohammedan country in renaissance italy and in china the same device works in the both moviesÂone a grim eerie melodrama the other a light virtuouslyÂpaced comedy at keaton it's essentially the same couple and maybe the same is with lang the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice i have found three ages well written and smart without being ostentatiously sophisticated the plot is basically very popeyeÂlikeÂthe babe is a piece of furniture the only protagonists are the two male rivalsÂkeaton and beery br br keaton's movie is simply enormously likable and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funÂyet it's not but it is grand fun large fun ample fun and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis
<START> being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of edward d wood jr i purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant ed wood actually was br br what i got was a disappointing self centered conflictive contradictory compilation of bitter self aggrandizing has beens br br where people do remember ed wood jr do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in plan nine from outer space br br it appears as though the very minute there is a renewed interest in ed wood these people come out of the wood work only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else would after 50 years i would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the 75 they were promised br br ed wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain in fact that was all he lived for you may giggle when you see ed's films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing with him and not at him br br but i digress back to the film at hand if you are expecting a film about edward d wood jr you won't get it here if you want a film about cranky bitter old actors this is the film for you
<START> salvage 4 out of 10 groundhog day meets a christian coalition horror film okay maybe it's not that bad but it is close br br claire played by alicia silverstonesque lauren currie lewis is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer chris ferry who is quite menacing and brutal i say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dreamÂ or was it cue music br br the basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot done quite well the first time is repeated over and over again and since claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality i just stopped caring what happened to claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together br br i was rooting for a sÃ©ance which honestly would have made more sense but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings think the village or below yup the film collapses faster than donnie darko's directors cut all the great twist endings in horror movies the sixth sense the original invasion of the body snatchers happy birthday to me worked because the audience wasn't expecting a left field explanation heck even the canoe ending in the original friday the 13th was worth a jolt br br salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack though the featured songs were decent the obvious time padding claire doing the dishes claire's mother's subplots the way claire says hello is anyone there every time she thinks there is a serial killer around br br also some of the secondary acting roles in particular claire's mother played by maureen olander who resembles a mary kay zombie shows the first time actor low budget roots br br both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess problem is they really don't
