<START> sure this was a remake of a 70's film but it had the suspense and action of a current film say breakdown he's running desperate to be with his hospitalized wife the police are the least concern the chases were very good the part with him being br br cornered at a rest stop was well done the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger this is better than bullitt a boring movie with what a muscle car chase that was filmed badly vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law few movies had the effects night vision cb radio okay i forgot the name of the movie guy has 76'caddy souped up toys with guy he upset the ending is great you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not a very good did he make it or not
<START> oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didn't anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us australians new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i don't even normally write reviews on here but in this case i'll make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
<START> i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes with his film 500 years later it is a african issue but the idea doesn't fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing it is really a art house gem

<START> i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick the people involved should be ashamed
<START> at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between 'demons' bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse br br be prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
<START> style but no substance not as funny as it should be not as deep as it wants to be br br this is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking a young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci fi movie called codename dragonfly think barbarella or danger diabolique br br but jeremy davies is an angst ridden filmmaker he's no hack he's an artist the movie he wants to make is a diary of his life hardly original br br all the characters outside of jeremy davies filmmaker are as thin as rice paper characters that might be interesting such as his father his doppelganger or jason schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing br br this movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as stardust memories or 8 1 2 it pales in comparison those movies are funny provocative with well developed characters those movies have lessons that apply outside br br the movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene the filmmakers describe it as a send up but what's the satirical target the actors say it's an homage but i think i would rather a full length version of codename dragonfly br br coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci fi movie within a movie but he fails to share why we should be amused br br outside of the sci fi movie its just a mess there are continuity errors the filmmaker chooses a sci fi weapon after its already been chosen what br br just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story lack of a point a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms br br i guess if your roman coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing in that sense it may be considered autobiograhical br br i would watch it at circuit city on a wall full of tvs if i had a choice watch the 15 minute codename dragonfly movies included on the dvd as extras and then send it back
<START> ben arthur could have been a 10 sam mraovich wrote directed stared and produced this movie sam should have given his idea to a good writer director and left the acting to somebody who could act this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production there was nobody to tell him sam this is bad really bad br br jamie brett gabel's acting was the only good point but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with br br this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie twice the acting and direction was so bad this movie was turned into a comedy you just had to laugh and in the wrong places br br a second good point this would make a great date movie after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date
<START> this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid it's no citizen kane but it has its moments the arm ripping scene is good the plot is good even if characters aren't could have something to do with the acting put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get this was one of those shoot edit what little there was and distribute in a couple of months type of movies this is classic low budget sci fi and deserves it just due i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age
<START> for such films like anchors aweigh' few have been bestowed with as many academy award accolades in a warm up for happy hour either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by billy wilder's the lost weekend' that they wrote anything starting with a on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public since gene kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in singin' in the rain' then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at mgm of course the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of hollywood itself handy for those stuck on the other side of the world br br yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of gene and frank sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime there have been many longer pieces before and since but in this case all of the charming kathryn grayson's scenes could have been eliminated until the viewing of kiss me kate' it may have been necessary non opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand br br if there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's on the town' then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with jose iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted susie' rendition few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of mgm then few are even luckier to be attended to there are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of susan abbot or kathryn grayson but it makes the continual non opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both br br but for all the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale makes anchors' at least doesn't question picking the wrong mgm film the direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography whenever anyone bursts into music or song the film makes for a joyous occasion br br the natural highlight of the film is gene kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland climaxing in a brilliant dance with jerry the mouse this is a well deserved masterpiece number of kelly's career and it's nice to know he thought of it before fred astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings br br it's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour rainbow sprinkled chocolate wafer cream and cherry and banana split sundae but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt is still a pleasant feeling br br rating 7 10
<START> what a terrible movie the acting was bad the pacing was bad the cinematography was bad the directing was bad the special effects were bad you expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher but even the killings were bad br br first of all the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes i thought it would never end they could have removed 80 of it and explained what happened well enough br br then the victims were invited to the reunion in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on one of the victims thought this was a little odd but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway br br finally the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable br br there is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts at that this movie makes showgirls virtually indistinguishable from citizen kane
<START> contains spoilers br br timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king timon decides to go back before the beginning to when the story really began so they go back way back back even before simba was born back to timon's old home which was miles away from pride rock a clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas the worst digger in the clan was a pompous self centered meerkat named timon his mother took pity on him but uncle max just shook his head mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere just then hyenas shenzi bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max that did it the other meerkats just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off he didn't get very far before he started getting homesick just then he met rafiki who taught him to look beyond what he sees timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named pumbaa who was all alone due to a flatulence problem timon and pumbaa join up then but timon declared them acquaintances rather than friends br br they soon arrive at pride rock where all the zebras antelopes wildebeests rhinoceroses giraffe's elephants and many other plain animals had gathered what was going on timon didn't care they pressed on timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see just then all the animals took a bow was this to honor the birth of the new king no pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream when they reach land timon decides to give up but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise it was beautiful trees and water falls as far as the eye could see timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from rafiki hakuna matata timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into simba they take him under their wing and become father figures they teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests pretty soon a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest simba won leaving timon deathly ill br br then one day simba's childhood friend nala arrived timon and pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship suddenly simba runs away nala and pumbaa race after him but not timon he chose to stay at hakuna matata by himself until rafiki talked some sense into him so he joins his friends at pride rock timon's mother and uncle max arrive then while simba battles scar mother and max dig a large hole to trap hyenas shenzi bonzai and ed in it worked scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas then all is well mother uncle max and the rest of the meerkats go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is hakuna matata back to the present timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother uncle max simba and rafiki want to watch it again so do mickey mouse donald duck goofy snow white the seven dwarfs dumbo peter pan the lost boys mad hatter march hare genie aladdin and jasmine br br well i must say that the lion king 1 1 2 wasn't as good as i had hoped it was too ridiculous and silly the original lion king was a masterpiece it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in this one was just silly and made a mockery of it i swear sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed they're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny just annoying the original voice cast is back nathan lane as timon ernie sabella as pumbaa matthew broddrick as adult simba whoopi goldberg as shenzi cheech marin as bonzai jim cummings as ed robert guillame as rafiki new to the cast are julie kavner of tv's too long running series the simpsons as timon's mom and jerry stiller as uncle max so anyway this movie isn't the lion king iii and it isn't ii because there already is a ii it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away hence it's 1 1 2 in conclusion i don't recommend this to die hard lion king fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivilous however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them i hope this will also be the last lion king movie two is enough the lion king 1 1 2 what we've come to expect from disney sequel makers br br
<START> mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world renowned tenor whose name is known even today br br the film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if you're a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd even if caruso's wife dorothy just had a baby girl also it's highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for him br br in taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso's life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking machine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake br br instead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during l'elisir d'amore at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy caruso's biography of her husband that's what it was suggested what is true is that dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage and left her 1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 10 7 2007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy br br some people say that lanza's voice is remarkably like caruso's but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point caruso's voice is remarkably unlike lanza's in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself br br really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same
<START> this version of moby dick insults the audience by claiming it is based on melville's novel even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous call me ishmael in addition to having atrocious acting even from john barrymore this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood especially early hollywood would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office all of the novel's beautiful poetic language has been absolutely eradicated and ahab has been changed from a brooding blasphemous obsessive madman to a dashing misunderstood hero who only wants to kill moby dick after his fiance turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself and a different ending
<START> this film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre no jokes but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff the music and the girls are great unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them it was weak very very weak
<START> val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing
<START> a lot of other reviewers here including many whose opinions i respect hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard personally i didn't like it at all its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well unfortunately the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d'amato does not d'amato's most well known films are infamous for their high gross out quotient this an early film by him doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious anthropophagous and beyond the darkness did ultimately its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way without the sleaze factor either it becomes very boring as i said others have enjoyed this film but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing br br there are a few pluses for the film ewa aulin from candy is in it and she looks pretty hot and is often naked however cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film he seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore still this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring 3 10
<START> i enjoyed this movie granted it is mainly because i enjoy seeing sean connery act and this one has the added bonus of having ed harris and lawrence fishburne in it too the story has a grandma seeking out connery's assistance because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted at first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to coerce a confession out of the boy well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison one who is about to be put to death he is a particularly nasty person too as he takes a lot of joy in what he did writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them a lot of twists and turns in this one with some of it being somewhat unexpected me i just enjoyed sean connery's character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal the movie also made me mad in areas especially when you find out what ultimately happened you get very good interplay between connery and harris and connery and fishburne as they all shine rather well in this one in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense thriller
<START> this centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt br br merrill berates the distraught boy to stop his 'whining' about rennie's death old style real men in action here br br the crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen br br the storytelling itself despite the flashback sequences plays it straight all the narrators are trusted by us regardless of the 'truth' or 'untruth' of the dialogue so there's no game with the viewer about narrative structure this would become a rough template for future retellings such as fearless br br so all we're left with is individual performance and at that level it's best for wynn's bantering a virtual one man show
<START> this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie it's a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone
