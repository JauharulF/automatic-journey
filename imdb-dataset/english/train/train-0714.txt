<START> i know a lot of people don't like this movie but i just think it is adorable there's not much i can say but the movie is a feel good movie i guess the songs are beautiful the costumes are beautiful the voices are beautiful and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie especially as briggitta learns about the do's and don't's of society if you like musicals i'd say you'd like this one
<START> for anyone craving a remake of 1989's slaves of new york what are there seven of you here it is was br br this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters well they're club kids ya big jerk that are in holding patterns the big question seems to be just how long can a young adult remain juvenile it took three people to write this 'story' good god it was easier to come up with citizen kane rather than take viewers back this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene ster in the early 90s br br the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self absorbed twenty somethings could imagine it the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey's breakin 2 electric bugaloo her i'm serious about graduate school while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical posey's shtick is always amusing but there are projects that are beneath her i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark
<START> this film is absolutely hilarious basically the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b movie chemical accident he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic and this is clearly the intention its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film fantastic tacky fun
<START> if you get it it's magnificent br br if you don't it's decent br br please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificant br br above all it's a movie about acceptance both superficially of a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reason br br it's also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic ending br br above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema could not wait for it to end to make matters worse it is given a 12a certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot just bodies slumping to the ground even babban getting killed was cut out too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop disastrously amitabhs acting was great but that 'basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays devgans mate can't even act devgan was wasted br br i would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned
<START> the worst film ever made br br after watching this supposedly gay made film i suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture i had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so i had someone to scoff at when i paused the movie out of shock disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity br br on top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot its just a poorly made film a dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better br br seriously after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here i suspect the writer must have a half a dozen imdb accounts anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke is a liar or being paid heavily to say so
<START> may contain spoilers but doubt it can actually be spoilt br br five across the eyes can be summed up in one word amateurish this film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'blair witch' type of filming it doesn't work it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera a van and decided to make a movie the story has no explanation the protagonist is given no real motivation and looks like a lesbian wearing a power suit compared to the five girls and there is no violence to speak of just the sounds of screaming and crunching the whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question the five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually act they spend the whole movie screaming squealing and whimpering so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it this video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror that literally sums up the whole movie we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive with one minus a finger the only thumbs up get it finger lol is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices and their pride after making this terrible movie do not judge this by the poster you'll be very let down
<START> i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh ty rip off of dexter's laboratory and johnny quest 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my flippin' god their dad is a mother f kin' crazy home maker isn't that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would br br i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only 3 word count them 3 words to describe it br br Â· lame Â· stupid and above all Â· f k up that's all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev er if i had one that is
<START> after repeated listenings to the cd soundtrack i knew i wanted this film got it for christmas and i was amazed marc bolan had such charisma i can't describe it i'd heard about him in that way but didn't understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage he was incredible clips from the wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as marc bolan performs some acoustic versions of get it on etc i'm still learning the song titles george claydon the diminutive photographer from magical mystery tour plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it even though i put the spoilers disclaimer on this review so you would just need to see this for yourselves it evades description br br yes i love the beatles and was curious about ringo directing a rock documentary that was 35 years ago now i finally find out it's been on dvd for 2 years but it's finally in my home it's an amazing viewing experience even enthralling br br now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user br br there's two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release br br 1 from the menu on disc one select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2 on the extra scenes page goto scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3 when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star 1972 logo appears 4 press enter br br 5 from the main menu on disc two select the sound options 6 on the sound options page goto the 90 25 i think thats right option and keep pressing left 7 when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star home video logo appears 8 press enter
<START> the plot is real horrific the atmosphere really depressive unusual for a low budget production like that and at least for a german production a little bit of indian spirituality mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together the development of plot and characters are great the sets very close to reality without any studio atmosphere it could be perfect but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing what don't inevitably have to be typically for low budget movies br br 1 the cast sometimes is not more than average almost every actor look like a layman some of them do a good or a very good job but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court shows but i was very very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carriÃ¨re his acting in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine here was below average but that could be the reason why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tv series on private channels br br 2 the dialogs are sometimes on soap opera level br br 3 the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again it caused by the set big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors br br but all in all it is an interesting movie worth to watch it far beyond the commercially movies which are often more terrible
<START> james j corbett's autobiography the roar of the crowd was the starting point of this lively and well remembered fictionalized biography the author was heavyweight champion of the world succeeding john l sullivan before the turn of the century the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen time to prove his compeers were wrong he is an bank teller when the film opens but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well to do he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl with whom he always seems to be quarreling and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others when he defeats the club's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him he finally decides to become famous by fighting he sets out on the road with his friend who acts as manager and trainer and despite a few near setbacks he wins all his bouts and attracts attention coming home to pursue his girl again he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy mighty john l sullivan who enters bars and claims he can lick any man in the world few believe he can win a bout against sullivan but corbett dubbed gentleman jim for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving dancing out of range and negating the furious sullivan's power the film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett the new champion rises to the moment tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different and shows him nothing but admiration and respect he gets his girl as a result of his two performances but by the end of the film as they visit his s parents his manager is able to tell the world the corbetts are at it again the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel sidney hickox did the cinematography with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns the film was ably directed by action film specialist raoul walsh flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often michael curtiz among the cast were ward bond as john l sullivan in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett a young man he seemed to relish playing he later said it was his favorite role from the period jack carson was his manager alan hale his charismatic father john loder a rich foe with william frawley minor watson madeleine lebeau rhys williams arthur shields dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings it is hard to say enough about the logic and light hearted fun this movie's makers have generated it is one of the best liked of all sports biography films and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well
<START> i'm not even gonna waste time on this one it's not funny not scary practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory the fx suck though no pun intended this is a disclaimer watch at your peril ask yourself 1 question are slugs scary
<START> this movie is painfully slow and has no plot it conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job there may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light br br i do not understand why it had a 7 8 when i decided to watch it i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff no luck the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes anything above 6 5 was worth watching br br and my wife says javier barem does not even look good in this movie he's not my type so my agreement does not mean much br br sigh i give it a 1
<START> i really like this movie because in australia chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time i must say this is one of the best serious movies ever which outlines the difference between the hong kong people and mainland chinese it really shows that there's discomfort between the two but can only get better as hk are learning mandarin it also showed me how in mainland china the indie rock scene exists and that chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking whoever said china isn't ready for rock music daniel wu is absolutely superb with his clean and crisp voice honest acting and a total chick magnet i recommend this movie to those who don't know much about asian people to cleanse themselves from the typical western stereotypes and people who just love chinese asian cinema like myself check it out
<START> sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichÃ©s but it's entertaining and that's what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised as for michael vartan i'm sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see br br olivia d'abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if d'abo's british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadn't really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception br br it's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that's why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily don't get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those br br i give it 9 10 only because i'm saving my 10 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you'll like it
<START> spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe2 who said that i was young and that is true holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow hide daddy the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible my daughter julia is 23rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer she already said that she doesn't like bullies having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys julia has been growing up fast the time of jfk and qe2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023 julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also
<START> i don't know what you guys are inhaling but please stop this movie was complete trash br br macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable cute sweet loving and extremely fun to watch he had that innocence but at the same time he was strong as well br br this new kid alex annoying as all hell just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin's charm and grace failing miserably at that br br the villains complete crap harry and marv they were such an entertaining on screen team they were comedic they were humorous and just made you really want to root for culkin even more which is what a good villain is suppose to do these guys joe pesci and daniel stern absolutely perfect for those roles on the other hand in 3 we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining more on the corny side actually br br then we got the actual movies part 1 and 2 classics memorable perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions it makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters simply memorable and close to being masterpieces part 3 masterpiece of crap enough said br br all and all i don't know why people like this i think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore its a crappy sequel rip off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of br br run run away from this garbage and lets not even start with part 4
<START> i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie 1 but this movie was beyond terrible br br the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying usually when i watch scary movies i think it's dumb when the characters hears a noise in house forest school etc and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least they're believable when they do it this movie couldn't even get that right br br this is a movie that'll make other b horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces br br i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again it's awful
<START> this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero however due to far superior modern technology puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope br br i enjoyed this film but boy was it a chore at first unfortunately for most westerners this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd however give it a chance don't think or try to understand everything you see just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film br br in many ways this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai japanese mythical spirits the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live action and spirited away is much more child friendly while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie in the usa most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent scary and features some adult behaviors so who is the audience in the west well older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non western themes and composition this is a rather narrow audience indeed br br while you are watching look for all the strange little touches in fact you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera the scene that came with the comment kids don't try this at home as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai hmm perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning br br by the way director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed normal some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them especially audition and ichi the killer whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen the happiness of the katakuris one thing for sure it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other
<START> when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of 'must see' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come true br br of course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know it's something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something special br br most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach michael douglas richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job br br everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancersÂand it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go by br br like a movie i saw recently a prairie home companion the broadcast of a radio show atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesn't seem to stop again i don't if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesn't look like it and anyway it's a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the cameraÂwith only one setting ronnie taylor's cinematography finds the way making close ups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york br br in one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left before we start eliminating you're all terrific and i'd like to hire you all but i can't this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good it's hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrific br br to tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is 'a dream come true' the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman which is very touching at times so if it's not with a song it will be with a word but in a chorus line it's impossible not to be moved br br during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by alyson reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
