<START> this movie seems to send the wrong message there can be morality without using christ poeple of other religions i believe can get into heaven i am a catholic who goes to church every week but i do not agree with such christian arrogance this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen timeline
<START> this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen yes it's even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin costner br br chris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful stand up comedian but he just can't transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture br br if you haven't watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall br br for chris' efforts i give it a 2 10 br br
<START> well what can it be said about this disaster i watched it because it aired on cable i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money br br the creature is the cheesiest you can get please you need to be very generous not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume oh well there are also displays of horrible acting f x and dialogues the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable you can't get a more pathetic scene br br this is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks creature unknown makes full moon pictures movies look like halloween br br avoid this one at all costs please the only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women
<START> roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family br br this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better as much as i didn't like barracuda that's on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane br br eye candy one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker br br my grade f br br dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive in food and trailers for bonnie's kids features nudity the centerfold girls part time wife features nudity psychic killer eaten alive the dvd also comes with 1978's barracuda
<START> this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you haven't figured it out yet i didn't like it and if it wasn't for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post
<START> the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent the actors the voice overs the direction it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly i absolutely love this picture
<START> steve chris hoffman gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing while they are there a reptilian creature in the shape of a man reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one a biker ellen ripley type time female bad ass kat chase masterson has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage kat knows more than she's telling she also suffered the loss of a child but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of this creature might just be more human than they realize and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes' death kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin br br thankfully a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes the film has dawson's creek type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares the cast is rather life less and uninteresting pretty maggie grace the fog remake might be the only draw for this film
<START> this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent i've lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people don't have a southern accent here this movie is about a guy who does meth and i don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day the movie is just wrong in all directions i would suggest the basketball diaries if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs
<START> of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes it is about what cinema does best great camera work great settings and great performances br br the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last br br i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
<START> thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an inferiority complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd it's only 99p
<START> why panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen it's much too smart and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it comparing it to american beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis and sopranos and analyze this in it's study of illegal goings on amidst family life though panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material brommel's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man br br william h macy stars as alex a hitman who works for his father's sutherland contract killing business he leads a double life with his wife ullman and son unaware of his real trade in his middle age he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life under his calm collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father's controlling grasp on his life when he meets a young woman campbell he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business br br the fact that writer director henry brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract killing is disposable he could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession his characters are so well developed and believable scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on macy's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman brommel's script feels like a shakespearean tragedy with a definite theme of destiny running throughout br br in alex macy creates a tragic easily sympathetic character and turns in yet another brooding great performance as can always be expected donald sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father and ullman's dramatic turn as macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian consider a scene in a bicycle shop where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion br br henry brommel's first feature panic is a film that is well crafted in its sincerity with a first rate cast a plausible script terse dialogue and nice direction this character study is hopefully just a taste of brommel's aptness for creating characters that seem real br br 8 out of 10
<START> this makes the third errol morris movie i've seen and i'm increasingly not liking his style he seems to find very interesting and varied characters great personalities to create documentaries for and then with tongue in cheek editing make fun of everything they are about it's never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying but no no these people are really fascinating really but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not so subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back br br this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant like a lion tamer a man who keeps a garden full of animal shaped shrubbery and a robot designer the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal human and life features so the title of fast cheap out of control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie right except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions he might call them obsessions making synthetic designs on life i share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film br br but i stress his subtlety with no voice over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees it's not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about i don't find them absurd i find them all very neat and interesting individuals br br unless of course he didn't intend such juxtapositions which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter considering none of this films i've seen so far have particularly impressed me i don't really care to find out what he's trying to do br br polarisdib
<START> this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci fi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also good br br director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci fi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 1 2 br br
<START> i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought time to watch it big mistake br br a long list of stars cannot save this turkey surely one of the worst movies ever an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well br br i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks take for example pat morita even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times br br save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer even when you see it in the under 5 throw away bin at your local store resist the urge
<START> fassbinder's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations here it's much more overt since the story takes place in war torn germany at the end of wwii and the central character is a woman hanna schygulla as maria who capitalizes on vulnerabilities both economic and gender related to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers as she once was married amidst allied air raids maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's shipped out to the russian front in his absence her despair is great she spends most days at the train station waiting for him to return when he is reported dead she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi's br br when he returns things get plenty messy as circumstances and his sense of noble self sacrifice conspire to keep them apart the message is fassbinder's m o writ large 'love is colder than death ' but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post war germany selling out to the highest bidder but as with all his films i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display fassbinder's as evoked through his characters his actors' as filtered through their real life connections with fassbinder taken together his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric often at once this falls somewhere in between although definitely closer to the latter while i didn't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what's more i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions
<START> this movie is trash poor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real events which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out of place not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting what's worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting d ck smker in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni collete's character is just plain annoying and a re hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction very miss able
<START> this is not a love song br br my one word summary of this film would be excellent' br br it probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public Â it's a br br film that forces you to participate you observe think and question br br comparisons could be made with deliverance topic theme and br br perhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style br br however this film stands unique against both br br the cinematography effects solarisation freeze frame blur etc br br have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this br br film to underpin the natural tension of the story br br acting is raw menacing and utterly believable br br the real theme of the film is about friendship the title really gives br br the game away it's probably not the kind of friendship that most of br br us have experienced or indeed would want to br br it is a love song
<START> this is the best film version of dicken's classic tale i've seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv not wide screen what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films shows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
<START> i originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable tv what a surprise and delight everyone is covertly armed in this movie dreyfuss plays the mental don remember the new york don who was supposed to be schizophrenic art imitates life or vice versa diane lane and ellen barkin are at their most beautiful and not to be toyed with thus proving that beauty and toughness do go together then there is the great bullshit scene between barkin and jeff goldblum rita and mickey where they verbally play off the world bullshit this film is both subtle and bald for all the shooting it can be a very quiet film and you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles joey bishop richard pryor henry silva it is not a film for everyone but if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight this is the film for you roger ebert dumps on this film he's flat wrong this is a fine fine film maybe just not one for ebert i consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be while not really being a straight comedy kind of film i like it so well that i bought it on dvd because it just doesn't get shown very much on cable tv now it's all mine
<START> michelle rodrigez was made for this movie when i first saw her in fast and the furious you could tell that she was a tough woman with this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie she is more a bad girl and that's what i like about her this movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her even though they don't think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrong br br i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done it shows that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the potential i recommend it to be seen
