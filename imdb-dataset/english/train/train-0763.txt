<START> the london underground has something inherently creepy about it with its long winding tunnels the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats roaming the tracks it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep br br i thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that i'd switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a favourable impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even potente herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he ceases to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x files type thing and reminds one of the episode tombs in fact i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me br br as for the infamous sexualised violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film br br so there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you don't see him very often but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film
<START> oxford mississippi at least okay the paris we get is paris culver city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing nowhere is better okay kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn ditto but alan lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated comden and green who scripted kelly's other 'big' 50s musical singin' in the rain a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by other lyricists and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed nacio herb brown numbers so alan lerner didn't have to feel too outclassed the story needn't detain us any more than the anomalies kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter i e bohemian yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when foch invites him to dinner at her hotel in the well documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers by other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic this is after all a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square as feel good musicals go it's definitely in the top 10
<START> how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me this movie is absolutely terrible i discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply puzzles me because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution it's not just that it's a bad movie with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible for example we see donald sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face he does not normally have a mole the mole does not add to his character it is extremely ugly and distracting it's not like robert de niro's mole it's much worse why the hell has he got that mole it's as if the filmmakers just said let's see how could we make this movie even worse than it already is i know let's give mr sutherland a giant ugly ass mole right on his face br br another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character ned we see for the first three quarters of the movie young ned at one point six months later appears on the screen we see ned again and it is of course the same actor playing the boy five minutes later three weeks later appears on the screen and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned what do they think we're idiots good god again it's like the filmmakers are saying how can we possibly make it any worse i don't think we can oh wait i just had a terrible idea i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year which is fine but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks just don't get another actor to play ned or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger furthermore the kid who plays the older ned does not look any older than young ned as a matter of fact he just looks completely different much skinnier and no taller or older than the original actor which is very confusing as i like any rational human being thought at first that it was a new and different character br br what did the first kid die while they were filming the movie because he was in it for the first hour and a half and then all of a sudden three weeks later the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie and even if the original actor did die the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role and re shoot the measly five minutes of six months later scenes better yet just scrap the movie completely never finish it and never release never even tell anybody about it because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time br br i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it it's so bad that you should watch it just to see how badly it sucks it's terrible terrible
<START> wow what a great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta jones hank azaria what's that a script you say now you're just being greedy surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary you'd think so but no america's sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another it's like everyone involved woke up before each day's writing shooting editing and though you know what i've been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right i'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can so much potential yet so painful to sit through there isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck even julia's fat suit is lame
<START> ashley judd in an early role and i think her first starring role shows her real life rebellious nature in this slow moving feminist soap opera wow is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what br br being a staunch feminist in real life she must have cherished this script no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie it's right up his political alley too br br unlike the reviewers here i am glad judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not preached the heavy handed liberal agenda
<START> if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you you've chosen the wrong film br br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things don't happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything we're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life we're talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed we're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybody br br i am from that small island and i've heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up that's how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his mate's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too tb was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms after the war there were times of hardship br br so you won't find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody you'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they don't br br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan that was remarkable
<START> this movie was excellent for the following reasons 1 it contained great backdrops and sets 2 it showed the disparity of a war torn environment alongside a technological one 3 john cusack's acting was terrific he portrayed angst very well 4 it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war torn situation 5 it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects i was also impressed with the acting for the most part hilary's acting was i found the most stilted the morals and values of everyone in a war torn situation are up for grabs the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable great stuff psp
<START> this was fun to watch spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance br br it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third columnists br br but arthur askey was so annoying unfunny you just wanted him to shut up well at least i did i suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded br br a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like uncomfortable slow dirty trains being thrown off for no reason surly staff
<START> this is an extraordinary film that tricks you constantly it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles it would give away too much to say much more but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded william haines is absolutely delightful he is certainly a star that deserves to be re discovered the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing there is even a scene where haines rubs pickford's chest pickford has a cold both actors play this sub text subtlely and with great depth of emotion so that there are moments that are very moving and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie and i don't even understand the rules also excellent is francis x bushman's son ralph as haines' rival for the girl yes it's not completely a gay movie wonderful silent classic a great example of twenties commercial cinema with an edge
<START> the only reason i saw shakedown was that it has erika eleniak in it she's sexy as always but she plays second fiddle to leading man wolf larson it's a pity because she has more action capabilities than she's allowed to show here the film largely consists of endless shootouts that quickly become monotonous especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing larson and him armed only with a revolver that never runs out of bullets taking them all out rather easily the earthquake effects are decent but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poor cgi explosions as the psychotic spiritual leader ron perlman tries but the pseudo religious mumbo jumbo he has to spout is simply boring eleniak perlman or larson assuming he has any completists might want to give this one a look for others it is barely worth a rental 1 2
<START> robert altman's downbeat new fangled western from edmund naughton's book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario the characters here don't merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turn of the century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limited most of the story being made up of vignettes and altman's pacing is deliberately slow there's hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds it's a self defeating picture and yet in an altman quirky way it wears defeat proudly from
<START> i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it the actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great the music was lush and well thought out it even had a decent twist of an ending so what's with everyone voting it down the story wasn't entirely fresh felt like a remnant of running man with the whole television show idea but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity br br it's possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word god in it but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some br br i gave it a 7 10 stars here on imdb i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original for the most part check it out if you're not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid spain about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you
<START> michael rooker is a decent actor but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie he really does not have much charisma ryo ishibashi has a lot more screen presence and sadly he is not really the main character most of the screen time goes to the brick faced rooker br br danielle harris from the halloween 4 and 5 movies plays his daughter and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed comedians fred willard bobcat goldthwait and stephen furst are here in interesting roles just watching what happens to these characters is priceless br br vincent schiavelli plays the consigliare to the local mafia godfather and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy tim thomerson is also in this movie he seems to be in every extremely low budget direct to video action movie thomerson is also in some low budget comedies seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof is it a parody of a yakuza movie it is hard to tell at some points there is certainly very little yakuza action br br the supporting cast of thugs and goons is menacing and well cast some of these kinds of movies have thugs that look like they work at the local comic book store or as stock boys at piggly wiggly overall this movie is very uneven at some points it seems like a comedy or a parody then at other points it works as a good action movie then it sputters to an end without the contributions of danielle harris and ryo ishibashi this movie would rate a zero in my humble opinion
<START> eric rohmer's the lady and the duke could have used a better translation for the title the english woman and the duke perhaps would have been more accurate while it's obvious this film is not for everyone judging by the comments to this forum it is worth watching because in spite of the intricate pattern of the story mr rohmer has created a movie that could be seen as an art exhibit in a museum the mixed technology used in the movie ultimately works well br br the strange story of grace elliott a noble lady who had been the mistress of the king of england and of the french duc d'orleans holds our attention the setting is paris during the days that followed the french revolution the country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people who couldn't care less for the aristocrats the images show the agitators running around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the guillotine br br grace relation with the duc had ended but she remains a true friend to the great man that is in danger himself of losing his own head grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able of an escape she even has an enemy in her own house in the form of the cook pulcherie who would not hesitate to denounce her at the least provocation br br watching the movie at times gives the viewer the impression one is going on a trip through the louvre watching those huge canvases that depict this crucial era of the french history rather than finding the digitalization process distracting we found it to enhance the film in many ways br br lucy russell as grace elliott does a fine job to portray this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime her french seems to be excellent as it appears she is fluent in it as the duc d'orleans jean claude dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort the supporting cast also was great as an ensemble piece mr rohmer gets good performances all around br br for lovers of history the lady and the duke will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to the vision of eric rohmer
<START> he pulled the guys guts out his butt that's a spoof right no one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong i think any way this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard br br director says next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor get this he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole br br brilliant the entire cast proclaims br br no way can that happen nobody writes that stupid gotta be a spoof br br i loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave i wasn't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door br br what the heck is that richard greco guy doing in this did he fire his agent or something br br can anyone explain the ending to me please because i didn't get it either i can't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea never mind i don't want to know
<START> this is an excellent movie it is about many things the hunt for a serial killer the bureacracy of soviet russia the drive of one man and the relationship between this man the lead detective and his superior br br the thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between durokov rea and fetisov sutherland excuse bad spelling please for some reason it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together one line in the movie sums it up for me he would say something witty but he is overcome with emotion br br excellent acting by all of the cast even the smallest parts were done with believability br br this is not a fast paced action thriller in fact it moves at times like a slow drama but it is worth it very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all br br
<START> i got this movie in the 5 bin at walmart i would not recommend watching this move i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours br br i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie it's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam br br okay here is my rant about this movie to me this movie is slow and hard to watch it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end it doesn't after the movie was over i through it behind my t v because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it
<START> another violent angry fantasy from paul verhoeven verhoeven is a puzzle it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world and this has some outstanding ones cannot hide a negligence to story dialogue and performance kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side the river wild' in an attempt to offset his boyish looks given the material however bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who when forced to deliver inane dialogue embarrass themselves the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended
<START> forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister emilio richard cambridge ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday 'in the middle of nowhere' their words not mine anyway before they know it they're deep in a forest emilio clumsily runs over a woman frances da costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they're travelling in won't start they can't get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woods br br this english production was written directed by johannes roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it other's not personally it didn't do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with 'additional screenplay material' whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then there's stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the character's are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that's going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes here br br director johannes doesn't do anything special it's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at there's a few decent horror scenes the tom savini character is great whenever he's on screen although why didn't he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly it's a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in there's a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps much br br technically forest of the damned is ok it's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye catching this was shot in england wales it's quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than acting br br forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe i'm missing something but it's not a film i have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments there's not much here to recommend
<START> this movie is a waste of time and money throughout the entire hour and a half i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did it was slow moving the plot jumped around it wasn't scary or interesting and really never amounted to anything the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out which was basically like the rest of the movie long and drawn out numerous parts of the plot made no sense several times during the movie i had thought that maybe i had zoned out because the incongruity of the plot however my companion had the same issue and assured me i did not zone out from boredom but it was indeed the movie i've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on imdb for numerous years so the fact that i'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it
