<START> i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick i was thoroughly disappointed it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching 'friday the 13th jason takes manhattan' so much potential wasted br br the opening scene is a decent attention grabber then it grinds to a halt copious breasts and egregious 80s fashion cannot help this movie the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha i'm not asking for 'cannibal holocaust' level of gore but i was looking for cheap over the top exploitative gore i got none of that br br i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing hence the 2 stars i don't think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background but i would not tell anyone oh dude you gotta see this movie it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention
<START> and i really mean that i caught it last night on vh1 and i was not expecting it to be so good this is now one of my favorites i must add that it has a killer soundtrack
<START> five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye br br lucky me five bad movies for the price of one each segment features the very worst in acting special effects make up and music and these were supposed to be scary hmm i think i've been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies i swear you'll sit there like i was bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen don't bother it never does in fact i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature and the ending is the ultimate cop out yep none of this actually ever happened if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers 2 10
<START> when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the probable chance that i've not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without realising that it's actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here more's the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittens br br following well worn clichÃ©s the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked but you'll never guess what happens next a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly haven't you got better things to worry about br br the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio's bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger it's far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you'd see in the buffy the vampire slayer tv show aren't really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know it's funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest i've had more fun in a dentist br br the convent isn't really a horror movie as such it's more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but you're laughing at it instead of with it i honestly can't recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much they'd enjoy it i don't enjoy the so bad that it's good genre i personally feel that if the film makers can't be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn't bust a gut trying to watch it yes it's a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive a rubik's cube for example the dvd box has two price stickers one for Â£4 99 and a reduced price of Â£3 but it was sold for Â£1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of unholy crap
<START> when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his character movies but it was my ambition to own them too what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen year old i must have been thankfully sense prevailed and live a little love a little is the only elvis film i own br br the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years Â his first uk no 1 in 25 even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren't exactly first rate however a little less conversation rollnecks and 60s grooving aside is a real standout finding a lesser known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions it's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated but it's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult and what chauvinistic lyrics too though what other elvis song contains the word procrastinate br br but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it actually based on a novel kiss my firm but pliant lips what kind of lame novel would that be this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho within 90 seconds of meeting him michele carey asks would you like to make love to me quite a fast mover by any standards i'm sure you'll agree br br i do seem to recall that some of elvis's early movies most notably jailhouse rock and king creole weren't too bad but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh and models dress as pink mermaids there's even a dream sequence for god's sake maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn't conform to is in not having all that many songs with just four to choose from including the credits number you're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain of the remaining three tracks then the edge of reality isn't actually that bad though elvis's dance to it must surely have been called the bear trap br br in one sense for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content sadly however with talking dogs middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you'll ever see elvis's dignity is obliterated by this movie
<START> first off i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it no stars it really is that bad i was never eager to see this film after i saw the ads for it i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big named stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations however about 10 20 minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated i was shocked at how terrible the script was it really gave the actors nothing to work with so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing especially luke wilson the story was completely predictable if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie and there was nothing original about it it pretty much borrows from every 'super hero' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre but alas it wasn't the direction seemed to be of realism i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well she's dead time to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense i found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it and then it struck me i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made and still pull a large audience i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made for movies to be made these days the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage i can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage by the end and exceedingly dumb founding ly stupid climax i was laughing heartily just not at what the film makers wanted me to laugh at but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was thank god i didn't have to pay money to see it because that would have really annoyed me oh and could i just add that of the two wilson brothers i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better more versatile actor but if he wants to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours and remember it only got a generous 1 10 because i couldn't select 0
<START> it may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca 10 10 role for the best actor oscar i still would have given the oscar to bogie but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least well i'm glad i did check this movie out because i enjoyed it immensely i think the movie did preach a little but not only did i not mind i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them br br the acting was outstanding in this movie i especially enjoyed paul lukas lucile watson rightfully nominated for an oscar bette davis wrongfully not nominated george coulouris and oddly eric roberts who plays the middle child i really enjoyed his character an odd looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher he just cracks me up even the characters name bodo is funny br br the ending in which lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and i understood why he couldn't quite explain it the message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent watch this movie if you ever get a chance br br 9 10
<START> three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed drugs ego and bad attitudes interesting and well done this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over even though these folks were the scum of the earth i still found myself pitying them they never really stood much of a chance
<START> either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman jewison a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the paucity of cher's acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic strokes broad at times a hair salon called cinderella but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10
<START> dear dear dear dear dear me i had the strength to see it through but why br br the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing this was some kind of tremors for kids i can't believe this movie was made at all seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with it br br what audience is this movie for i can only think of 12 14 year olds if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie it's not only slow but it's so utterly boring the characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped it's fun for a while but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen you know everything that is going to happen too cause yes you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced it's so bad so wrong so crap br br but ok we did get a laugh now and then not just at the silly plot holes but some scenes where worth a replay or two or one scene that is where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly still makes me grin when i think about it but that only happened one more time sadly and that's when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully that and one comment they spring from the ground like some demonic trout at this point we where almost crying with laughter but after that nothing could ever top that so it's pretty much downhill from there br br so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie he's either a plant vegetable or someone very evil this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far looking forward to seeing tremors 3 it's bound to be box office hit compared to this this goosebumps no i'll leave it at that
<START> years have past since alex rain played by olivier gruner in the first movie stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of olivier gruner's character she also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability which i think is the films minimal connection to the first however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci fi clunker nemesis became a cult hit that i can see why people liked even though i was no fan of said film nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action it almost worked nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition it's a cheap rip off of the terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes olivier gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original i'll admit i was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this the original also featured a good cast like tim thomerson cary hiroyuki tagawa thom mathews brion james thomas jane and yes jackie earle haley this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe in fact after i saw this it inspired to add a half star to the original br br out of 4 bad
<START> oh dear what a disappointment i've been watching old westerns on british tv for decades and i wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again br br the rich colour and outdoor sets were good but that's all i can say about this film i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made several times i felt like turning it off and finally i did halfway through something i hardly ever do br br scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad and i've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns br br perhaps it got better in the second half but i couldn't be bothered to wait and see
<START> i can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film this is laural and hardy lighten up already these two were a riot their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago not a filthy word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in stitches their comedy wasn't sophisticated by any stretch if a whoopee cushion can't make you grin there's no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did it was a simpler time and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot i guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff so i qualify two man comedy teams don't compute we're just too sophisticated aren't we fortunate
<START> this film was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it's quality while i grew up this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well the only drawback there is is that one can not see past the Âbad' effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child i remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film when i was about eleven years old who then watches effects one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film there is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old all of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors in that department sabu as abu and conrad veidt as jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part great film and although an 'oldie' definitely a Âgoldie' i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday br br 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of the best hong kong action films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights sammo fans this is a must see see also eastern condors shanghai express yuen biao is ace dragons forever and enter the fat dragon
<START> this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray
<START> 'the omen 4 the awakening' is a made for television sequel to the original 'the omen' film instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong the film seems to struggle with any horror factor and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan even with all of the events that surround it i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening particularly when compared to the original
<START> the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ somehow according to the plot god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer the lead character an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment silly
<START> ok so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable br br the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie's in the t films and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same br br so to the film itself a reasonable us brit cast are able to flesh out this little story not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving gullible cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other br br kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career unlike maybe escape from la sequels are such fickle creatures sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci fi lineage and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly br br if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> the often reliable leonard maltin says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb maltin must have confused this movie with something else sanders is snide and droll and superb as usual Â you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three Âbut dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately the storyline itself an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief francois eugene vidocq who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette and certainly the deplorable forever amber which screams for a classy remake though in his defense sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character it is all for naught i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan but this is 1946 and it is one of sirk's earliest american efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid breast heaving potboilers sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession and hit his stride bombarding us with such estrogen fests as all that heaven allows written on the wind and imitation of life but scandal in paris is hardly his best work Â a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming
