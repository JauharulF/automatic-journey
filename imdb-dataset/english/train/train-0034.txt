<START> dressed to kill is one of the best thrillers ever made its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults brian de palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story he directs many scenes without dialog and he tells much of his story strictly through the use of his visuals and pino donnagio's brilliant score filmed in panavision the film must be seen in widescreen as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story cropped on video dressed to kill is barely the same movie solid performances from its cast superb direction and perhaps the finest film score ever written make dressed to kill a must see
<START> the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish spectacular looking production it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy but i think it is a notch above episode iv and just a notch below episodes iii and v in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6 part saga as far as i'm concerned it is still a grandiosely entertaining film it is not a movie with a beginning climax and ending the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind bring closure to lucas' universe there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing which makes the film a little too sentimental but emotionally rewarding also it is a lot of fun new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges c3po and r2d2 provide as usual great comic relief leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo and luke is still a great character to identify with again it is luke's and vader's inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the film's themes of loyalty hope and redemption resonate strongly i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii viii and ix because this film is a great bookend to a long fascinating and captivating saga not a perfect movie but fun in the best matinÃ©e style
<START> well to answer one persons's question of why doesn't anyone remember this film it's because really not that many people saw it in 1978 and it's not been shown much on tv since if it's on video that'd be news to me even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s movie goers had the smarts to avoid this film unless they love billy crytal paul lynde or joan rivers that much br br paul lynde was funnier on bewitched or hollywood squares than here joan rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer karen carpenter's lack of weight har har joan it also seems like every somewhat famous name from the era is in the cast most surprising is doris roberts later of everybody loves raymond br br anyhow a somewhat good idea for a storyline a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here with help from a male friend crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was on top instead of him he gets pregnant a commentary on women taking positions of power away from men br br crystal's stomach grows he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings unfortunately he is now a socially misunderstood outcast he's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out i guess br br he's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby in a barn or if you will a manger god only knows where it may have exited from ewwww it turns out no shock here to be a girl br br everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable the humor is high school level or less br br 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching relevant moments w billy crystal ignore the rest of rabitt test it flunks big time br br i can't believe roddy mcdowell signed on either end
<START> edmund lowe who reminds me somewhat of warren william heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour br br douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise hypnotism anyone and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast everyone from virginia bruce kent smith frieda inescourt gene lockhart jessie ralph benita hume rosalind ivan and h b warner as an added bonus there's nat pendleton as a dimwit detective and furthermore get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film br br on the plus side the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled it's all suddenly clear to detective philo vance and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense br br nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner
<START> i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not a strictly biographical film it is loosely based on the facts but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr petiot br br there are many memorable images in this movie petiot traveling through the night like a vampire his black cloak flapping behind him is almost iconic there are also several touches of expressionism petiot's crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation reminds me of some scenes from 'nosferatu' br br but i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits accompanied by wordless wailing petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw there are animal noises as well the concierge keeps a goat unseen cats howl and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtones of violence and slaughter br br not only animals but human voices are often heard the screams of gestapo victims petiot's patients in his waiting room monitored by a listening device just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them when petiot goes to see mme kern we hear her singing as she works her voice echoing in the theater before we ever see her and even when she does appear she is often filmed from behind her voice calling out to her husband whose voice calls out to her in conversation disembodied voices echo in large halls and their owners when seen at all are photographed at a distance so we cannot actually see them speaking this is a ghost story and these are the voices of ghosts many of them petiot's future victims br br yet petiot himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in a way he is as much a ghost as those he murders he is always frantically busy scurrying from appointment to appointment never at rest but his activity is that of a machine lifeless and imperturbable it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris petiot alone is unafraid he is amused enthusiastic angry irritated contemptuous but never afraid unlike those real people he lures to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions including a perpetual motion machine a true detail from the book he did claim to have invented many machines he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to petiot's bicycle with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical write a note to your wife let me disguise you before you leave you need a vaccination barcelona casablanca dakar like a well oiled machine the routine is always the same just as the record is always the same br br maeder the author says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiot's involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis unfortunately it doesn't quite work as part of the story because it's very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night disposing of bodies hiding stolen goods it's hard to say and harder to believe it's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiot br br but it does remind us of the duality of evil people petiot is a robber and a murderer but he is also a devoted father and husband just as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are happening all around nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile
<START> this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme 1989 and nemesis olivier gruner 1993 are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's albert pyun who has directed these two as well br br the story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and there's the story the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind br br in this movie the director tries some hong kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far the movie fails miserably in this attempt br br i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you can't stand van damme then check out nemesis br br i rated this movie 1 10
<START> this is so bad so very very bad the acting is the biggest joke in history don't even bother to see it i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning i really don't understand peoples taste i'm a horror movie fan and i'm not fastidious but i do have a limit maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of the hoast but that's it so i recommend you don't waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch i mean the acting is better done by monkeys and the big brother with the parental role is just awful don't they pay characters in c movies no i must say it's not the first time i think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with portrait of a vampire cabin by the lake the hoast
<START> first i'd like to excuse my bad english br br i'm not a hostel hardcore fan but i liked that movie nevertheless live feed however sucked big time i have never seen a gore movie with superb acting but hey who's surprised the acting in live feed was well not there i've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something okey but not by students in media or acting school this was no class at all and what about the story a really sad rip off on hostel and what about the gore what about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold sweating that was the most disappointing about the hole movie short quick and no edge more like an execution rather than a torture okey there where buckets of blood but it didn't even look real the slaughtering and the violence reminded more of braindead than hostel or any of the saw movies and braindead was fun okey i laughed at live feed a couple of times but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun br br so instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching live feed watch anything else
<START> br br film dominated by raven haired barbara steele it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle seeking blood steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty and the views of the walking dead pre date romero's night of the living dead shamblers unifying them in my mind br br i don't see the connection between this film and the haunting which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present la danza macabre is a b movie without pretention daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences there's no such draw to haunting's overwrought claire bloom the comparisons to the haunting are superficial br br and no this movie does not need to be remade not only is it a product of the sixties but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabre's formula for terror that formula is based on one overriding factor good writing low grade classics like castle and corman's poe films with r matheson and tourneur's out of the past share a commonality of strong writing it's simple get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess besides that let hollywood attempt some original material for a change and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past
<START> you can debate prince's acting talent or even his choice to parody his own life in this film there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now he seems like a shadowy has been twenty years later but the music remains relevant and fantastic br br having lived through the hype of this movie graduated high school in'85 i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time from tipper gore al's wife trying to censor little nikki and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc parents music resource center to every air band at the time impersonating prince it was the absolute hottest thing out for a few weeks at least prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson br br we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered it didn't disappoint everyone was caught up i was an mtv junkie at the time they actually played music then all the time prince played at least once or twice an hour i must qualify this commentary by saying that at that time my favorites were billy idol oingo boingo the fixx flock of seagulls and others in the punk new wave genre' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then it was mainstream and it seems like a clichÃ©' now it got so popular that it became ridiculous it's like the rappin' granny commercial for wendy's hamburgers br br it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it sadly kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something anyway i hope this gave you all a little insight
<START> what could have been an engaging and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor fox is ok as nathaniel ayers the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row looking for a good story to boost his flagging career reporter steve lopez robert rehab downey gets to know him and tells his story taking every element of the classic how we hit the skids movies borrowing very liberally from a beautiful mind taking the bogus feel good attitude of films like rocky you pick the sequel number and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie it is corny trite utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments i hate to say it but this is the kind of movie that if you say you hated it people will give you bad looks i really wish i could say something positive about this film but i really can't the acting redeems it somewhat but not enough for me to give it more than one star strictly made for tv movie stuff not worth your time
<START> one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim in their underwear rather risquÃ© for 1931
<START> fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film it has all the pieces of acting direction storyline and entertainment value they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece fay grim br br this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry's these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings fay is sent to find these journals in return to release her brother from prison and is sent on a cat and mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about br br parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies posey made me believe what was happening on screen i felt for her i rooted for her and i wanted to know more she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her br br i haven't seen any other previous works by writer director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was br br if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely
<START> many of the american people would say what to my opening comment yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa but if you analyze this movie my comment is right we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village the great difference is the way that the story takes our samurais a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs heroes please watch again this incredible movie the seven samurai obviously and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller's but he didn't found the third foot of the cat
<START> jason priestly stars as 'breakfast' a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is frighteningly precarious according to the dvd sleeve with his accomplice 'panda' bernie coulson the duo make off with a carload of cash a result of a tip off from beautiful cashier 'ziggy' laura harris her reward to hitch a ride with the out of control duo so that she can meet her long lost father francis stephen mchattie but he's on a suicidal quest to even a score with his former boss louis gossett jr and has the cops hot on his trail rage murder and revenge are about to collide stay out of their way br br the highwayman 4 28 00 keoni waxman jason priestly laura harris stephen mchattie
<START> i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers they are too critical perhaps because they are stuck in the past i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct 1 perhaps someone very young i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind br br it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1 but the plot is less confused it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well this remains her defining role david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective
<START> filmed in a documentary style but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached a recently divorced wannabe film maker myles berkowitz sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications the comedy is spotty at best the rest is mishap after mishap also taking part are richard arlook robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date
<START> a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort holes doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp for the first time events are not explained in details the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character like learning to read won't contribute to that holes is a movie that is smart and beautiful a must watch
<START> this is one very dire production the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal she was a very beautiful young woman here was the production's weakest point the actress failed to get that across it also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser from the outset the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical br br the production was a flaw ridden clichÃ© ridden embarrassing load of rubbish i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas
<START> a good cast and they do their best with what they're given but the story makes no sense the characters' actions are inexplicable and there are too many moments of unintentional humor as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off the scene when the two witch and her victim played by the same actress are in the house together sets up like a 3 stooges routine and the plot begs the question if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase not to be missed is christopher walkin's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife paraphrased the ancient egyptianas they wee materialists they expected the body to last through eternity like a used car that you souped up but the druids they knew you couldn't drive in the afterlife you had to get out and walk huh the ending is absolutely indecipherable seems like they just ran out of film
