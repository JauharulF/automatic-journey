<START> antonio margheriti's danza macabra aka castle of blood of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror and after mario bava's la maschera del demonio aka black sunday of 1960 and roger corman's pit and the pendulum of 1961 starring the great vincent price another must see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all time the screenplay to danza macabra was co written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as django 1966 and the great silence 1968 italy's number 2 in the field right after mario bava director antonio margheriti is one of the all time masters of gothic horror and castle of blood is doubtlessly his greatest achievement hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece br br when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories edgar allen poe in a gloomy london tavern young journalist alan foster georges riviÃ¨re accepts a bet from a nobleman that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls' eve as soon as foster enters the eerie castle mysterious things start to happen after a little while however he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood barbara steele the mysterious events so far however have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears however br br the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele and no actress ever will besides steele the movie's cast contains another stunning beauty margarete robsahm and she also delivers a great performance george riviÃ¨re's performance as alan foster is great and the rest of the performances are also very good castle of blood is outstanding in many departments barbara steele delivers one of her best performances the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison the atmosphere is incredibly eerie the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere gothic beauty and the art of terror in short castle of blood is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre 10 10
<START> a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie personally i can't do that with a drama and found this too far fetched br br i'm particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no movie br br the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named magruder played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl mallory doss played by embeth davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home br br she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken br br things are very odd she's weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked Â oh yeah also the father's strange the house is a wreck everything should have told magruder hey this is too weird for me i'm out of here ' but not magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams set up br br then being the top flight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16 year old magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him i could have believed begrudging assistance but no help at all not likely br br it's just too unlikely
<START> i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie but that did not disappoint me at all it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film we need many more like these
<START> what an unfortunate mess is shiner i wanted to like this over the top anti film aspirant and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance sadly those moments are few and far between while i appreciate some of what calson was attempting any advantage aspired to by bare bones no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all br br while bad acting abounds in low budget and big budget cinema shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch in particular the straight couple linda and young guy these are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story the acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill the choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film it would have been better off as such br br with all that is going wrong for it there are several performances that seem to capture what calson was hoping to get in particular the story centering on bob and tim these are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by nicholas t king bob and david zelinas tim tim is a boxer with some serious issues remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating obsessed with tim the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy bob stalks the boxer in classic cat and mouse fashion when the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted the resulting in the film's only genuine emotional catharsis in a film so artificially hard edged that's a compliment one character must have that revelatory break through or breakdown as the case proves here and the final confrontation between bob and tim provide zelinas and king opportunity to display some real acting chops br br as played by scott stepp and derris nile tony and danny seem to be the focus of the movie and despite some bravado moments of their own including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex violence obsession but they can't seem to escape a cartoon like artifice and it's difficult to look at or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious br br ultimately this same raw material could and should be used to tell this story in better fashion alas there really isn't much to recommend this yet the performances by messrs king and zelinas really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing
<START> well what can i say having just watched this fantastic film when my nerves are still jangling jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france and rightly so vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either but these two are fantastic actors and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax others have written about the plot so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection the director the actors right down to the cameraman and everything seems so real no stupid gun play the fighting when it happens is so credible the expressions the emotions it is almost as you are there as a spectator do yourself a favour get the dvd a bottle of wine turn the lights low take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller
<START> if you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals in a kentucky correctional prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results this film shows how it was all doneÂ the castingÂ the rehearsalsÂ the set and costumesÂand the final presentation of shakespeare's play the tempest it had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison in the play the ship wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world prison life too is much like that br br with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure br br more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character one inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events br br the prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example it seems to me that everyone stands to benefitÂnot only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole
<START> having just watched this movie i almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life but i guess there is some good in everything br br if i was to rate this as any other movie it can only receive 1 or 2 tops but if i grade it like a low budget ind movie it may get 3 or 4 that is a movie is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time this movie isn't but i guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills and considering this this movie has a few highlights if i am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project i guess the distorted sound effects had some quality they also manage to build some characters this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project because the character building takes too long since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project whats the point i guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything building characters suspense and a plot and ends up being nothing not a lot br br this movie tries too much and too hard and i guess it should have been cut to a short film i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie br br there is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie the story should have been more streamlined i know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie but a slight surprise to who the killer is doesn't make a mystery the story behind the mystery receives almost no attention during the film which leaves the final point as a quick an unsatisfying wrap up br br therefore i would like to say this movie was a nice try but i cant i hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time br br if you don't have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies there is no need to watch this not even too see why everyone thinks its bad br br as others have stated i am pretty sure the many 10's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie this movie could not receive a 10 judging from any remotely objective standpoint
<START> brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting migs down in the korean war on leave he discovers his madame butterfly falls in love the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations br br this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards dominant at the time it was made in 1957 sayonara will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving berlin's title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again
<START> what can i say about the first film ever br br you can't rate this because it's not supposed to be entertaining but if you have to rate it you should give it a 10 it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895 this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever br br
<START> hundstage is seidl's first fiction film before this he directed great documentaries as animal love or models seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years but it only cost around 2 million dollars the actors are very good especially the non professional actors who nearly played themselves the cinematography is good too the whole film is shocking disturbing and some scenes may be too much for ordinary viewers the film shows a lot of sex and violence but also that people are lonely and not able to communicate with each other finally i've to say that this is one of the best and most rewarding austrian films in the past years please excuse my bad english br br
<START> may i please have my 13 00 back i would have rather watched hydro electric power comes to north america again this is a movie with one voice the same voice which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least 150 an hour and i don't take insurance it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody but i don't think imaginative casting is enough one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie unless he's just doing it for the money and if that's the case why not just reissue an all rap version of what's up tiger lily
<START> i'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film the lion's share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the brotherhood of the protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the church in the other version which i've seen only once on tv the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church meaning the archdiocese of new york or perhaps brooklyn also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father so and so but the dubbed audio says brother so and so in the latter version i believe everyone is referred to as father br br in any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re shooting of the other with all brotherhood of the protector scenes re shot as archdiocese scenes or vice versa kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in godzilla i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv so no i'm not imagining this can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film
<START> i'm here again in your local shopping mall of course 'cause that's where the high school kids hang out to demonstrate how awful bendy poo prom courier really is to prove how bad this joke of a dcom this is br br we're going to take these four sumo wrestlers and stuff them into this photo booth how cozy br br hai huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh uh br br how awful is it it's so bad disney channel flushes away its money yet again with those exciting yet determining 10 second promos keeping the viewers wondering when is this going to be on and then suddenly when it does come on for one this not only got a higher tv rating than usual but this was only seen once oh no one time everyone plus this movie is about high school and stuff and believe me i will not go any further with what else is in there br br say ch smile snap br br avoid this one at all costs 0 10
<START> i can't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end and it did the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did and probably the worst prosecutor on earth why was he in court anyway he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings but no go he preferred to say objection 2 or 3 times during the whole trial that was it the blonde lunatic was given a truth drug to prove her innocent but not brett the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession but again no go during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head even real weirdos do not look that silly fake i am innocent like she did and what does this movie tell us never marry a woman with a life insurance as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail guilty or not evil evil men
<START> as a lifelong fan of dickens i have invariably been disappointed by adaptations of his novels br br although his works presented an extremely accurate re telling of human life at every level in victorian britain throughout them all was a pervasive thread of humour that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictated in a way he was a literary caricaturist and cartoonist he could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence he pricked pride lampooned arrogance celebrated modesty and empathised with loneliness and poverty it may be a clichÃ© but he was a people's writer br br and it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations at the time of writing oliver twist is being dramatised in serial form on bbc television all of the misery and cruelty is their but non of the humour irony and savage lampoonery the result is just a dark dismal experience the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist it's not really dickens at all br br 'oliver ' on the other hand is much closer to the mark the mockery of officialdom is perfectly interpreted from the blustering beadle to the drunken magistrate the classic stand off between the beadle and mr brownlow in which the law is described as 'a ass a idiot' couldn't have been better done harry secombe is an ideal choice br br but the blinding cruelty is also there the callous indifference of the state the cold hunger poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as the master would have wished br br and then there is crime ron moody is a treasure as the sleazy jewish fence whilst oliver reid has bill sykes to perfection br br perhaps not surprisingly lionel bart himself a jew from london's east end takes a liberty with fagin by re interpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was dicken's original in the novel he was utterly ruthless sending some of his own boys to the gallows in order to protect himself though he was also caught and hanged whereas in the movie he is presented as something of a wayward father figure a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupter of children the latter being a long standing anti semitic sentiment otherwise very few liberties are taken with dickens's original all of the most memorable elements are included just enough menace and violence is retained to ensure narrative fidelity whilst at the same time allowing for children' sensibilities nancy is still beaten to death bullseye narrowly escapes drowning and bill sykes gets a faithfully graphic come uppance br br every song is excellent though they do incline towards schmaltz mark lester mimes his wonderfully both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to 'who will buy' it's schmaltzy but it's dickens through and through br br i could go on i could commend the wonderful set pieces the contrast of the rich and poor there is top quality acting from more british regulars than you could shake a stick at br br i ought to give it 10 points but i'm feeling more like scrooge today soak it up with your christmas dinner no original has been better realised
<START> when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller was tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape it wasn't after many years that i came across tarzan and his mate and then i understood weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker gordon scott jock mahoney denny miller miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert br br as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong self minded active and no inhibitions woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it such behaviors were unthinkable with the janes to come such as brenda joyce vanessa brown virginia huston or dorothy hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle br br o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day br br tarzan and his mate stands as a fine product in its genre tarzan films and perhaps as the best though i have to admit that i also enjoyed tarzan's greatest adventure 1959 made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man br br good for jane and her mate
<START> i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and i'm half way through mansfield park but i couldn't stand emma i gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about emma she didn't seem to change at all maybe it was paltrows acting which as excellent in se7en or my lack of interest for the movie dunno br br the costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehle br br i gave it a 2 basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor i liked his singing
<START> channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because it's so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throw up in your mouth bad br br there's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel i'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didn't learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scene wow a toilet yaayyyyy i don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells like and it looks like well you know the rest br br avoid like the plague br br edit apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence i e its refreshing to see br br sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly i'd rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again
<START> the good fellas at webster's dictionary define logophobia as the Âfear of words' i may just be logophobic for no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film credits contain the words produced written and directed by ' and are followed by a single individual's name think about it there are carpenters electricians and plumbers but so few jack of all trades even the most seasoned of directors like speilberg and scorsese rarely take such control of their films but there i was all nestled in my theatre seat popcorn in hand and about to watch the order when hurled at me like a nolan ryan fastball were the words produced written and directed by brian helgeland' whoa br br being a film buff i knew of brian helgeland as a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company's stock price in 1998 there were as many theatrical unpleasantries assassins the postman conspiracy theory as there were critical and award winning successes l a confidential mystic river they seemed to alternate Â one good one bad so knowing that his last film bloodwork was one of the most wasted efforts in clint eastwood's career i took a breath and hoped for the best in retrospect i should not have exhaled br br the order stars heath ledger helgeland's a knights tale as alex bernier a priest in an order known as the carolingians who is summoned to rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the arch bishop deems Âcurious' meeting up with father thomas also of the order and played wonderfully by still standings' mark addy they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest's untimely death br br complicating matters is a sub plot involving mara sinclair played by shannyn sossamon who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill alex during an exorcism alex has feelings towards mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience they travel to rome together br br nary a good nights sleep goes by and alex is confronted by william eden benno fÃ¼rmann who claims to be a centuries old sin eater a sin eater as we are told are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not thus allowing entrance into heaven william as luck would have it is tired of a life of healing and looks for alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties alex is reluctant but after the death of his new love mara alex resorts to the ritual of the sin eater to save her and the transformation is complete alex then searches for answers to his many queries while father thomas unveils the vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator br br the order is not a terrible film but it is terribly boring there were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters even in the most dramatic scene that of alex walking in on the dying mara is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple's plight everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film br br so mr helgeland i plead with you not to try this again share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self serving until then there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade two stars br br
