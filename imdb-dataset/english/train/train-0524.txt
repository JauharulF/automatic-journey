<START> this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open after a while a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back this was amazingly filmed with real animals how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable
<START> this movie is like the material s e hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s and had trueblood actually been a product of either the results might've been much better especially in the acting department instead we get a rather so bad its funny piece of mediocrity br br jeff fahey plays ray trueblood a former street rumbler i suppose is the accurate description this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music nonetheless ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother donny chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when on the run from the cops he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs although in a gang that was ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled and again cops must be dodged and this time a lady's honor defended in the action film sense before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother donny br br for the most part the film is quite ridiculous for me most of this has to do with far too much overacting although not by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs although the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989
<START> chris an adopted son of a moral family a loser whom works at the school newspaper with kate christine lakin from of the awful sugary step by step show of the now thankfully defunct abc's tgif line up finds out that he's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents he loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense he also has to contend with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer arn't they are a slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies the opening alone is highly american pie esquire bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets and wastes the only star talent it has wayne newton lin shaye and if i'm really stretching the star word martin starr of freaks and geeks and justin berfield of malcolm in the middle it's not bad exactly but it's far from good br br eye candy a few extras get topless br br my grade c br br where i saw it starz on demand available until september 29th
<START> is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture the premise is not too bad a naive front man for an illegal business but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work br br was this considered a good 'b' in 1942 hard to imagine the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several well known faces from the '30's and '40's such as warren hymer vince barnett and robert armstrong i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in lives of a bengal lancer so i wasn't counting him br br can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 if you have a choice get a root canal
<START> the subject matter seems pretty dated today adapted for tv from rona jaffe's book we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game mazes and dragons based on dungeons and dragons one player a young tom hanks enters the fantasy world too deep his co players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm br br david wallace wendy crewson and chris makepeace round out the game's foursome support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton vera miles anne francis and susan strasberg br br at this date it seems lumbering and tame but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his bosom buddies salad days and his big splash in splash on the silver screen the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment
<START> spoilers ahead proceed at your own caution br br my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers with relative ease he continues to cave into their demands and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped he decides to wire his classic car up to explode with the money in it which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic br br okay so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign this i can see but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence e g cini's body this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2 3 of it after that it sort of falls apart
<START> this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made it's a real pleaser to anyone it'll make you laugh it'll make you cry and it'll put you into suspense br br basically what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation they don't know what is going on and desperately wanting to go home they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness br br this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in he provided the voice of shadow the old wise and friendly golden retriever also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy the himalayan cat but seriously what this movie is all about is chance voiced by michael j fox my all time favorite actor chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog lovable playful energetic and goofy and every time i crack up when watching this movie it's because of chance it's like the comedy never ends br br this movie is also very sad at times it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets br br one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it the movie had other suspenseful moments but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one br br overall it's a wonderful family movie if you enjoyed this movie you'll probably enjoy the sequel too i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10
<START> this movie even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving strong film bette davis as the slutty vicious cockney waitress mildred is absolutely believable watching her performance is still spellbinding she makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time leslie howard's performance as the weak obsessed phillip carey is not as strong but i don't see how any actor could hold their own against ms davis's performance she chews up the scenery in every scene she is in totally stealing the show this is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the academy award but lost it was shocking for it's day what with themes of unwed pregnancy multiple sex partners and mildred's vicious language so it is somewhat dated but still an excellent movie just to see the scene where mildred tells phillip what she really thinks of him you cad you dirty swine is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film
<START> i'll keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius the actors are just perfect for the roles they play cj's character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful comedy br br when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over 6 7 months i wondered what had happened to paul i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google he was so funny and played his character to perfection an over protective dad who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boys br br the comedy i think has gone from strength to strength even without paul in it br br plus i think most people would enjoy this watching it
<START> knowing enki bilal's comics for quite some time i had to see this movie i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend and i thought i will enjoy watching it i was wrong the movie was a true torture to watch the idea has potential but movie leaves way too much to be desired and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it or that you're gonna see it but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes
<START> i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks perhaps for sex as well but not on indian tv anyway br br not being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff wincott and had no leads to search from only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic nurse coif so mayoral for the high top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her br br this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod and wink schlock Ã  la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for so bad it's good
<START> three years ago rachel therese fretwell was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns rachel's friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over so grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in rachel's constant nightmares as expected a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party this flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and 'winged it' very badly writer marcos gabriel gave himself the meatier role as rachel's boyfriend leo outside of fretwell and gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get 'offed' giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear erin gallagher andrew williams jasmine trice and derek nieves this is one memorial day you wouldn't mind missing
<START> first of all there is gujarati theatre then there is bollywood both have their strengths and fan following director vipul shah should look elsewhere instead of gujarati theatre when making a bollywood production first he made aankhen adapted from a gujarati play which had a unique plot but could not hold as a hindi film now he's adapted another gujarati play and named it waqt a race against time in sum the emotions are alien the plot development is not for hindi films for example the role play between father and son is best left to gujarati theatre don't bring it in a hindi film even the comedy track is best left for the gujarati stage all performances are average nothing to shout about barring shefali chhaya shah who is fantastic
<START> what a good film made men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns james belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff timothy dalton you wont be disappointed jump on board and enjoy the ride 8 out of 10
<START> thank god i didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life f g visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the director's ulli lommel profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2 and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie
<START> br br one of the best films i've ever seen robert duvall's performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars
<START> michael curtiz directed this 1930 very stylish whodunit from a script by robert presnell sr robert n lee and peter mine the original novel they adapted was the kennel murder case perhaps from a writer's standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s s van dine vance was a long worded and superior detective genius and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character later he was played by basil rathbone warren william and paul lukas before being consigned to b picture status the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex the characters are unarguably unusually well realized the direction rather good and unusually swift paced and except for a darkish b w look the film avoids the comedic asides superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries jack okey did the good art direction the music by berhard kaun is serviceable orry kelly did the costumes william reese provided the mostly indoor cinematography in the interesting cast powell is the philo vance of his time mostly sober minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to vance with his very professional timing the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul cavangh very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part mary astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved also in the cast were helen vinson as the villain's woman jack la rue ralph morgan best known as frank morgan's brother robert barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill archer coe and frank conroy as his likable brother with robert mcwade as the d a quirky and funny etiienne girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent the story breaks into four parts first there is shad doings at a dog show where vance coe and cavanagh are all showing west highland terriers cavanagh's dog is killed by coe to prevent him winning the title over his own entry the second portion of the scene involves a leave taking someone is confused enough by who has gone where after coe parts from his girl friend vinson to murder his nice brother by mistake enter vance to find out who did in archer coe in a locked room and how with the help of palette the romantic difficulties are straightened out the chinese servant is exonerated we find out who broke the expensive vase who will marry whom how archer coe was done in and why the butler did not do it but someone else with a good excuse did this is a more than good little mystery which skilled hungarian born director curtiz took quite seriously he used wipes swift cuts changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera work to achieve variety interest and a sustained pace many writers critics and experts myself included consider this to be the best of the vance projects although others are estimable as well
<START> this movie i saw some 10 years ago maybe more i took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in french sites the end is very surprising and intelligent i would like very much to watch it again because i think it's as surpring as the sixth sense althogh a completely different kind of movie
<START> simon pegg stars as sidney young a stereotypically clumsy idiot brit working as a celebrity journalist in this us comedy after getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected sharps magazine run by a reliably on form jeff bridges in new york it's more the devil wears prada than shaun of the dead the unlikely love interest is provided by kirsten dunst who works well with pegg for the laughs but they don't exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion br br sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine of course he's eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet sophie maes transformers' megan fox fans of shaun of the dead hot fuzz and spaced will wonder if pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent run fat boy run as one of the uk's best comic talents being ruined by the us br br all in all this is a forgettable comedy please come back to us simon we can forgive and forget
<START> the film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off the deaths are cheesy and are dumb but at least it had better effects then sabretooth i gave it a three because stacy was in it and i loved the movie sabretooth i thought it was okay but some deaths were off screen there was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off the end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them and seems like she doesn't need the the film is idiotic and a waste of time
