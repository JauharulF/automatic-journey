<START> i don't want to go off on a rant here but this is the worst film i've ever seen worse than the avengers incompetent directing disjointed writing and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout shot on very cheap video it looks like a high school project but without the emotion the lighting frequently looks like a single sun gun the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera but everything else about this thing is just awful the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution the techie elements are patently absurd and the editing looks worse than a rough cut it's not even bad enough to be funny it's just bad btw the packaging is intentionally misleading br br lion's gate owes me 4 00
<START> i have read all of the love come softly books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy's father comes to visit although in the book both parents come that is all the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes sad from the book that i just couldn't enjoy it even if i didn't read the book it was too sad i do know that pioneer life was rough but the whole movie was a downer the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great
<START> are you kidding that was awful br br but that notwithstanding i got given this film and 3 others and they were all on dvd the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwards br br and the ending well let's just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you br br 3 10
<START> i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about perhaps it was the disorganized storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i don't know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again i'm not willing to find out
<START> heartland is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department conchatta ferrell is just wonderful she is an example of the strong persevering people who came to wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land
<START> there are two kinds of characters on the shield people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes and everyone's only hope more than any other show the shield is about hypocrisy and self delusion unfortunately the hypocrites and self deluders are the shows heroes and as such have the typical genre fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again making fools out of all of their peers br br the show boasts excellent camera work the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb it really is a work of art to see unfortunately the story is a cartoony overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence rape and lies br br the hero who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing and someone gets hurt because of his actions he always blames the suspicious cop regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause every time br br like 24 this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season boring unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover ups br br most disappointing though is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth to and away form the characters on whims sometimes they want us to see shane as the enemy sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous sexual dynamo sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic br br none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends that's it it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth but then it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station right under everyone's noses
<START> br br the movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie itÂ´s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools 1 girl nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you canÂ´t guess coming in the movie toby mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest you canÂ´t get away from thinking of movies like x men batman and spawn all of those titles are better i almost walked out the last 20 minutes one thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation but not even that is anything to put in the christmas tree so my recomendation donÂ´t see this film even if you get paid for it
<START> what happened to these unlikeable people alan arkin was as usual unfunny and just walks through the role the kids are all a mess mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad mean movie if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction and not try in any way to do better this is your film all others take a walk read a book or see something else br br jane
<START> i have a lot of time for all the columbo films but this one in particular was extremely well written and the solution at the end very effective however my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film between columbo and the murderer i apologise if i've not remembered every detail of this exactly it's the most striking image of columbo i've seen the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered and into the room beyond which is lit up by daylight columbo is sitting in a high backed armchair facing the doorway and us contemplating the cupboard and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light there's no sound the camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him he's deep in meditation puffing gently on a cigar swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks then the dialogue starts superb
<START> i have just seen this film and fallen in love with it there is a little bit of something for everyone and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil when they are on the beach i nearly cried there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together this idea taken from several angles from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan i've always had a soft spot for the accent but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character the way this film was shot is also beautiful with the music backdrop of the open fields and superb acting all together this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions
<START> many people here say that this show is for kids only hm when i was a kid approximately 7 9 years old i watched this show first it was disgusting for me i talked with other kids about this and sure other shows and know what this was the measure of disguise whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness either on tv or anything else we said uh just like power rangers and laughed br br and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it i did not enjoy that viewing but it dawned upon me maybe i have not enough imagination it may be however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star
<START> a documentary about two rocks bands spanning a number of years brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure br br anton newcombe the main man of brian jonestown massacre is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues his friends and rivals the dandy warhols but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan newcombe knows no limits Â he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments writes and produces all bjm's music can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day has a prophet like obsessiveness with his own musical genius but is also a heavy drugs user flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life and can blow deals as fast as he makes them bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession Â they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable br br the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness Â but the warhols have something that bjm don't Â the ability to integrate their talents with common sense the real world and their market Â as a mixing pot of talent even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe and accessibility they are the very definition of 'cool ' dig follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy at one point newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act' Â only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday' and 'bohemian like you' newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana Â the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time let off with a warning and even allowed to keep the grass br br the wider appeal of dig is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music the downside is that it is still a documentary however intimate and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius and there are feint glimpses of this in the film but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this in the words of one of the band members in every spiritual tradition you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up newcombe isn't pretending Â but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime and dig has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius
<START> i am anthony park glenn park is my father first off i want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the amber alert system is a good one however the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible the major problem i had with the movie involved the second half with nichole timmons and father glenn park the events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct my father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up nichole without any intent to harm her at all he loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about the movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form the funny thing is that nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing the reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck my father was a landscaper the items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work my recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie at least the nichole timmons glenn park portion are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story the funny thing is that if the director would have interviewed any of sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what i have posted here
<START> i just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that i robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling too br br i find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is is depressing depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichÃ©d re heats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modern day uber action to smith's character a smart mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and a few others br br i robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but i don't think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards but very b movie compared to true winners
<START> there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkers screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son br br garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacher glenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama mary alice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertson mÃ¤dchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle thanks to a deputy's cat clovis mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son br br like many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mÃ¤dchen amick she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mÃ¤dchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms br br krige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arm a bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles' abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph experts br br the film is shot in a tongue in cheek let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home it's about the ultra violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris' direction and king's screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works
<START> vivah is by no means a classic however in the days of hardcore action path breaking special effects complex plots none of which bollywood has mastered yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times nothing more nothing less the music isn't quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesn't jar your senses either two songs stood out for me mujhe haq hai do anjaane while milan abhi aadha hamaari shaadi were hummable shahid performs sincerely shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small town girl to perfection alok nath anupam kher seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job suraj's direction is simple but effective the movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie
<START> on september 11th 2001 millions were killed but 2 819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner they were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings but more importantly people this film takes an in depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives br br charlie fineman played by adam sandler a former dentist living in new york loses his wife and three children on september 11th as they were on their way to los angeles emotionally annihilated by the events he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life including his in laws and his best friend played respectively by robert klein melinda dillon and mike bender he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson played by don cheadle who fineman doesn't seem to remember the two begin to catch up but fineman believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help slowly but surely fineman regains his trust for johnson br br while all this is happening alan johnson's life is going down the wrong path he is a self man dentist who helps start a dental practice one day a patient of his named donna remar played by saffron burrows attempts to make a move on him telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him this is an unwelcome surprise to dr johnson since he is a married man with two children as he is coming home from work on a particular workday he sees his old friend fineman and tries to flag him down he is unsuccessful but he gets another opportunity and persuades fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up despite the fact that fineman doesn't know who he is br br one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif one of fineman's physiological crutches is music particularly springsteen and other classic rock artists when fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music br br when the film was over i had me thinking how would i cope with the loss of my family how would i deal with such a tragic events it's something we don't really think about too often we always think they'll be there and we often take them for granted whether we intend to or not we usually realize how important they are when it's too late and a blow like that can destroy someone physically emotionally and physiologically i really don't know how i would be able to deal with something like that would i face the problem head on cope and move on with my life or would i just put my headphones on and block the world
<START> what a great actor to have in such an awful story br br the film and its production however is quite good even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol no matter Â see one cathedral you've seen 'em all sort of br br the story however is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything should he so wish with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy a teenager and finally as a man so much so in fact that he exacts vengeance at will literally over time he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot Â just by thinking about it br br the trouble with the narrative however is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi religious claptrap to produce a hodge podge theory about it all mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works Â and i'm afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing his very best scene however is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp witty and deadly dialog delivered as only burton could br br a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better though beginning with lino ventura whom i last saw in garde a vu 1981 as inspector brunel harry andrews as assistant commissioner the much under rated lee remick as dr zonfeld derek jacobi as a publisher towney and a few other well known character actors br br i liked the way the story was presented as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar richard burton the writer with the killer disposition up till that point it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick still it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer br br then they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes if you want a clue about what that is think samson and delilah 1949 from the illustrious cecil b de mille and how samson got the bad guys in the end and the very last scene is just plain stupid why because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar's rampaging could have been stopped absolutely br br shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie i guess burton really needed the money br br if you're burton fan then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above otherwise don't bother
<START> i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper friends spooking about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost 1945 but when i saw the next cartoon there's good boos to night 1948 it made me break down i couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing casper's fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldn't watch it again it's just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie i know it's a classic but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
<START> dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect this is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in german and highly simplified german at that perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles the story is of little importance anyway with the film succeeding on a cinematic level not a narrative one symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarr and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer vertov and riefenstahl if the film has any message to convey i think it's a political one bourgeois man is timid and impotent working class man is a happy productive creature and woman is the creator destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era and oh yeah hedy does get her kit off
