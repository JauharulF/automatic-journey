<START> this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers don't come up with their own plots br br a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called big what is even more annoying is jennifer garner's acting she doesn't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid br br from then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her wow how awesome but no her friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great idea br br there's also a dancing scene in the movie that i've seen a thousand times before br br i hate this movie
<START> this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these people there's just no comparison br br even three days after watching this for some reason i still don't know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence br br this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good it's an embarrassment i don't know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies br br that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad br br but this this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes before br br every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience br br but and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of drain o or i will do it for him br br if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this br br stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now
<START> i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man br br intriguing br br not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down br br anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town br br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women all 3 in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette right br br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10
<START> cute and playful but lame and cheap 'munchies' is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s i'm not much of a fan of the imitations br br first it was the excellent 'gremlins' br br then came the very average 'critters' br br lets not forget the lousy 'ghoulies' br br but the complete pits would have to go to 'hobgoblins' br br is there more br br now 'munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'ghoulies' and 'hobgoblins' actually i probably found it more entertaining than 'ghoulies' but i preferred thst one's darker tone br br from the get go it plays up its goofy nature which it's better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting alix elias and charlie phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok that's where the fun occurs mostly light hearted fluff though as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase it's silly but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as they're basic dolls being chucked about where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitude br br charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde who was in 'critters' were fair leads harvey korman was acceptable in two roles robert picardo also pops up br br amusingly low cut entertainment for the undemanding
<START> butch the peacemaker evidently after the violent beginning with spike tom and jerry all swinging away at each other butch calls a halt and wants to know why it's a good question br br cats can get along with dogs can't they he asks tom who nods his head in agreement mice can get along with cats right jerry nods no and then sees that isn't the right answer br br they go inside and butch draws up a peace treaty complete with professional artwork most of the rest and the bulk of the cartoon is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change of pace i found it fun to watch i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head br br anyway you knew the peace wasn't going to last a big piece of steak spells the death of the peace treaty but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom jerry clever humor
<START> let me say that i love adam sandler watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting br br when he raises his voice i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in br br reign over me is a great film a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene br br don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does br br adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic best acted film of his career but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film br br the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith br br i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is
<START> i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes's opening night it's the first movie of his that i've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale thus it feels more mainstream but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films that is perhaps what makes it so intense there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie br br it's about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front rowlands's character middle aged stage actress myrtle gordon cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage until she finds the right one it's a daringly abstract premise br br this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive yet it just might be the best thing for her it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown a withdrawal a cocoon a rebellion it all culminates into a meltdown cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch which is that early on she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true br br the last scene the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her is one of the most interesting hilarious hard hitting enlightening and enjoyable moments i've ever seen in a movie
<START> when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary br br although few lines it was kind of weird to see this movie no subs in a language unknown a friend of mine sent a vhs included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to english with her translation next to me i began watching this tale it is indeed a tale and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits i was stuck the colours that minimal acting well in most cases absurd comedy slapstick thoughtful beautiful along with a few other movies paris texas and nenette et boni this one is able to speak to anyone's heart without words whenever you get the chance see it whatever you do don't miss it it's a once in a lifetime experience oh acting is great the soundtrack is brilliant the story is simple and told a thousand times before but rarely never like this
<START> now this is what i'm talking about finally a low budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but it's still a damn sight better than 99 of direct to video dross br br the story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the boy's imagination is it an externalization of the child's emotional state br br some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide don't be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid it's one to rejoice in
<START> this is a horrid disaster of a film from beginning to end it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing the only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by streisand because the kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to the main problem of this film is that we never see kristofferson's character at his peak or streisand's character struggling the first should be seen in decline and the second rising the final streisand number could have been one of the greatest finales in film if it was directed and edited properly the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake had the band audience and wide shots of the stage been shown this number could have been dynamic and interesting this film must have been directed and edited by an nyu film school dropout the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions
<START> raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through victor a cocky teen but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family thats how much feeling this movie has one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real overall i give this movie a b
<START> this unassuming fairly routine series deserves credit in the tv history books for two reasons it was the first to win an emmy award for best syndicated series and it was the very first show to come from the fabled studios of republic pictures known for its low budget but high powered shoot em ups in the 30's and 40's br br republic was one of the first hollywood studios to make a leap into the small screen which was still in its infancy but the studios' tenure as producer of tv pulp fiction would be brief after this show they would later dabble with the other format that they were known for the adventure serial with commando cody as well as other series but like this one they didn't last longer than 39 episodes also republic was in its last stages as a studio it would finish out its tenure in hollywood as rental stages for several revue studio series such as soldiers of fortune the original dragnet and kit carson before finally shutting its doors in 1959 br br anyway stories of the century wasn't that bad of an oater its calling card was tales based on authentic figures in western history mainly outlaws like black bart johnny ringo john wesley hardin the dalton bros and the like the late jim davis best known for his role as the ewing patriarch in dallas put in an amiable job in the lead role as matt clark a fictional railroad detective who has to contend with said outlaws played by veteran and soon to be veteran character actors br br two amazing facts here the incidents would take place in different time lines some in the 1880's some at the turn of the century but clark never ages and also matt has the good luck to saddle himself with two lovely female detectives as sidekicks frankie adams played by mary castle and her replacement margaret jonesy jones by kristine miller the lone ranger could only wish for lady companionship you can only spend such time with tonto for so long br br stories of the century is a studio city tv production from republic pictures corp 39 episodes were made during 1954 all 39 of which are in public domain and on dvd
<START> anyone not aware of the 1973 original british lion movie ' the wicker man' would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression 'poor' and 'peurile' br br as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor br br from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island named summerisle the original to a near amazon ic colony off the maine coast of the us named summersisle the remake hardly hits the spot br br this is quite sadly a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public nothing more and nothing less br br gentlemen or given the reworked context of the film ladies involved hang your heads in shame
<START> this is probably the fastest paced and most action packed of the german edgar wallace krimi series a cross between the dr mabuse films of yore and 60's pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle it reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk's habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip set at a posh girls' school filled with lecherous middle aged professors and with the cops fondling their hot to trot secretaries at every opportunity it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically incorrect times there's a definite link to a later wallace based film the excellent giallo whatever happened to solange which also concerns female students being corrupted by and corrupting their elders quite appropriate to the monk theme the master mind villain uses booby trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a reptile replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences br br alfred vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show the monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip while appearing against purplish night backgrounds there's also a voyeur friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes the trademark kicker of hiding the ende card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here and there's a fine brassy and twangy score for retro music fans br br fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant eddie arent character in these later films instead the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of buffoon convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses unfortunately klaus kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things the krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant pop culture level which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers
<START> the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur effects br br it was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay interest br br and i am staying out of oakland there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight
<START> this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill br br the story revolves around iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley iris discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each other br br jane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect they aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles br br i won't give the ending away but it's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
<START> it is always a nice suprise when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job as most tv films this is a little tamer than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career all in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a tv film 7 out of 10
<START> this a superb self contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this law free world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact it's a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation br br highpoints include billy idol's british loutishness ben london's vulturine brassware kyle's squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies
<START> not funny how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funny br br it should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that's a debatable question br br maybe i'm doing it injustice maybe it's some sort of exercise some sort of art in that case anything goes never mind br br but these guys playing women with high pitched voices turned up noses come on not funny br br there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart
<START> amy heckerling's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the warner brothers' tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 keaton's mother maureen stapleton has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin yeah that's right vermin griffin dunne is keaton's younger brother turned district attorney glynnis o'connor his wife and marilu henner plays keaton's moll the film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film br br the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny piscopo does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito dom deluise ray walston as a street vendor alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film i think heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties' actual 1939 release date 1 2 of 4 stars
