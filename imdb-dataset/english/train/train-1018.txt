<START> this is an excellent film for female body builder female action fans i think that sue price did a great job in this film series nemesis 2 3 4 and proved to be a great fighter she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula nemesis 2 though not a film of great value and sue price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female body builder action well some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci fi films such as terminator or predator but that's not the point the point is that a puyn casted in that film a very talented body builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 a rather boring sequel and nemesis 4 a much more interesting sequel than 3 what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd
<START> i came to nancy drew expecting the worst because of everyone else's bad reviews i thought even though i don't read the books that doesn't look anything like the nancy drew i've heard of but i was wrong sure it wasn't a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become big screen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz she was intelligent conservative polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick what a flick and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was like freaking out go see it or be a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you a mistake i almost made i love it i wanna own this movie i love emma roberts now too she's like a mini bree van de kamp from dh love it love it
<START> i as a teenager really enjoyed this movie mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to be sure and rent it also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players
<START> quite honestly the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if i should demand a refund but since i hadn't paid to see it in the first place passes i figured i might as well stay and i didn't think it could possibly get any worse br br it did i will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane a motivational speaker with two phds the characterization was inconsistent for example lane despite his credentials is a complete nitwit then there's the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code also terrible action sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence that's cute for grammar school writing assignments but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture the pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds later the pacing improves but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around and as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even lane's young daughter ages that was disconcerting br br there are a few good things though the quality of the film e g lack of graininess is high and very attractive the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god finally to help him this proved to be quite exhilarating even to me someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie unfortunately it was followed by major incomprehensibility br br the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done michael ironside had nothing to do and michael york was just weird i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better br br in a nutshell the omega code disappoints definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars br br
<START> i remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it i guess i was a bit too old to get all excited and i was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy br br in the early 90's we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 ninjas i think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone br br many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message this one doesn't have any message at all it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes br br the movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to the acting is pretty bad victor wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here the short fat gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious the kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja tum tum was maybe the worst kid actor i have ever seen br br the movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review 3 ninjas yea you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously need i say more sorry if i spoiled it for anyone br br with all that said kids will love it this movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it if you don't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see if you don't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids i say kids because i think even the girls will like it i recall all the girls having a crush on rocky br br 2 out of 10 stars because i think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults this movie failed big time at that it is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and i would not allow a child of mine to watch it kung fu the tv series is on dvd and there's tons of great shaw brothers films out there why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 ninjas no no no never kick a man between the legs never thats so unninja like
<START> i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production but whether that's true or not it doesn't matter because if it wasn't then it should have been it's a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice robert shayne in bringing the dead back to life every time their subjects are revived they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table big deal carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it's dead and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion wooooooooohhhh that's about all she wrote br br for an ultra cheap monogram quickie this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted the funniest running joke in the movie is that the older doctor carradine constantly refers to his young assistant shayne as m'boy when in fact carradine was actually 40 and shayne was 45 when they made this
<START> i saw this film in its premier week in 1975 i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet i read and still own all of the bantam books i started going to comic book cons along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5 philip jose farmer's book the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story these stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at lester dent's aka kenneth robeson outline for writing them they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm it would have turned out better the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there but then fall short it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second string character actors guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film who all acquit themselves very well paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial all the rest have fallen off the map sadly i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction doc's answering machine at the end was a nice touch and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun
<START> it is a tricky thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be majestic and imperious and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line br br emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria but it's not as full a performance as i'd like no blame to her i can't help but feel like this is a mills boon novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions at least not to the full extent since she's y'know the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brown br br jean marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did c r a z y which was excellent and propelled him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies but while vallee wrote c r a z y this one was by julian fellowes and though i really enjoyed his gosford park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the governmental politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy i'm just saying
<START> i first saw this version of a christmas carol when it first appeared on television i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year with the exception of it's a wonderful life i consider this version of a christmas carol one of the best christmas movies ever made george c scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge scott does so easily the direction is marvelous with the fine sets costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time place and era depicted you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season
<START> i didn't agree with any of the theology in the left behind series but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them undeniably good writing and interesting story however i didn't have very high expectations for the movie there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a big budget movie so it was done independently and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show it just didn't feel like a movie it didn't have that movie experience to it if anybody knows what i'm talking about so the movie suffered because of that and the low budget poor special effects were another detraction for me br br on top of that i feel that gordon currie was woefully miscast as nicolie carpathia reading the book my impression of nc was that he was supposed to be this charming dazzling amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role instead they found some clay aiken pencil neck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy and gave him a really bad fake accent so that lost a few stars for me right there a movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to br br the acting was okay but nothing to write home about some of the scenes like one of the conversion scenes can't remember which one were real seat squirmers for me and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroom br br in short it wasn't a bad movie but it just didn't do it for me stick to the book folks it's much better
<START> casting bone to pick david jannsen was 38 playing the father of robert drivas who was then 31 yeah i realize he's supposed to be just out of college but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24 25 in the script that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine this movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking the weird hair drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well groomed hip cousin it and trendy fashions that went along with it if anyone remembers lv wasn't exactly london the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous his dad thinks he might be gay in a sad irony drivas himself died of aids at 47 and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue ahem as if one may call 7 years a gap sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino caesar's palace and plies him with girls including the horny for money edy williams interestingly enough the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him what nudity there is is awfully lame just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'r' rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system which then was g m r 16 and x the editing is horrible and there's stupid silly overdubs by the committee a late 60's neo avante garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later not to give anything away but they would've dealt with mr rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then a curiosity at best far from joshua logan's usual caliber of work dos dias now go watch casino again
<START> good engaging cinematic firefights great presentation vehicles are actually fun to drive fairly appealing multiplayer faithful to the movie and the list goes on br br bad main missions are a bit short br br this game defines what a good third person shooter not necessarily a spy game is great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer the hype this game had was lived up to and i personally think you should buy it and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one loads of fun br br the sound in this game is a rip roaring achievement from a few previous bond games and firing a weapon really feels like you're firing a weapon it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy br br all in all this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond nightfire game for gamecube
<START> excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras the film is much more than a commentary on globalization in fact it humanizes the workers in china the owner of the factory the bead distributor in new orleans and even the revelers in new orleans what stands out the most is the director's ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way his amazing access to the factory is another aspect that's intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside it's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated
<START> along with king of the rocket men this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties if i was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in br br someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the serials don del oro will make you laugh when i was little my nickname for him was mr dustbin head and it was funny upon being shot at he says your bullets can't harm me then he stumbles back seemingly less than happy i also like the way he dispenses with sebastian in the first episode br br i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back there are some good stunts and good music it has the ingredients you expect including water rockfalls runaway carts apart from the first episode with ralph faulkner the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as i remembered it and yes it features the inevitable flashback episode it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace padding and the other tricks if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william witney in a door into a fight out a door into a chase although there is only a small entry about this series in it
<START> spoilers seething with hatred and revenge half breed zach provo james coburn had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape what provo want's more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process during a wild shootout killed his navajo wife the former pima county sheriff sam burgade charlton heston br br making his escape after killing two prison guards provo makes his way towards yuma knowing that that's not just where burgade lives but where his his young daughter susan barbara hershey resides as well using his fellow escaped convicts to lure burgade into the vast arizona desert by promising them 30 000 00 in gold coins that he buried there provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on burgade but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are in not being with a woman for years as horny as a rabbit during mating season br br brutal and very effective western that updates the john wayne 1956 classic the searchers in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter charlton heston as the guilt ridden sam burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff charles coburn as the vengeful half breed zach provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict br br the man who escaped with provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand but to go along with him it's only the thought of them having their way with susan when provo gives them the green light as well as the buried 30 000 00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way br br also going along with burgade is susan's boyfriend hal brickman chris mitchum who proves in the end that he's as good as burgade is who felt that he just didn't have it in him in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense which in this case burgade lacks in doing it br br spoilers the unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between burgade and provo is almost too much to sit through provo who's hatred of burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death it was that hatred that bugrade took advantage of and after taking some half dozen bullets thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty as well as mindless lunatic away for good
<START> i am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have i reviewed so you can tell i am a major fan it's because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch i loved this man's films and kept thinking buster how could you well now that i think about it i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god awful episode of the twilight zone he'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well now in the 1960s keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series br br the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better the show is supposed to be funny but isn't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick do yourself a favor skip this one it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton's career
<START> naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task candidates being so abundant but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor this usually only happens when i see monty python's scott of the antarctic br br throughout the whole movie an overwhelming what the heck feeling firmly grasps the viewer i'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage it's supposed to be a sequel yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film the hero has the same name but this time alex is female although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing what with all the muscles and the barbarian nomad outfit br br there is really no plot at all it's merely a prolonged chase scene only it's so slow paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is there is almost no dialogue which is just as well considering the quality of it and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions without ever really explaining what it was all about luckily it never gets boring because there's something silly and phony going on at all times br br terrible movies are usually just tedious but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining rent this film or buy it even you won't be disappointed
<START> i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer which made it look like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors al pacino john cusack and bridget fonda and even though it was directed by harold becker who has done uneven work he and pacino did combine on sea of love which ranks among each of their best work but interference on some level for starters several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie and changing of tone subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller make this while watchable nowhere near as it could have been br br which is too bad because i really wanted to like this movie there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption and to make a complex statement about that corruption not the usual good guys vs bad guys and there is good acting here pacino and cusack are both very good and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career but fonda is wasted in her role having nothing to do and while there is merit in the central storyline when it turns to a thriller the movie loses its way briefly recovers in the final scene between cusack and pacino and then falls down completely in the end i wish i could like this more but no
<START> the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yu gi oh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to pokemon it's second movie is coming out late 2002
