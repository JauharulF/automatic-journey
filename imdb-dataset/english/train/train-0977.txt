<START> in my opinion this movie's title should be changed from only the brave to all about lane i went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome although i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry the acting in some parts of film was quite stale the performances of marc dacascos tamlyn tomita and jason scott lee were all great however the director should have never put himself as the main character in the movie sorry lane you are just not a film actor stick to what you're good at theater acting gina hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible she should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a miss nisei queen there were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful why weren't they cast for that role another major problem with this film were its action sequences the japanese american soldiers don't look like they were fighting german soldiers let alone anyone granted this was a low budget feature but since this was a war based film isn't it important to show some actually fighting this film was a worthy attempt but definitely not worth a major distribution
<START> when i'd seen the name of this movie i'd always thought it was a musical like the harvey girls it's not it's a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together no music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable br br it starts with patriarch james woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be barbara stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home br br we thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale and it is for a brief time then it turns into the story of cold hearted stanwyck's fight against lawyer george brent why is she so dead set against him well why else as we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money for her sisters as well as herself of course by marrying she hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer brent br br lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is well you know they had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived br br one of her sisters is in love with a painter named gig young who is played by gig young the other sister tries to take him away etc etc br br it is a shrill unengaging mess well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility
<START> first of all the release date is 2009 not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film it should be more properly referred to as earth 2009 secondly allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the planet earth tv series of 2006 br br i have not seen this tv series but learned here that this film is the full length version of this 2006 tv series i judge any film on it's own merits not by it's source i judge the results on their own and the results of earth 2009 are indeed excellent i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers that it's simply an expanded version of the 2006 tv series planet earth so what it doesn't really matter br br as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime i was astonished and highly impressed by earth 2009 this is the debut film from the new disneynature division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney's pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 1950's and 1960's br br cinematography film editing music score sound and narration are all excellent there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories what really sets earth 2009 apart is its' scope it literally covers the entire planet covering all seven continents br br after my first viewing it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create br br three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film br br earth 2009 convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december from the north pole to the south pole br br two special new high tech cameras were used for this film one camera has a 360 degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing 1 000 frames per second this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth 2009 especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world's highest waterfall there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary br br via cinematography music score and narration there is drama sadness humor and great beauty in this documentary with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration i consider earth 2009 as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made br br five years of hard work patience talent and dedication really paid off very well here this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world i predict an academy award for best documentary feature among other awards truly an amazing astonishing exhilarating and magnificent documentary film br br very highly recommended
<START> spoiler alert Â although i think this one was spoiled coming out of the canÂ it's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars from this studio made at this time period could be so awful but it is it is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense br br rich widower american aristocrat penn gaylord leaves his small daughter in charge and goes off to world war i where he is killed then we flash forward to present day 1942 and total confusion the three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years and some jerk named barclay is trying to take their home away from them this is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script more holes in it than the warren report what happened to the gaylord fortune if the will is worth half a billion why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on the munsters who the devil is this barclay clown and why is he able to take someone's home away from them the questions just pile on top of more questions br br the usually affable and charming george brent is playing barclay who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt yet no one besides fiona barbara stanwick seems to particularly dislike this cretin why none of these questions are ever answered we instead just follow fiona's life from one train wreck to another the evil barclay takes away her home her fortune and even her child what does she do shoot him set him on fire no too logical in a completely improbably wrap up this woman who's only prior romantic involvement with barclay was save for the technicality of marriage rape suddenly decides mid sentence literally that she does not hate him she loves him and they're going to live happily ever after all of a sudden for no reason in the world this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era yeah sure steal everything in the world that belongs to me and i'll fall in love with you on what planet does that happen i can only guess the reason i never heard of this film before i happened to catch it on turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today
<START> waterdance explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality masculinity and depression the experience of disability is laid open br br the diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined joel the writer raymond the black man with a murky past and bloss the racist biker at first these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries but retain their competitive spirit over time shared experience both good and bad brings them together as friends to support one another br br most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses headphones and curtains as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward br br the dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water to give up the dance is to reject life waterdance is a moving and powerful film on many levels and i do not hesitate to recommend it
<START> as far as i know this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s early '70s and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wiped br br series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety and i recently got the chance to watch it all the best part of 4 decades on br br after rushing home from school freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers slade and chicory tip and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat br br never mind the bad hammy acting the unintentionally amusing fight scenes plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean going yacht through and the frightfully frightfully rada accents of the lead players br br no forget all that because freewheelers harks back to a bygone dare i say golden age of kids' tv drama when the shows were simply about rip roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously before they became obsessed with all the angst laden ishoos that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over such as relationships pregnancy drugs stis etc br br no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of all pervasive political correctness the boss figure would be a black female one of the young male heroes would be a muslim the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all action go getter with an iq off the scale who'd be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury's deferential ankle spraining washer upper br br it's a show that's very much of its time but is that a bad thing i for one don't think so
<START> the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history take a well know genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one freud mention a few words used in the genius' works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away
<START> the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film alexander korda nearly went broke making this film br br according to the citadel film series book about the great british films adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle br br budget costs happen in us films too only cecil b demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film part of the way through the shoot korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk korda also finished the interiors in hollywood all in time for a release on christmas day 1940 br br the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography best art set direction for a color film and best special effects only miklos rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place br br the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart both belonging to duprez this was veidt's career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser br br of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that br br the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today it's an eternal tale of love romance and adventure in any order you want to put it
<START> go way back to page ten of this review section and work your way back up go ahead i'll wait br br done well then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in 'bogus' but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now love me later flicks br br bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion that worked fine for the original but obviously bombed in 1991 when no self unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80's as ted would put it dude this is a totally deep hole wanna play 20 questions br br they say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles and that certainly seems to be the case here here in 2010 those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that like it or not made us who we are if you're one of those who look at 'bogus' as if it were an outdated fa gs ripoff then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed br br in self referencing its own origins the star trek episode and and time traveling with a phone booth b t makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage quentin tarantino anyone i'm not saying 'bogus' is 'true love ' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snap shot of our society at a time before child psychology ritalin anti smoking ads terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear mongering br br so for all of you b t haters out there turn off your screaming trees cd get that hair out of your face go to the beach and lighten up narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate
<START> some amusing humor some that falls flat some decent acting some that is quite atrocious this movie is simply hit and miss guaranteed to amuse 12 year old boys more than any other niche br br the child actors in the movie are just unfunny when you are making a family comedy that does tend to be a problem beverly d'angelo rises above the material to give a funny and dare i say it human performance in the midst of this mediocrity
<START> many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanks philes out there that tom did in fact make crappy films i think bachelor party was great but that's another story the movie focuses on a dungeons and dragons style game that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness the story is charmingly early 1980s focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role playing games br br i however prefer to view mazes and monsters as the turning point in the whatever happened to chris makepeace story we all remember him as 'rudy the rabbit' in meatballs and as the hapless clifford in my bodyguard where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon few could argue especially those of us who read dynamite on a regular basis that great things were in store for him br br and then came rona jaffe the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace's performance in this is all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was vamp and that was 1986 he had a small role as sean penn's brother in falcon and the snowman but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes br br i can't in good conscience recommend this movie watch it if only to see a younger more idealistic chris makepeace before rona jaffe feasted on his soul
<START> 'dead letter office' is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented what's most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title there's no mechanisation whatsoever and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it's a shame as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry and there's some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else
<START> star trek hidden frontier is a long running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they're green screenin' it this doesn't take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a whole i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9
<START> this movie pleasantly surprised me it has a touching slightly off center approach that never loses your attention this is a movie i never heard about but if you want a sleeper this is it great writing production and acting i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful nick nolte sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous why wasn't more made of this movie
<START> i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
<START> he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong br br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book br br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all br br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner br br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur br br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie
<START> this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada yves p pelletier i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy but knowing he was a heavy cinephile was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque i had a positive feeling about this movie br br hell i was right right off the bat the scenario written by pelletier himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in pelletier's fashion it's a one of a kind 90 minutes jack in the box br br loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons by laclos les aimants consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who's who and who's writing to who on that goddam fridge which pops up in an interesting love affair br br great storyline great photography great quotations of other movies should we ask more for a first movie
<START> who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people when flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog so one can hear neither diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had the scenes of annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd this entire movie is a cartoon the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding the discussion by the black women after flipper's wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team is ridiculous the rampant racism might be possible to endure but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this 'movie' is too much it was a technically poorly made movie there is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making the sound track the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat i actually felt sorry for anthony quinn wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick his appearance in this is painful this is the first movie i have seen by this director and it will be my last
<START> funny that i find myself forced to review this movie but here i am br br i am reviewing it because just recently i have had the chance to witness the revival of r c sheriff's play journey's end on stage in new york at the belasco theatre starring hugh darcy boyd gaines jefferson mays and others as well as being masterfully directed by david grindley br br i left the theater shattered i am not exaggerating i was flabbergasted after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier's life in the trenches of the somme i speculate during world war one brought to life vividly by everyone involved i came out of the theater with the shakes br br mind you i am not easily shocked nor am i too sensitive i am a stage actor and a director myself so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects both emotionally as well as psychologically br br but what i had just witnessed came so much to life that i had chills in my spine as i left br br none of these emotions came to life while watching aces high the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen in cooperation with r c sheriff himself shortly before he died br br the screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france so gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with br br the only plus of the movie are the aerial battle scenes which look dated in their special effects compared to today's standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen br br granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of all quiet on the western front by erich maria remarque which takes place in trenches and not in the sky but that was the german vision on things if one would like to be picky on such things br br journey's end is just the other side of the medal and would have made it into a great movie if they had left it alone and intact br br the transfer on dvd is poor even though in widescreen and adapted for 16 9 tv screens the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater nothing more nothing less it sports various defects such as minor scratches and dots although the copy for the rest is clean br br if you want another wwi movie in your collection especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old timers then this is a picture for you but i rather would suggest von richthofen and brown as an alternative although that too is a movie filled with inaccuracies br br for the rest of you who love good acting and drama i would leave this one out buy the play go watch the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you but keep off this would be adaptation br br it is an anti war movie granted but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime ever br br the presence of actors such as trevor howard ray milland richard johnson and john gielgud is just a bluff since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie br br mcdowell the very talented christopher plummer simon ward and peter firth all deliver very weak performances not due to their lack of skills but rather due to lack of true and solid direction br br there are too many gaps in it and as said before it drags itself to the dubious end dubious because in the original play none of the men we come to know and sympathize with stay alive they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission in the movie they all die except malcolm mcdowell who manages somehow to stay alive another day being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause br br the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness you just hear the cannons roar the machine guns rattle and grenade impacts throughout the theater then suddenly total peace and silence the curtain comes up lights and here they all are lined up standing straight and rigid obedient corpses br br far more interesting and far more shocking than aces high finale which is also dragged by the hair br br it is up to you to judge br br for me if i had the money and the contacts to do so i would take the play and develop it the way it was meant adding here and there some action scene in the field just to visualize the outer horror and slaughter going on in the vasty fields of france around the men involved but then just strictly concentrating on what is going on in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the world br br want such a movie br br then ask for it br br this is not it
