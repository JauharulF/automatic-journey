<START> hitokiri which translates roughly as assassination a k a tenchu which translates roughly as divine punishment showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form do not miss this one or gosha's other classic goyokin hitokiri is not only one of gosha's best films it's one of the best samurai chambara films ever made and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exported br br be warned all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history even so the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers as per the norm for gosha hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of loyalty to one's lord vs doing the right thing however gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication that it's really the movie to see along with goyokin of course br br i suppose it breaks down like this if you want a simpler more action oriented tale you might want to see goyokin however if you want a more thoughtful multilayered albeit grim drama see this one br br ok ok essentially the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either 1 working to reform yet retain the tokugawa shogunate and 2 those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan of course those clans working for emperor meiji were often less interested in reforming japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the new world order ironically the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government it's ironic twists like this gosha's big on irony that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet br br what distinguishes hitokiri from gosha's other movies is gosha's mature sense of cinematography every shot is thoughtfully composed and much like kubrick's barry lyndon each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition of course this is typical gosha hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops including as with goyokin many riveting seascapes just watch the opening sequence and you're hooked make no mistake this is no english period piece hitokiri is extremely violent don't say you weren't warned br br what else other than cool camera work makes hitokiri stand out the performances seem to me a bit more subtle in this one katsu shintaro of zatoichi hanzo the razor fame turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist antihero okada izo katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain throughout the movie you're never quite sure if you're engaged or revolted by okada's character at the same time katsu's portrayal of okada's ravenous hunger for respect and his later pathetic attempts at redemption seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy sympathy of course after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in goyokin it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in hitokiri he's just perfect there's nothing more to say br br as a final note perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans don't miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio yes the closeted gay right wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he kidnapped in 1970 and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable for an assassin shinbei tanaka
<START> wow i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had br br his acting was painful to observe the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors heck even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend br br his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be ok br br watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster just didn't work at all
<START> the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv ch 5 during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a rankin bass production
<START> this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see it is painfully long and awfully directed i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end run time is way over 3 hrs which could have been edited to less then 2 hrs br br transition between stories is average most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out br br its funny only in pockets ambitious project and a below par execution govinda does a fair job anil kapoor disappointed me rest we as expected if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close
<START> bravo morgan freeman is an actor who researches a character he is selected to play before he makes a commitment freeman is a 'good fit' for this film like he was for driving miss daisy and he is not only believable but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety although there are no guarantees in life for anyone this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out in order to avoid getting stereotyping and it must be said that stereotyping has hampered or completely ruined a significant number of acting careers br br this is a low budget film that amazingly was made in a time span of only two weeks it is a film that is well directed and written by brad silberling the location manager chose carson ca for the film's setting and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film the editing is fair to good but a little rough br br silberling was the 'subcontractor' in getting freeman to do this film while the actor was in between film projects br br there is a good chemistry between freeman and paz vega a spanish actress and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members who are diverse and come from different cultures the film also encourages an understanding between people who not only speak two languages english and spanish but come from two different worlds of ethnicity race gender norms mores beliefs folkways principles and values the film strives for some honesty and arrives at some truth to maintain the film's integrity br br part of the comedy is that freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years in truth freeman is so in demand as an actor that he is constantly working br br the film offers an adventure of bonding caring sharing changing and exchanging and the film's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role br br if necessary tell your boss that you're taking a 'mental health day' and go see this film if you're able take your significant other or your family with you i rank the film a 10 out of 10 it's enjoyable interesting informative poignant and worthwhile
<START> paul reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie peter falk gives the performance of his life it is worthy of an academy award this was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year reiser's wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running tv sitcom mad about you peter falk did a masterful job as his dad and peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time the supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous elizabeth perkins it is a must see movie for 2005 we bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another we have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie we have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different
<START> this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney mardi gras film festival i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me br br i actually like films that take time to develop films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow stillness is good but this film though was just plain slow br br credit must go to the two main actors there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people misfits really come together in a very awkward way there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them br br i also liked the setting and the way it was shot it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters br br i just don't understand the ending what was the point of it all
<START> it was clear right from the beginning that 9 11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined however there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good or rather bad as pearl harbor it is a great luck that the first international release about 9 11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world br br i'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great youssef chahine's for example has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamura's has a really bizarre ending or that the segments are in the right order imamura's being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers should open the film not end it alejandro gonzales inarritu's should be the last one instead as it's the most impressive one but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers br br consider samira makhmalbaf's opening segment in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a one minute silence or idrissa ouedraogo's part which features a bin laden double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him i promise in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden br br there's a surprisingly good and extremely angry segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls our tuesday september 11 that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia this could have become a terrible effort in anti americanism but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritu's mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing and amos gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv hard to recognize but this one is a masterpiece of choreography br br all these different segments i haven't mentioned yet claude lelouch's about a deaf girl danis tanovic's about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica mira nair's strange but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9 11 and sean penn's with ernest borgnine yes ernest borgnine as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies but alas it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one film only effort and as the one of the few 9 11 movies made by then that don't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience
<START> randolph scott is heading into albuquerque to take a job with his uncle however on the way there the stage is held up even though they are not carrying a strongbox however a nice lady on board is concealing 10 000 for her and her brother's business and the robbers seem to know this br br once in town scott goes to this uncle about the job however he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk the typical bad guy from westerns you know the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything and it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother br br not surprisingly this is not the end of the problems just the beginning again and again intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle's opposition one trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend scott and his partners she's a crack shot and it looks bad for scott until he figures out why she's come to town br br unlike most later randolph scott films this one shows scott as a bit more headstrong man all too often in his films he's the last one to suggest violence but in this film he's quick to suggest a lynching screw the law let's have a hangin' and later he's quick to threaten the uncle what a surprise to see him as such a hot head though in most other ways he's the same old scott you'd expect br br as far as the film goes there's nothing particularly unusual about it gabby hayes plays the usual character scott is a hero the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and scott gets the girl despite this very typical plot it's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time br br by the way there are two weird scenes in the film first late in the movie there is a fist fight between scott and the uncle's 1 henchman lon chaney jr in it chaney smokes as he fights something i never saw before and i did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked second get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip now that was one impossible feat
<START> here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston br br the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shine br br matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails br br david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn't confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us
<START> how this film gains a 6 7 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 2 0 and clearly should rank among imdb's worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through br br i love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them since some haven't been widely released yet br br nicholas cage is a terrific actor when he is in the right movies time after time i've seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind numbing films like con air the rock and face off when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufman's adaptation he is an incredible actor br br bottom line i'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again
<START> no i haven't read the stephen king novel thinner but i choked down the film version horror movies are an acquired taste regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal in horror movies audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters in director tom holland's low fat but tasteless revenge chiller thinner nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them gluttonous new england attorney billy halleck robert john burke of robocop 3 has a weight problem although he rocks the bathroom scales at 300 pounds he appears happily married to a trim delectable wife heidi lucinda jenney of g i jane with a yeasty teenage daughter br br fat doesn't mean stupid here halleck displays his sagacity in court when he wins an acquittal verdict for sleazy mafia chieftain richie ginelli joe mantegna of house of games driving home from a victory feast billy hits an old gypsy woman crossing the street and kills her a cover up occurs and halleck's friends get him out of the soup the disgruntled gypsy father taduz lemke michael constantine of skidoo retaliates with a curse on the corpulent lawyer and the two town officials that exonerated him suddenly halleck finds himself shedding pounds no matter how much chow he chomps when he begs the vengeful gypsy to lift the curse the old man refuses desperately halleck resorts to richie while halleck struggles with the gypsies to remove the hex he learns that his loyal wife has turned his attentions to the town's hotshot doctor br br thinner qualifies as not only laughably inept horror flick but the filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women tom holland who directed child's play 1988 and scenarist michael mcdowell have served up such a slipshod script that you cannot relish watching billy get his just dessert and shrivel up thinner boasts few shocks and fewer surprises the filmmakers may have regurgitated king's novel but they have filleted whatever sense of horror and humor it contained holland and mcdowell introduce characters such as the mafioso then inexplicably let them off the hook one minor character shows up long enough to die and have a chicken's head stuffed in his mouth br br the stereotypical behavior of the characters may offend audiences too thinner depicts women as oversexed vixens and men as swine when halleck sneaks home from a clinic he finds his doctor's sports car parked at his house his suspicions ripen into jealousy and he cooks up a scheme to get the curse transferred to this wife even the premature ending lacks any satirical flavor oscar winning special effects wizard greg cannom of van helsing and make up artist bob laden do a fabulous job beefing up actor robert john burke to look obese they succeed too in making him shrivel br br only die hard stephen king fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook
<START> a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up br br in the case of the big sky writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize winning author a b guthrie in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation br br the epic nature of guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character boone caudill from a naive kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent in the movie version boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming br br intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie played by actor hunnicutt wasn't irritating enough so zeb hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voice over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and direction br br some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william wyler's ben hur is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself br br the story is dull and clichÃ©d and the characters at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie's literary vision and unfortunately kirk douglas' star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given br br if you can believe it the film version of guthrie's pulitzer prize winning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worse br br in my opinion the big sky further solidifies howard hawks' place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema
<START> where to start ok don't compare this film to fight club for a start ridiculous if it was even a patch on fight club the violence blood gore etc would be much more evident and realistic secondly this film is no football factory which is so much more real and danny dyer makes nicholas nickelby look like an embarrassment fair enough the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed with a decent ending i might add but the film on the whole is poor seriously poor as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film i disagree either a simple casting error or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through it was obvious from scene one some american geordie was playing the role don't get me wrong good looking guy who looks great with a skin head but no not a football hooligan i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was the 'fake steward' situation also when the gse are going to play united up north they go on the train expecting only 3 of them doesn't make any sense this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people in terms of accuracy did west ham and milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together hmm ten years ok and i'm sure 'bother' would be able to just waltz into a milwall firm pub basically a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence ross george
<START> almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china there are no fancy sets explosion or glamorous people only fine writing acting and direction hollywood take note br br an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual in fact he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable br br i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger hidden dragon as i don't particularly care for these frenetic films the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people
<START> i'm a fan of both actors singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer i just think this is a silly one after a long waiting time i watched it at last and here's my comment br br i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it instead of it my first applause goes to acting generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones as for hyde part his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor respectively as his character do throughout the movie i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget it still has brilliant moments but the real jewel of the film is story it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals an interesting note aside this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful not handsome beautiful actors of american cinema actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew yet original on it's own only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters but all in all this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes as for actors singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire action sci fiction and romance films 8 10
<START> i don't know why this has the fans it does and i don't know why i have even given it the score i have this is preposterous there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen but this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by italian standards not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances i reckon he turned up did a day's work and cleared off leaving mr d'amato to get others to fill in ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle maybe i just wasn't in the right mood
<START> la coda dello scorpione a k a case of the scorpion's tail was director sergio martino's follow up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh this is the quintessential giallo featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love twisty plot beautiful girls black gloves sharp blades and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation br br a group of gialli favorites both in front of and behind the camera work to make this one of the best non argento gialli around there's the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer bruno nicolai creating the music and a host of giallo stars and starlets such as george hilton character actor luigi pistilli and the fetching anita strindberg br br with all this talent behind it does scorpione deliver you bet the film works on many different levels it's a thrilling murder mystery a tense and violent horror film and a suspenseful thriller all in all one of the best gialli around br br martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli at some points in the film he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach for example there is a direct rip off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door that actually outdoes argento's flick br br are there any problems with the flick hmmm only minor ones first any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore but just before you fall asleep the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things br br also towards the end the twists get a little too bizarre i mean what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve if you don't play close attention to the dialogue you could easily become lost with the twisting weaving storyline br br but these minor quibbles aside la coda dello scorpione is a tense suspenseful classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans seek it out
<START> i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter kolchak was hard bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big city reporting and his gritty determination and wise ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable my personal fave was the spanish moss murders due to it's totally original storyline a poor troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth much to the chagrin of police captain joe mad dog siska wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder severn darden to droll understated perfection the wickedly funny harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system and is a series highlight kolchak never got any better timeless
<START> when i go to see a movie about zombie's i'm not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor that wasn't very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes in fact i left after the hottest one got killed there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that
