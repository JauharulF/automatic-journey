<START> i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely mediocre at its best the dialogue doesn't explain the story very well and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes there isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love also cate and heath's love seems very incestuous they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers i don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof br br i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like i said it's extremely hard to like any of the characters katherine heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasn't enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance johnny whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person i sympathized with as for erika christensen and mike vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatic br br i just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band mxpx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not i just pictured something so completely different
<START> this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of donnie darko did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson br br now i love mickey rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it don't get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them i don't know what to say about keira knightly i think she's a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in films br br all in all this film is bad thats it 1 10 j d seaton
<START> wow it's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago br br anyways i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl for the record br br the movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so clichÃ© and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists too br br there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower well actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho a good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and don't watch it
<START> a less than subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world br br diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the company line and condemns half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her school's 25th anniversary she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant br br however when the quartet update their play to parody sister mary's fallacious teachings the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts br br not recommended go watch the play instead
<START> another big star cast another glamour's set another reputed director another flick filled with songs that's topping the chart buster but alas what's missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture so much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it's' red carpet premiere a hype which went to an extent where anil kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge well anilji which movie were you speaking of well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people who have a total different stance towards life but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem that's love well indeed a luring theme but little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie these are kinda movies which i totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket i get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax br br the trouble begins right from the start the director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts some of the couples like anil kapoor juhi and sohail khan whoever the female is opposite to him just doesn't make any sense for their existence in the movie salman who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie well something like rahoooooool again as usual tries to be extra cool with his videsi kinda hindi accent hey sallu bhai now that aish is getting married at least go get some tip from abhishek to improve your acting abilities a simple striptease wouldn't make the movie a box office hit every time and anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch and smooching a girl of your daughters' age just looks as uncool as watching jack nicholson in a romantic movie and please nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot br br the other bigger flaw in the movie was that there wasn't any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks put together to form a sadistic plot of salaam e ishq bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like snatch memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline br br somewhere while i was evaluating the pre release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28 and 28 is considered a bad number in numerology but i totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its numerology defects but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie and when director like nikhil advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie any wonder wouldn't have saved the movie from bombing at the box office br br my suggestion for all you guys is please avoid watching this movie at any cost it isn't worth a pie that you pay for the ticket there indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than salaam e ishq
<START> yes chunky this is the nick name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with so lets get this clear right away from her first ingÃ©nue role in the get away 1941 too her last dallas 1984 1985 ms reed could never be described as chunky not this attractive and slim actress whose roles at m g m seldom lived up to her talents br br ms reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw ball' comedy clearly m g m was out of their depth making this type of film a type better produced over at columbia paramount rko and even universal neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre war wwii effort br br if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day it did fit into louis b mayer's 'safe zone' of none challenging family entertainment a form that could not stand up to the post war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision' loss of their theater chains television and would contribute to m g m s decline fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity 1953 and her oscar win as best supporting actress
<START> more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents 7 35 de la maÃ±ana is absolute genius what nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve i watched this smiling but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min nugget i was entertained but was disturbed at the same time not many people can do that in just 8 minutes it starts off simple enough a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place she sits down and someone starts singing from there the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe it is in black white but this helps with the feeling the film gives you this film makes you want to know more about the characters how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward i guess it like the old saying leave them wanting more nacho vigalondo is able to do that watch this when you can show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes
<START> i gave this movie a 2 and though i consider myself a science fiction fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on amc one late night and i'm glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few laughs but not much more br br the special effects are about average for the time period not awful but not great either of course we know more about mars now than we did back then but we really can't hold that against this film the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story br br there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail the astronaut's injury condition the city on mars the creature in the lake etc overall the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits complete with a cheesy ending
<START> please note i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mind br br although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 up through the early to almost the mid 30s a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film the lip movements in many and in particular this film don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms brooks could do a french film this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film and as a silent film this is would have been an average film with excellent camera work at times and some decent silent style acting br br the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot for a silent morality play circa 1920 it would have been fine but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary that means old not slutty a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancÃ© can't handle it she gives it all up temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end a tad melodramatic huh and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped br br finally the character of the fiancÃ©'s friend i found very disturbing and unreal he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean spirited were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused this seems to me that's what is implied and i don't like it at all br br there are far better french films of the era le million la femme du boulanger fanny regain and others as well as better silent films i just can't understand this film's high rating
<START> i saw soylent green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t v or video it was always one of my favorite sci fi and or charlton heston films br br recently the egyptian theater in l a had a twelve film charlton heston retrospective i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic br br charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great br br their chemistry together is wonderful the film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print fleisher really knows how to fill the screen and the cinematoraphy writing music used and everything about it works the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future just think how the world population grew the rain forest that disappeared resources used up green house effect getting worse since 1973 i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years its reputation should be better br br speaking of reputations often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor seeing him in el cid soylent green the warlord the omega man will penny and major dundee back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are br br
<START> zero day is a film few people have gotten to see and what a shame that is br br when i saw the end where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people then commit suicide and it made me grab my stomach i was shaking that's how strong this movie is br br the movie is amazing it's too incredible not to get a perfect ten it's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film it is not a budget which makes a film good it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good br br it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out it makes you realise the true horror of shootings especially if you were to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people br br i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it i am fourteen and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words it feels like you're watching something that actually happened
<START> this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the sugary sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers over protective fathers and bimbo sisters i'm almost surprised it's disney br br to its credit '8 simple rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more too many shows eg 'sister sister' and 'lizzie mcguire' think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard hitting this is a trap '8 simple rules' has avoided it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character br br and i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark '8 simple rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make cate's father a second version of paul hennessy
<START> having seen both fear of a black hat and this is spinal tap i can honestly state that while similar both movies are truly must see there will be many times in fear that will have you in hysterics it is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following fear will soon be available on dvd rent it if you must but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself
<START> it's very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera it's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad e g chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score 0 02 out of 10
<START> i've never been a fan of farrah fawcett until now she was truly amazing in this movie the emotion she must have gone through shooting re take after re take doesn't bare thinking about this was a very hard movie to watch the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i didn't find the conclusion at all plausible the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece i'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre this movie for me although it had merit just fell short
<START> this move was on tv last night i guess as a time filler because it sucked bad the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way not bad tits and ass though but the story is too ridiculous for words the wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth when it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill and the cgi fur looks like it's been waxed all shiny br br the movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killed slashed eaten next even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didn't do a good job at it br br don't even get me started on the actors very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds but then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do i sign up br br overall boring and laughable horror
<START> i think this one sucked on ice because it left the cube and gave us to much information as to the who's and why's the original cube never left the cube and it left everything to your imagination this crap fest however gives you it all and i didn't like it though the acting is solid i think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source so i recommend you stay far far away from this one and hypercube another movie i don't even want to discuss i gave it a 2 for the acting only
<START> short but long enough cat soup is a very wild trip to watch one day i was just searching though my on demand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape the whole time i was either vacant of thought or had a fleeting one which screamed turn it off but i didn't and actually i'm glad i did br br the animation is stunning very artistic odd and dark i personally loved it for the amazing animation but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself br br a young boy well cat goes in search of his sister's soul in the first part she's lying sick in bed and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper her soul is split in half one is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost br br then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me honestly i expect they go back and their world is perhaps slowly falling apart maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world's in first there's a giant flood and next it dries up into a bleak desert and then everything freezes thanks to either what is god or fate as you will see then i believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower after that the whole world disappears haha totally didn't get that but it sends shivers down my spine each time br br despite it's seemingly random scenes i'm sure there's a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research personally i love trippy stuff like this and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it but to some people it's probably not their cup of tea it comes off as highly disturbing so if you like your straight forward anime this is not a film for you if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie
<START> how did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast ridiculous predictable and thoroughly unbelievable this is well acted and slickly directed but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the all time worst thrillers i've seen in years amazingly bad and not in a fun way avoid at all costs even if you're a fan of someone in the cast
<START> now this is more like it the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid thoroughly enjoyable hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through br br seriously this is just full of great stuff brimming with creativity and it's less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time the scenes in hell are great and so are the ones in heaven there's really no shortage to the mad cap adventurous romp that this one promises and you will never see another movie like this even the hammy final act of the movie isn't as bad as the first one being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clichÃ© repertoire of family fun movie bliss and even keanu reeves despite looking about 30 isn't that bad here br br sounds like a good deal to me
