<START> an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv special but find out they still hate each other willy's nephew agent richard benjamin tries to get them to work together br br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its non stop one liners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and al's senility was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great tossing off one liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me it's worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just good not great matthau's character really makes this hard to love i give it a 7
<START> the wicker man starring nicolas cage is by no means a good movie but i can't really say it's one i regret watching i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination etc but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this instead here's five reasons why you should watch the wicker man even though it's bad br br 5 it's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution if nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based br br 4 for a cheesy horror thriller it is really aesthetically pleasing it's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery there are also many nicely composed shots it is a very good looking movie br br 3 nicolas cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature whether you're a fan of his or not it seems as if it's impossible for cage to play a normal guy there is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does whether nicolas cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch he is terrible in the wicker man but in the most wonderful kind of way br br 2 a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti feminist movie ever made see you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society also the similarities between this summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting br br 1 if you're reading this there's probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular a collection of highlights from the movie including cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous aaghh the bees my eyes line these scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety br br i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollars when you work that out it's about a dollar per reason it's a pretty good deal br br note the unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and it's better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from james franco
<START> i saw this film a couple of weeks ago and it's been stuck in my head ever since it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary to get the true story of the beales i had to wade through all of the dvd's bonus material and commentaries and search the web br br although the maysles and their fans not to mention edith and edie themselves bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous the sound even on the criterion re release is poor and difficult to follow although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film it's ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera's far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from 1972 four years before grey gardens was shot br br to paraphrase a review in the new yorker there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives and a documentary wasn't one of them br br as for edith and edie the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was where the hell is their family they were living in dangerous unhealthy unsafe conditions how is it that jackie o married to one of the richest men on earth or the wealthy bouvier family themselves couldn't afford to get edith and edie a decent home or at the very least hire a part time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both it's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family br br although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary bringing in the rich backstory and afterstory of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the 1970's
<START> weaker entry in the bulldog drummond series with john howard in the role usual funny banter and antics but not much plot barrymore gets something to do as the inspector swapping disguises to follow drummond algy and tenny on a wild goose chase mostly in circles perhaps the budget was tighter than usual to rescue poor phyllis who is being held captive by people who want to lure drummond to his doom for those keeping score in this one drummond is planning to ask phyllis to marry him and algy is worried about missing the baby's christening it's fun to see algy and tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at the angler's rest but little of it rises above silly
<START> this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity an artist's profound vision his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna blending his creations with trees white water dashing against rocks fields and rain andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature credit also goes of course to the filmmaker thomas riedelsheimer who directed photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing br br if you have any feeling for beauty nature and art do not miss this fantastic film
<START> i loved this film i'm a true tom hanks fan and i have always been impressed with all of his work from his most dramatic roles like cast away the green mile saving private ryan forrest gump apollo 13 philadelphia to his hilarious roles like a league of their own turner and hooch catch me if you can the lady killers big of course toy story but in this film hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen tyler hoechlin an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career i believe he will do great things paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen he is truly a legend we can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film but still helped make it great the beautiful very talented jennifer jason leigh who's performance in bastard out of carolina single white female i will never forget brings her grace to the screen as hank's wife in the film and does a superb job liam aiken is another found treasure in film he does such a great job with such a small role and like his roles in lemony snickets and sweet november and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance
<START> masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road cliff's airbag works ok he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didn't she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body abby's life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured horribly disfigured from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer get rich while abby's mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich save abby however abby has other plans of her own br br this american canadian co production was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series while i didn't think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i've seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same still doesn't come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution 2006 the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i'd say it's a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby's life the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the character's are a bit clichÃ©d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here there where it loses it's focus a bit i wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending br br director schmidt does a good job there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere out and out blood gore there are some fantastic special make up effects as usual there's shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images make up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser 1987 it's sequels then there's the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close ups of scalpels slicing skin open him peeling it off the muscle putting it into a cooler box very messy there are also various assorted body parts there's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked br br technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant as most masters of horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made for tv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one br br right to die is another enjoyable somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach
<START> i know that originally this film was not a box office hit but in light of recent hollywood releases most of which have been decidedly formula ridden plot less pointless save the blonde chick no matter what drivel feast of all saints certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion the film like the book loses anchoring in some of the historical background but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement and some of its tragic and funny and touching consequences br br and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert ri'chard cast as the leading figure marcel whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his 'coming of age ' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana at the apex of the antebellum period when i saw the previews featuring the dreaded blond haired ri'chard i expected a buffoon a fop a caricature i was pleasantly surprised br br ossie davis ruby dee the late ben vereen pam grier victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage voodoo creole aristocracy and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion hate love family and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us
<START> even 20 years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy sub machine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smoke painfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non existent then again ninja can't act save yourselves avoid watching at all costs
<START> liongate has yet to prove itself every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal i've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again and cabin fever is definitely no exception br br i couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad br br here's the plot guy cuts up dead dog for some reason gets infected by random virus transfers it to kids at a camp kids start to get infected and die town finds out about it and rather than help them kills them then the water is infected and everyone dies the end br br seriously that's the whole movie br br all the characters are completely retarded you don't care for any of them and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie we did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls t because this film will make you do that br br and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish and again why did this dog attack the girl why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him that was part of the two of their's plan wow best plan ever i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release i could barely stomach the dvd let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half it wasn't scary or funny or cool or anything it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to i don't know plant a tree or something it's more productive than this piece of garbage the acting special effects and script are a joke don't ever pick this up br br cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene out of 10
<START> i was told it was one of those either you love it or you hate it movies well i loved it obvious hippie era dated and easy symbolism and all so i probably have no taste at all when it comes to antonioni but this and la notte made exactly a decade earlier are my favourites among his movies so far made two years before i was born zabriskie point was supposed to have been michelangelo's great american epic but apparently it turned out to be a flop i really can't see why before watching it i'd read that it was rather boring so i braced myself for a very slow movie though i love me a slow movie for my taste zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it while watching it i made a mental note of how european it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight this recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in american society but then i watched l'eclisse straight afterwards which is set in rome in the early 60s and noticed that antonioni often included billboards in it as well after all the masterful use of landscapes architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an antonioni trademark Â this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states with more or less understated power and great visual impact he is virtually unsurpassed in this skill br br zabriskie point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s but never did mark frechette whom i'd already seen in francesco rosi's fine wwi set movie uomini contro had a very tragic life and died aged just 27 according to his biography page he donated his 60 000 earnings from zabriskie to a commune mark's co star daria halprin apparently also dennis hopper's wife later on has the stunning natural beauty and appeal of a young ornella muti Â one of those luminous beauties that don't need a shred of make up to turn heads like frechette she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star but at least she didn't die tragically most notably zabriskie point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few i've seen as well as a powerfully cathartic ending it may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes but i can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release never has an explosion looked so good and so poetic it seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos
<START> when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of the book i assumed she'd be playing tony roz or charis but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn't read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime br br the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz tony and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with in the film these women aren't people they are characters br br in the book zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes 30 45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi br br it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia which was so wrong zenia is a catherine zeta jones angelina jolie or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type she is a woman men can't not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way and once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment she's the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she's always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don't know her game br br in the film zenia didn't take charis's man the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed it's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movie confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all br br and roz's husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture which was weird since zenia took roz's business and home life in the book which is why roz hated her so much and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz's husband years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even at the party where zenia and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it tony's character was so wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book the film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers br br they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn't necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of researching this meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous which of course zenia bails on to hide zenia's body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they conspired together to do it and then zenia also managed to take all of roz's money in the process by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been br br if you aren't confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused it was terrible i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland br br are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of
<START> this is a comedy of morals so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything br br this film marvelously written and directed is a gem that shines perfectly with beautiful acting by all jean louis trintignant is exquisite as usual and romy schneider is a pearl perfect and glowing that is not to be missed a truly wonderful film
<START> the perfect murder is foiled when a wife played by mary ellen trainor once the wife to director robert zemeckis who helmed this episode who murders her husband with a poker has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit played by a deviously hideous larry drake she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse she decides to use an ax once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head to frame the killer for her husband's murder santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child br br this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old santa kills theme while also adding the oft used add nauseum woman murders her husband for a man she's been cheating with routine it's essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac there's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions not one of the show's highlights
<START> this film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene blends with the new york art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny this is torch song trilogy for the perky post teen girls that girl for our disaffected affected millennium times br br the dialogue is fast and funny and parker posey's costumer deserves if not an academy award at least a stadium wave of kudos br br of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey and she is perfectly cast like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often self referential and well posey but it all works she is a talented comedienne an incredible entertainer and this film entertains she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap and never lets it drop to the floor br br mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend on a deeper level this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care less in every sense of the word including about other people and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life br br the script is beautifully crafted witty and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt in a role that was much too one dimensional and heavy handed a more nuanced performance from her would have deepened the relationship between the two but hey this is comedy a surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and world vision is the fallafel selling boyfriend we should all be so lucky is he the one for mary or the one that gets away br br i rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history it is not a classic and it is not great art all of which get deeper and richer on re viewing like desperately seeking susan it represents something very true about it's time period but may become irrelevant with time still it has everything an entertaining film needs and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone
<START> although the recent re telling of part of homer's epic troy with brad pitt was entertaining once iphigenia with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity a chance encounter with this film on one of directv's many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems there is no glitter or bling in this movie just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil i think even homer if he really existed would be proud of this telling br br jlh
<START> this movie was a real disappointment to me i have been a fan of gram parsons for a long time and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very exited i got the movie on vhs when it came out and was sickened by what i saw this film wasn't about his life it was about the aftermath of his death i thought it would be a descent film about grams life and music but they had to make a film about his death i am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies i wanted a film about his life not his infamous death i was very disappointed i wish people would look at his life more then his death the only thing good about this film was its soundtrack this film is a disappointment to any gram parsons fan
<START> arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter br br he drinks quite a lot too and sometimes he is driving while drinking too which of course is not funny ever br br the movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality too john gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages talk about deserving an oscar moore and minnelli have their moments but its gielgud as hobson you'll remember the most
<START> following the release of cube 2 hypercube 2003 and playing off the alleged success of the original cube 1998 director ernie barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy the prequel cube zero br br deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution time and place unknown two low ranking operators wynn zachary bennett and dodd david huband sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers some of which are rigged with death traps told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection these observers have had no problem with their jobs until wynn a mathematical genius discovers that one of the prisoners a woman named cassandra stephanie moore never agreed to be put inside the cube suddenly it's realized that perhaps their jobs are not what they seem and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted br br for people that have seen and enjoyed the original cube this prequel will probably not be to your liking it's not that the story does not have potential it's simply that the first cube film never needed to be expanded on standing alone it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message it was also nicely self contained the problem with cube zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing br br what this new film has to offer which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil certainly are good questions to be raised but probably should have been done so on their own merits rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations br br having said this the other traits of the film such as acting and direction and writing are not awful there is a bleak dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'the matrix' and 'dark city' and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube unfortunately for barbarash these are not enough positive qualities to save it
<START> a question for all you girls out there if a man you ve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you d phone the police yeah that s what i thought so i couldn t swallow the idea of marti gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of connor hill br br mild spoilers br br this is a really dumb story connor hill s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor phoning marti so he can have an alibi but there s a massive gap in logic here couldn t connor have employed a hit man something the prosecution seem to have ignored and wasn t there any forensics at the murder scene so why does the whole trial rest on connor phoning marti at the time of the murder dumb dumb dumb and it s as predictable as it is brainless br br my abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter olympics marti gerrard is a really crap downhill skier
