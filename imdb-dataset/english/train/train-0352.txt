<START> this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene i think the transvestite poodles did it for me or better yet her talking tongue or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat decisions decisions
<START> this snarky homophobic thing was dated in 1976 it seems particularly mean spirited now filled with gay stereotypes and characters that are meant to be laughed at rather than with redd foxx does his standard schtick michael warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character and pearl pearl what were you thinking pearl bailey deserves far better
<START> fantastic mr fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book wes anderson directs and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film while i respect what anderson an incredibly talented man did the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man and if this happened to be a bad film it would be his first bad film just like when you go to school and have your first bad day this is anderson's first bad day in film making so i am going to let him off easy i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it and the animation is nice but the film gets progressively harder to get into leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening the characters are good also jason schwartzman voices mr fox george clooney 's smart ass son ash and especially engaging the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along i'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film but for now i'm sorry wes anderson this film of yours was a big disappointment
<START> i found this movie to be exciting right from the start like a spielberg movie is and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was br br right from the start before the opening credits the action starts bringing with it immediate suspense br br the two main characters are very likable i have trouble liking any of the baldwins due to alec's extra curricular political activities but william was not too bad in this movie br br there were several highly unexpected twists which contributed to the enjoyment br br there were unfortunately many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack something like 19k hz i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set
<START> if you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster the deleted scenes are priceless i don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie it can't be because of time since the movie is only 101 minutes long morgan freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long jim carrey needs meds
<START> this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who don't understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now
<START> i knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but i'm glad i didn't spend 9 50 to see it in the theater
<START> rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to dolemite this entry is filled with the requisite rudy ray moore raunch humor and martial arts rudy eludes a crazy red neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where rudy dives down a steep hill see it for laughs and for a brain blasting hit of blaxploitation magic
<START> i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released in all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode 3 denial anger acceptance this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos his name was brendan filone he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang in the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos brendan filone is 1 for me and my 2 most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him my 3 most favorite character is sean gismonte who was killed right after shooting christopher and finally my 4 most favorite character is chucky signore one of uncle junior's henchmen he was killed on a boat by tony all the awesome characters are dead that's the only bad thing about the sopranos all the cool guys always get killed you know what would be great to change about the sopranos they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris tony uncle junior silvio and paulie because they need to get their revenge brendan filone shall strike back 1
<START> fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any cuter all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp of course in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey but that is why i love romantic comedies one can just totally forget reality and have a good time nice film damn meg is a babe eh
<START> some time in the late 19th century somewhere in the american west several cowboys in need of money go on a buffalo hunt the group's leader believes that buffaloes are too numerous for the hunting to have any impact but the more experienced hunter has seen how quickly the population can collapse and he isn't so sure featuring buffalo herds living in south dakota and showing film of actual hunting the movie's introduction explains it as necessary thinning of the herd the movie does an excellent job of presenting us with the plight of the buffalo and its effect on native americans without ever getting preachy about it br br the real story however is about the dysfunctional family which is created by the small group formed to do the hunting the father figure is charlie a violent man with a short fuse sandy his brother is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle a half indian boy who hates the fact that he looks entirely caucasian takes the role of adopted son the grandfather and moral compass is an alcoholic buffalo skinner charlie's wife is an indian woman whose companions he killed after they stole his horses br br charlie is clearly the most interesting figure he is mean and insulting towards everyone around him yet at the same time he knows that they are the only family and friends that he has he expects the abducted indian women to hate him then accept him but he doesn't know how to react when she refuses to do either he's the one who put the family together in the first place but he's also the one who is fated to ultimately destroy it br br this is all very similar to the classic red river which also features a family of sorts being torn apart by the increasingly violent and alienated father figure as one might expect this movie suffers by comparison the plot is not as focused on developing the characters and family dynamics and the direction fails to keep all of the scenes working towards this common goal charlie is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family on the positive side however the message surrounding the buffalo slaughter adds an extra dimension to the film and its conclusion is far superior to the hollywood ending which was tacked on to the end of red river as a result the last hunt is an interesting and entertaining film very well made but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a classic
<START> for all of the hype about this film i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think and although a bit slow at times the first 90 of the movie is quite good with more than a few old time scares that make one jumpy and unsettled i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes where dark remains fails however is in its climax the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and the answer i was seeking most what really happened to emma was not elucidated upon the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best and in the end i felt very cheated what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending
<START> documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twink twink twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical hardships alone are just not that interesting
<START> i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings it's trippy nighy was fab in his role nail nailed it beano was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet aubrey's performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought to i've told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy nail's character it's supposed to be rock roll not the phantom of the f g opera
<START> spoilers br br i shoulda figured the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen this one is much worse makes no sense thrown together plot all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them br br it had to of been a student film that musta gotten a c grade br br 2 10 br br quality 1 10 entertainment 6 10 until i found out it wasn't going to end the ending made no darn sense br br replayable 0 10
<START> cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw and to me it is timeless it is a lovely looking film with gorgeous animation my favourite animation scene was the dress scene i just love those mice the songs are also lovely not as good as snow white's but they are a delight to sing and are reminiscent of tchaikovsky a dream is a wish and so this is love are standouts the characters are also a delight cinderella is idealistic and strong and the mice provided great comic relief the stepsisters were also well done as well as lucifer but i loved the stepmother the best she was really evil in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother it is true the movie drags slightly with the antics of the mice but they were genuinely funny so i don't care i don't think it is overrated underrated don't you mean it rarely plays on television but the really bad sequel does on cinemagic on a regular basis if you want a great cinderella adaptation try the wonderful ever after or the lavish slipper and the rose which isn't as good but whatever you do avoid the sequel which i have the mistake of owning because you'll thank me 9 10 bethany cox
<START> in light of the recent and quite good batman the brave and the bold now is the time to bear a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of batman being a huge fan since the first revival by tim burton 20 years ago i have been able to accept different tonalities in the character dark or campy this one is just not credible too many effects poor intrigues and so few questions what is great about batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality detective crime fighter playboy philanthropist etc the batman shows him only in his karate days and by the way how come the penguin is capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air regardless of his portly corpulence and look at the joker a mixture of blanka in street fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man what batman fan could accept such a treason not me anyway batman is much better without the article in front of his name
<START> avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie example the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear a cardinal sin in a french film br br this film attempts to combine western drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic what well consider this the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed br br someone should do a 'what's up tiger lily' on this bomb rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it heck it's almost that now btw gerard depardieu and carole bouquet both known to american audiences have roles
<START> this movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen br br four of the more important mexican directors of the last times approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him br br with actors little known but that interprets of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased but i consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the mexican
<START> i sat glued to the screen riveted yawning yet keeping an attentive eye i waited for the next awful special effect or the next ridiculously clichÃ©d plot item to show up full force so i could learn how not to make a movie br br it seems when they set out to make this movie the crew watched every single other action science fiction shoot em up good vs evil movie ever made and saw cool things and said hey we can do that for example the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking is the one car the protagonist an attractive brunette born of bile is thrown on to the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements for example the antagonist a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck you know they are already dead then the guy protecting the vip says under no circumstances do you leave this truck do you understand me he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies he gets whacked in an almost comically clichÃ© fashion then for no apparent reason defying logic convention and common sense the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense transparent acting distanced me from the movie as well as bad camera work and things that just make you go wow that's incredibly cheesy shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1 because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience sex appeal
