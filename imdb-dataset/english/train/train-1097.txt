<START> laughter is a state of mind says the tag and i hesitate to comment on barry levinson's what could he have been thinking during the making of toys when he watched the rushes did he see a successful funny fantasy if so then he's working on a different plane than i this is an excruciating picture one in which the production design is 90 of the thing and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment robin williams and most especially joan cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies there's nothing remotely funny satirical or slapstick wise on display here it is uniformly draggy ugly and one of the very worst big movies ever made no stars from

<START> a killer wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat is killing the friends of hollywood producer shawn banning danny wolske who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest perhaps the psychopath is newly hired maddy dabbie rochon an attractive raven haired beauty with a troubled family past plagued with nightmares shawn and his friends play a practical joke on maddy concerning a supposed murder club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill when maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person she finds that shawn's pals were jerking her chain but shawn and his comrades are concerned about maddy's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities deciding to wait on a definite decision each member fall prey to the white masked psycho with maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before or is someone else behind these murders low budget slasher executive produced by charles band with gore murders that fail to convince plenty of tits on display and allen nabors goofy character chris might entertain those with low expectations the murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing a neck sliced an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape an ax buried into the back of a male victim and to top it all a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax for added effect the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks there are enough plot holes to drive a truck through such as why maddy has nightmares of murders she didn't commit how she could murder someone so violently with blood all over her winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her and how shawn could go so long allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn't exist br br what bothered me the most was the film's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone later proclaiming it to be an accident the film builds maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past her family disowned her for an abortion she has black outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact in a lot of slashers the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring but this film goes out of it's way to point the finger at maddy when the twist occurs we're left rooting for maddy yet we know she's not right in the head it's a tough sell caring for this chick she does look great in a man's army shirt though and rochon isn't afraid to let her puppies breathe either low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite brinke stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what maddy did calling her a murderer as beloved troma producer lloyd kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about cult siren julie strain has a minor cameo showing her tits of course as the opening murdered male's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer oh and check out the office for which shawn works you'll see a lot of full moon posters and art work spread throughout the walls
<START> i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting the script the direction and the general feeling of this movie it's been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter reflect from sadness and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work we need more movies like this mike binder are you listening

<START> straight to the point the groove tube is one of the most unfunny unclever and downright horrible films ever made this comedy is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it's almost incomprehensible that it was even made i said almost because there are fans of everything after all br br this film isn't even good bad or enjoyable bad to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as plan 9 or robot monster would be a crime to those films films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of but this film is so bad so poorly made acted and scripted and so incredible stale that there just isn't even a trace of camp or schlock to be found br br even though this was made before saturday night live premiered comparisons were probably inevitable i'm not a big fan of snl but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find and man that's bad just to keep the men viewers from leaving shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often but poorly filmed breasts from 1974 aren't going to excite anyone these days truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep inducing excursion i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either br br a man named ken shapiro made this film i swear to god any ten year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever it's just downright unreal this is truly an unbelievable film the jokes and gags are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad's porno mags out at night won't laugh br br i will give this film one thing the very last sequence the dancing man sequence where a guy shapiro on the streets of nyc dances to a tune is easily the best thing in this horrible film not that the dancing man sequence is that great either it definitely has its moments of not being clever as shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song but it actually was somewhat watchable the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film no wonder shapiro put this sequence last again while not so great itself it easily beats anything else in this film br br otherwise this film is such a complete piece of crap it's unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless the name of this film should have been ken shapiro's craparama it's amazing that this was made but many truly talented filmmakers can't get in however i will say that i bet the geniuses at nyu would love this movie total garbage
<START> this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl br br most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story
<START> i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie except when the bras and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if i'm correct ralph bashki did that movie too it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streets jobs etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man
<START> it does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people first off not many seem to have seen it in the first place i just bumped into it by accident and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much br br well i did i usually tolerate gere for his looks and his charm and even though i did not consider him a great actor i know he can do crazy pretty well i liked his mr jones but this performance is all different he is not pretty in this one and he is not charming his character is completely different from anything i had seen from him up to that point old ugly broken determined and gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully i guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead think hopkins as hannibal lecter or washington as alonzo in training day that is how good gere was here br br the rest of the cast were fine by me too i guess i would not have cast danes in this role mostly because i think she is too good looking for it but she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a gere in top form which is no small feat strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her i actually think she owns the key scene with gere and danes and that is quite an achievement br br so what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting the story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mm ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who dunnit and also like silence of the lambs adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of gere's character all that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life that's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them br br direction and photography were adequate i could have done without the modern music video camera movements and cutting but then i am an old curmudgeon and it really wasn't all that bad in fact i think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isn't a happy one br br worth seeing
<START> this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented br br perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him
<START> at least something good came out of damon runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia guys and dolls the seemingly indestructible stage musical was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l mankiewicz all about eve in a colorful enjoyable movie that featured an all star cast including vivian blaine from the original broadway show jean simmons whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in roman holiday and two of the all time great leading men frank sinatra and marlon brando both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor from here to eternity and best actor on the waterfront and were on the top of their game one listen to brando singing luck be a lady tonight speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson who brings down the house with sit down you're rocking the boat the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters the film has a bright cartoonish look anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s the characters speak in a stylized patois apparently based on yiddish idioms although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated it's all great fun and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes
<START> this is one of the few films where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book the story is clear accessible amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional i adored the cyclical rendition of 'the old home guard' and the charming 'portobello road' a great combination of early animation real actors techniques which though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece the background of the second world war worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories br br an often far too underrated film it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages the performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed guaranteed to put a smile on your face
<START> i have to admit i don't remember much about the characters or the story though i'm not sure there was one i was soooo irritated by this movie that i had a bit of a hard time focusing on it how can you name a movie keys to tulsa and then film it in texas the flat desert country around arlington i think that was the location in no way resembles the green rolling hills around tulsa and a celebrity in tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in obviously no one in the movie has ever been to tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it hadn't anyone at least seen rumblefish or the outsiders i know this sounds picky but i can't help it i watched this because i love james spader and i usually find eric stotz interesting but even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering and mean story of self involved people who are not in tulsa i'm sorry it can't be more expensive to film in oklahoma what if to live and die in la had been shot in toronto would that suck well so does this
<START> italian born eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl an ultra modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods it's winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house but also that of eleonora as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair br br what was i expecting a thriller indeed but it wasn't quite so that's just the advertising on the package for ya i'm quite perplex about everything the title the story and the motivation so how to classify it well this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound story of alienation possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals co writer along with william dafoe and director giada colagrande's art house film is just too clinical distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story which it leaves you questioning what does it all really meanÂ although when its sudden conclusion materialises you'll thinking why should i actually care what we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments but more so make for an leaden experience as it never delves deep enough like it believes it does the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic they are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh but it's never fulfilling and i thought there'll be more to it then all of this dreary lingering colagrande's direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines but everything feels like it's in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views most of the action stays at the one locationÂ the house camera work is potently taut but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes giada colagrande plays it sensually and william dafoe sleep walks the part he looks dog tired while seymour cassel pokes his head in now and then br br just where is it heading is anyone's guess well that's if you can wait around for it i think i'll give it the benefit of the doubt as it's definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film
<START> i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn't expect a fundamentalist christian film br br the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being our hero who is a bible professor from the 1890s eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil jesus is nowhere to be found this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg wells style time machine the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film earlier or perhaps immediately later can't remember for certain our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful br br in any case that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time so if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as i don't think there's any evidence and none was offered for the physics of time travel in the bible so immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there but never mind br br after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date it's just two thousand and honk some of the shock went on a little too long though for instance the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van he sticks his head out the window like a dog might is scared by the headlights and the starting engine etc that seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic in any case that's easy to ignore the rest of the tech shock was well done especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote br br unfortunately our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful but mostly was just more of the same a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy go figure and investigate his name they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is the movie frames these guys as non believer bad guys for being skeptical br br just before the professor is to head back to his own time he is confronted by those two men in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away he eventually breaks into an almost insane like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him just in time he's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about br br the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self proclaimed and most likely false prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god given knowledge that was stated or even hinted at br br as i understand it revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying and failing to send a bible into the future first 2080 then 2070 etc as the scene fades out clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times which he shouldn't be able to know essentially the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only it means there couldn't ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know the entire movie's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it's own credibility in the end
<START> the premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the united states this was a highly combustible scenario in america whereby two entirely different cultures collided what justified such heinously depraved actions anyway as this film presents the scene while hickock and smith drank these two men were not intoxicated nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation basically these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect anytime past 1975 we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment however this incident takes place in 1959 this dreadful revelation sideswiped us and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics with the recent release of the movie capote based on truman capote who was the creator of the documentary in cold blood the american people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film robert blake played the role of perry smith one of the villains in this movie this is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life in cold blood centers on the element of the unexplained there was no vengeance involved there was no material gain to be acquired there was no potential for social advancement here either this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means the situational diatribes which hickock and smith lamented about were always ambiguous under the circumstances why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent kansas family will geer grandpa walton plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness his argument is thoroughly convincing his contention being these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours this is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime it was capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american public's attention as it turn out it was a harbinger of things to come in cold blood did just that this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960's such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the future br br truman capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book which was a best seller and with this documentary as well the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson as well as people like john forsythe was incredible the director richard brooks cat on a hot tin roof blackboard jungle elmer gantry and key largo to name but a few was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie i think that in cold blood is one of the best films in the history of movies the film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level this movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence our nation's ideologies are incredibly different now than they were in 1959 this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system i recommend to everyone that they see this movie in cold blood was the focal point to the film capote think about it making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in hollywood in the case of in cold blood it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant intellectually elevating and of course it goes without saying in cold blood was utterly spellbinding as well as a totally remarkable movie
<START> i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and the witches' mountain el monte de las brujas is something like the 17th movie in the set br br the movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all the plot was incoherent the dialog seemed improvised the acting was poor the characters were unsympathetic br br the best scene is the beginning with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter however the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie is the lead character mario who has the most stupendous mustache ever but that's it br br the film was not effective on any level the music was too intrusive the lighting was very dark so that some scenes are almost completely black it really is barely watchable what more can i say
<START> when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show salem the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good i'm not a fan of when they started introducing brad and dreamer cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if you're gonna have new people at least keep them i didn't like josh he was a tw t i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of libby it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years and mr craft as well if him and zelda got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into roxie miles morgan's house i didn't like theses people either it didn't really seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they're own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re runs were back and i was like whoo hoo lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now she's working at some magazine shop so they're putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if they're in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it zelda was reduced to a candle and she's about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it's appealing self through the seven years was salem the cat
<START> 0 5 10 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldn't say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
<START> the female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre she was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter this should have made the police suspect her i would have been inconsolable in the identical situation she seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter it was as if she did not want to even be in the movie jennifer aniston would have played the part better and it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject everyone else was excellent i don't know where the lead actress is but i hope she got some acting lessons
