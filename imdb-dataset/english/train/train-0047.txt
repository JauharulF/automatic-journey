<START> my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral palsy in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled and i still think to this day that nobody is or ever will give a damn about her and her condition then i saw this film br br i knew what christy's family was going through but they were lucky christy could talk he could communicate and he had artistic skills my sister can walk but she can't utter a word and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister and the ending to tell the truth made me cry and i've seen shawshank this film is seriously underrated and it shouldn't this movie tells people something that people should be proud of their own lives thinking you can't write well this guy wrote with his foot thinking you're not attractive this guy got turned down by lots of girls because of his condition not the fastest runner christy couldn't even stand up br br my point parents of young children i suggest your children watch this movie with you so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair they don't stare at them like they're aliens my sister got millions of stares and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people this film will teach people that people who might not seem normal are people too 10 10
<START> back again in scotland lassie is again on trial for her life because the faithful dog sleeps on her master's grave she must be put to death according to law oddly it is also explained that lassie had no legal owner which is apparently also against an old scottish law if after three days no owner is located dogs must be destroyed edmund gwenn as john traill pleads lassie's case which leads to an extended flashback showing lassie's adoption by donald crisp as john jock gray br br although it's based on an interesting original story greyfriars bobby challenge to lassie revisits several earlier lassie situations and it does not improve upon them comparatively speaking this one is sloppy and unexciting and it's a disappointing follow up to the sun comes up 1949 geraldine brooks as susan brown and several of the other performers may be charming but can't elevate this one little jimmy hawkins from it's a wonderful life is among the notable children supporting lassie much later he will grow up to marry dark shadows ' bewitching angelique lara parker
<START> the one and only was a great film i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv i am an independent professional wrestler and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler now this film was made 4 years before i was born but i don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much sad funny and all around great 10
<START> well i wasn't sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film br br i think alison lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is ok and also that hospitals doesn't help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why i'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
<START> hi everyone if you saw singing in the rain you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain you also remember the dance number of donald o'connor make 'em laugh if you saw royal wedding you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling if you saw jailhouse rock you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself br br that is what is missing here there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation the closest was chuck mcgowan's i can do that the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film richard attenborough was to blame for this failure he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing br br yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at it does not work here br br the cast was good except for michael of course a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production but someone should have thought about how to film it br br next time they do one of these i hope they call me first br br tom willett
<START> i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago and recently watched it again sans commercials on sundance i was impressed the first time and found it even more engaging on second viewing yes some of the segments are far from perfect amos gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb but taken collectively 11 09 01 is a total success best of show shohei imamura's amazing final segment which contemporary critics such as the thick witted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists' but now stands revealed as a masterful anti war polemic samira makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9 11 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan and idrissa ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for osama bin laden a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama youssef chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and al'qaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia and though sean penn's character study seems out of place it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film making all in all essential viewing and a darn sight better than oliver stone's reactionary world trade center
<START> ah noir my favourite genre otto preminger's follow up to laura is a film noir set in a postwar new york where corruption and violence run rampant it stars dana andrews as sergeant mark dixon a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors br br when he accidentally kills a murder suspect dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife the beautiful morgan taylor of course in typical noir fashion things quickly go down hill br br while the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom like most great noirs it is also wonderfully paced sucking the viewer in right from the start br br still like most of preminger's workmanlike films it's not something i'd watch again it lacks the verbal wit of wilder the visual flamboyance of hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of welles like lang's later work sidewalk feels very much a clone of what a noir should be instead of something really artistically genuine br br thematically the film is nothing special it's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal in one scene dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook the film flirting with the notion of predestination but this one scene is as far as otto goes or dares to take his ideas br br the camera work is likewise disappointing there's no intelligence in otto's camera no effort is made to assign the camera to anything it doesn't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step by step police procedural it's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out meaningless though most people don't care about these things br br there is however one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters noir cage which itself enters a vehicle lift another cage and is taken up into the chief gangster's lair like lynch's blue velvet otto retopologizes the film constantly likens upstairs to hell this works well but the set design fails to reinforce it br br 7 10 otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go like detour night in the city scarlet street in a lonely place act of violence bomberang and johnny eager where the sidewalk ends is one of those well made second tier film noirs it's competent and engaging but lacks that extra special magic
<START> the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep engaging powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well acclaimed play the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation which comes as a double edged sword on one hand who better to translate the play than the original writer on the other hand who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense with a frustrating ending unnecessary dialogue questionable directing and of course the inability to provide substantial answers it is a growing trend among these high caliber films to not answer all questions it provides and this has to stop br br doubt is like a joke without its punch line like a book with the final 20 pages missing like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next doubt just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men doesn't really end it doesn't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending yes that was the intent but this isn't a test of humanity it's a cop out i do not pay money to see an unfinished work i pay money to see a beginning middle and end and pray that i don't fall asleep during the three acts we are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other br br this little drama is about a nun meryl streep who seems very sure that the well beloved priest philip seymour hoffman is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church the first african american boy in the catholic church the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone's backs the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently which attracts the notice of a young teacher amy adams the story is set right after the assassination of john f kennedy which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other br br doubt's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over streep seems to be oscar worthy in every role she's in and here she is no different as her sternness and cold hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church hoffman excels yet again as the priest by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers when these two argue you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched but let's not forget amy adams enchanted and viola davis law ad order for their superb job either doubt's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008 br br yet like previously stated it's the writing and directing that ruins this film especially when dwindling down the third act questions pop up but they aren't answered characters pop up but provide no real enhancement towards the plot kids behave different but we never truly find out why there are awkward angles in the camera workÂandÂthere's no actual reason why john patrick shanley the writer of the play had one previous film in his directing repertoire joe versus the volcano whether sheer arrogance or stupidity we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation utter annoying chatter that bores to no end there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted thanks to mr shanley br br bottom line the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that's just as irritating as the seizureific camera work in action films it doesn't matter that we have a great talented acting cast or decent cinematography or a good story being worked upon or good usage of sound and music because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn't even finish the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate because we have the original madmen behind the projectÂbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end sideways cast away no country for old men burn after reading are a few examples br br newsflash end your stinkin' movie please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank like wall e's depressing backstories instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness confusion and mental anguish have a beginning middle and the end please as a critic i prefer my films to be whole not incomplete doubt feels incomplete which is why it gets an incompetent grade br br someone has to break this stupid trend
<START> the 1983 bbc production of jane eyre starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton love him has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day but watching this one almost equals to reading the book i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little and they inspired me to read the book at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book recently i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed it was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book such as my favorite gypsy scene after that i fell in love with this jane eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story the other versions don't if you haven't read the book br br the cast of 1983 jane eyre is excellent it's true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor handsome enough to play butler in scarlet and julius caesar but he is so great as rochester that i can't imagine anybody else playing this role and zelah clarke is without a doubt the only jane that follows the description of the book the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors jane looks so modest and naive just as bronte describes her although she doesn't look 18 but do you actually pay attention to that br br some people say that this jane eyre is too long but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not passionate enough or because there are not enough kissing scenes i hate when they make jane eyre some hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes you don't have to include crazy madly in love scenes to show the love between jane and rochester and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed i am 19 years old and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and old fashioned but i can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the purity and beauty of it after all the novel is set in 19th century and that old fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book br br i don't think there will ever be any other version of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one no matter who plays jane and rochester in other movies the real jane and rochester for me at least will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton
<START> this is an in name only sequel to a christmas story originally entitled a summer story ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick town in the middle of nowhere hilarity unfortunately does not ensue br br the original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty everyone could relate to it this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all charles grodin's last movie no wonder it's one of his poorest roles i felt sorry for him br br mary steenburgen is given little to do everything's formulaic and you have to wonder why they even bothered br br and i mean come on a competition with spinning tops sadly it's the best part of the movie
<START> i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad zombie bloodbath is a low budget video sure the acting is bad the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots the thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun the effects range from like someone on here has said pasty faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area the effects are very good for such a small film someone called it a party movie and it is 100 fun party movie i have heard from various websites that this is actually a rough cut of the film that got general release but the actual director's cut is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality i will buy it and judge for myself br br story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies the gov't closes it down hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area a few actors do a great job there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true good music great lighting some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up if you know what i mean then his guts are shoved out of his mouth another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect there are a million gore gags and it's almost all action i say stop being a prude enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market two great undead epics br br ok update i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought br br much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual director's cut of the film and it is a much better movie i liked it before but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one and the commentary helps too hearing sheets talk about the film in detail he knows it's a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to all people involved also sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn fox and mtv over all a fun little film that is very rough around the edges but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride i have seen many dv films and some shot of video films and many are quite dull but this one really wasn't while newer dv films are technically superior they just aren't this much fun br br ps i heard they are now remaking this on a big budget
<START> this foolish implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard boiled police detective delivers some nearly audible lines confirming our greatest fears he is dead perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment that a no name hack tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver his moment is brief his promise is immense perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill advised film
<START> it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
<START> well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directions br br for fans of these crazed italian thrillers they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he's put through the camera work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well the less you know about the story the better to make it work br br the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesn't have that extra sexual or psychological or both element to put it over the top it's more a routine mystery the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws br br the recent dvd 2005 release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely
<START> ride with the devil has something rich and special if you can stand the slow development while tackling a dark gritty subject the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s the movie maintains a strangely satisfying unmanipulated atmosphere what i'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses br br as an enthusast of this particular area of cw history i'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film the diologue is expertly written even with subtle humor occasionally with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles independence for example a far cry from the oregon trail the minor events that occur to jake's band are similar to actual events that took place especially the attack when they're holed up in the house and the destruction of the store booth the battle scenes though rare are pretty well executed it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recently br br the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways example the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre where's your army who are we to fight who are we to fight the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues you are cowards all who are the cowards really little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality br br there are no major glaring areas in the history something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up but you will never notice that a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african american man at arms character in the film is the quasi slave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack who would suspect him though this black rebel is a fasinating character whatever pc african americans might think of him not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas by the murderer senator jim lane and before the 54th mass reg of fame was organized and black troops in such battles as baxter springs ks played a critical role br br no glaring historical errors good realistic action which is infrequent and not gratitous good directing this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were but it's the cleanest job of any
<START> this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him succumb in piece
<START> thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn't deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they're told to do and they do it well it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place br br 0 out of 4
<START> there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don't know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming you're a super crime fighting valentine br br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nigh invulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates' mother br br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentine's day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspect br br here's problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds don't turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds he's not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentine's day party just because it's february doesn't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip br br the slasher in valentine dresses in head to toe black with a cherub's mask here's problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple it's not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isn't even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when you're not scratching your head you're yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if you're alone on valentine's day find something anything else to do you'll be glad you did
<START> this movie is just great it's entertaining from beginning to the end you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics br br sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy gabe walker together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john lithgow one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain br br and the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action br br brilliant movie
