<START> i know the film snobs are snorting but if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b movie jungle try jake speed br br a little thin at times but its one liners and the location more then make up for this john hurt god love him seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver the nemesis of crawfords jake speed he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide crawford and dennis christopher jakes sidekick are a good team although you do wonder why they both put up with each other however together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that if you can get over yourself for a moment you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor br br i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy or bogging down the movie by trying too hard not every movie has to be the latest citizen kane and trust me wells was an original so lets remember that sometimes movies are for fun not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero's live in a celluloid dimension
<START> a group of people are invited to there high school reunion but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on now he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines br br dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise bringing it up a notch are a few good performances some rather creative death scenes plenty of excitement scares some humor and an original ending br br unrated for extreme violence graphic nudity sexual situations profanity and drug use
<START> as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies unlike others however i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals the pre censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two chetas not to be missed an adventure classic
<START> enterprise the latest high budget spin off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90 minute episode called 'broken bow' first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban who are the main enemy in the first season of the show from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and action visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time br br the opening credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves if one listens to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful overall diane warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson br br what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered enterprise is in my opinion one of the most well cast shows since the next generation choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean luc picard as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins he simply is both actor wise and character wise a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox it's also nice to see a non human playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named 'porthos' was a well received idea throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect i say almost because sadly travis mayweather's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time each person makes this show worth watching smiles and feel good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx 01 br br the ship itself the nx 01 is somewhat questionable in design the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships namely the akira class starship continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick berman and brannon braga offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details if you see the show with and open mind then you'll have no problems but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself according to them the nx 01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker it changed the ideas in his head that's a good enough explanation for me lets move on of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer come on guys grow up when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans couldn't do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all if you can't accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do br br the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise aka flagship of the american fleet like it so much they are striking sets and represent the show perfectly br br rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you
<START> i was dying to see this once i saw the ridiculous meatballs poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever what a brilliant idea for a satire the genre is rife unfortunately the finished product as i think all involved probably realize is a catalogue of missed opportunities not quite there performances and thankfully a few extremely hilarious inspired bits janeane garafolo who is very striking looks really bad here probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny david hyde pierce is just sad to watch trying to hard to be funny and looking like a castro nerd molly shannon is so funny just seeing her makes you laugh but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical paul rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell the other guys are also really funny the nerdier ones i think the problem is the director just doesn't move things along at the right pace he starts out very deadpan and that sets the monotone but when he lets things get really outrageous the drug sequence is the second funniest moment i've had all year in movies the first also coming in a lame movie andrea martin in all over the guy complaining about the movie in out it's just plain funny i wanted this movie to work so badly but it just didn't the clothes and styling for 1981 are 99 9 perfect and the very few songs used are also perfect this ends up as a medium bad mad tv episode complete with frustratingly overlong sketches
<START> it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all time br br the film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques rivette's fantastic cÃ©line and julie go boating which was made around the same time it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change br br it involves a supposedly liberated mÃ©nage Ã  trois between alexandre played by jean pierre leaud marie bernadette lafont and veronika francoise lebrun yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze br br the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jean pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les quatres cent coups 1959 by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should be br br there is no improvisation unlike in john cassavetes's similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from real life conversations the film is resonant with eustache's personal experiences for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real life person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around
<START> first things first i was never once scared of this underrated gem as a kid little mermaid on the other hand as my title says this was one of my fav childhood movies that i still love as a teenager it's a beautiful bittersweet movie about a misfit german shepherd called charlie fantasticaly voiced by burt reynolds who is killed by his boss partner in crime is name ha ha is carface charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind chalie gets sent back to earth 'cause he winded up his life clock where he gets into even more mischief with his best friend itchy and a little orphan girl anne marie i used to watch this all the time as a kid and i still sometimes watch it anyways it's a beautiful bittersweet film as i said before that might just leave a tear in your eye
<START> i saw this movie in 1959 when i was 11 years old at a drive in theater with my family br br way back then i thought it was very funny even though i was too young to understand 90 of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight i saw it again this morning on turner south as i watched it i was absolutely convulsed with laughter the mating game is a unique classic from a by gone age if you're too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film i feel very sorry for you there's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can even today deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to old timers like me br br having said that all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like the mating game br br movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people and as such these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand br br in other words Â if you don't understand the issues the film is addressing please don't embarrass yourself by offering comments which Â frankly Â make no sense
<START> i think it's a great movie it's fun maybe a little unrealistic but fun and dramatic i would like to see it again if they were showing it in tv just 1 question are we still talking about the same movie
<START> honestly before i watched this movie i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie and watched it by my own apparently they were right i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did i watch this movie br br of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie theater business but morgan and kevin i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison to be honest their roles are rather stupid br br well you might think if the players suck then i should pay more attention to the story it is indeed story is the core of a movie but guys trust me this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story imagine this a smart ass journalist justin timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss morgan freeman this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice ll cool j and an brilliant investigator kevin spacey at the end they beat the system with a happy ending story br br jeez i could not even carry on with this just recalling the movie is making me sick already my advise guys don't watch this please save your money and time for another movie
<START> john boorman's 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though it's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a mÃ©nage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesn't get it instead it's lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson's worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but it's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics br br there's a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the 'general' and his men painting them as 'anti social' drug dealers purely because cahill won't share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we're expected to find lovably cheeky that it's just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then it's too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voight's hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleeson's comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven
<START> i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture an interpretation in my opinion will mislead a lot of people in addition i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie so if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this film this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people as well this was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered the film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the time machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future
<START> daniel day lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer br br the film however is a very difficult one to review or even watch fortunately i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter i can't say it's the sort of film i'd want to view more than once br br nevertheless my attention was held by the story telling device a flashback framed by the present in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him who certainly gave him loving care br br daniel day lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist fiona shaw much to his mother's fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken there's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much br br brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day lewis begins to have success with his work she complements day lewis' performance as the warm hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him br br richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film both fricker and day lewis won oscars but hugh o'conor and ray mcanally are also excellent o'conor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy br br summing up elmer bernstein's music is an added plus factor well worthwhile but definitely not a film for everyone
<START> oh yes sakura killers is a goofy horrible ninja movie make no mistake but it's also an incredibly enjoyable one this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes i suppose he's supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type the tough ninja buster the box copy exclaims but his 'wisdom' is laughable move without thinking my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation not of supreme concentration br br but really his two aides sonny and dennis have such horrible dialogue that 'brooklyn' as we call the colonel tends to shine in comparison especially watch for dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' the sakura are involved with if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing and yes this is a major plot point folks br br a terribly fun movie sakura killers is a hard to find gem i won't spoil the 'trick' ending for you either except that it's a perfect set up for a sakura killers 2 too bad chuck connors died because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas
<START> randall memphis raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the game when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for british crime boss raymond calitri the job involves lifting 50 cars in 24 hours or calitri will enact his punishment so raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand but the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes it would seem a near impossible job to complete br br it's got quite a cast has gone in 60 seconds nicolas cage angelina jolie robert duvall will patton delroy lindo vinnie jones giovanni ribisi christopher ecclestone scott caan timothy olyphant all of whom deserve better enough acting horsepower there to propel a porsche 998 turbo trouble is is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park mucho characters not enough zest from the off we are in no doubt that this is a bruckheimer simpson production bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese scattergun editing and directed with sledgehammer subtly by dominic sena it's essentially a big budget remake of h b halicki's 1974 indie movie of the same name with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie potential that sadly is never realised there's one or two high impact moments daft for sure but enjoyable none the less but if you pardon the pun the film never gets out of first gear it's more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay scott rosenberg work br br car fans will get something from it the cars are ace on the eye as will fans of unintentional comedy movies check out ecclestone's carpenter grief moment but no it's really rather poor all told 4 10
<START> first off i really enjoyed zombi 2 by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldn't stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi 3 has nothing to do with zombi 2 is even more a joke br br we jump from voodoo to death 1 the harmful agent brining people back to life whatever this movie isn't worth the 1 00 it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be i think i will just skip them br br zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho
<START> overshadowed by braveheart released the same year the two costume dramas beg comparison i admit my bias against mel gibson yet i maintain a rational preference for rob roy both braveheart and rob roy compellingly depict scots history in bloody romantic fashion braveheart is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy it's also melodramatic anachronistic and maudlin note its cornball usage of slow motion filming its violence is both ugly and glorious it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset while braveheart surpasses rob roy in sheer levels of carnage not to mention its indulgent running time the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying its action is more understated yet more surprising and clever its sex is less showy yet more erotic rob roy also has a better realized romantic interest its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era and tim roth is a superlative villain also recommended the last of the mohicans and the patriot you may find the latter more akin to braveheart with its emphasis on blood lust with the former more similar to rob roy in tone all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence
<START> there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled baby buggy bunny that was exactly this plot baby faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bug's rabbit hole he dressed up as a baby to get into bugg's hole to retrieve the money the scene in little man where he's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon this was a hilarious 5 minute cartoon not so much an entire movie if you are really interested in this buy the bugs bunny dvd it's was much more original the first time 1954 plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot
<START> rouen prizes and the triumph of villa paranoia the favorite film of the general public actually more important than the jury prize was erik clausen's brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy villa paranoia which was also selected by the european youth jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all ages the following day director actor clausen traveled to the remote town of mamers pays de loire for a provincial festival of new european cinema where villa paranoia picked up three more prizes best film professional jury best film audience prize and best film of another youth jury composed of lycÃ©ens french high school students five prizes in a single weekend not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors in addition villa was awarded the grand prix the maverick spirit award at san jose california just a week ago by distinguished british actor sir ben kingsley ghandi making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week if lars van trier has put denmark on the offbeat oddball dogma cinematic map in recent years there is now a good chance that veteran maverick erik clausen 62 and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel which is to say a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike moreover the female lead of his film sonja richter has such a magical screen presence that with a little more exposure she stands a good chance of becoming the next international scandinavian diva for the record villa paranoia is a fiction film written directed and acted in by mr clausen and employing certain motifs from moliere's the imaginary invalid anna richter an ambitious young actress has lost a deeply coveted role in the moliere play and reduced to making an utterly stupid tv chicken commercial is on the verge of suicide however jorgen clausen who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot offers her a job with room and board taking care of his cantankerous senile wheel chair ridden father walentin who has not spoken a word since his wife stella committed suicide years before anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch and moreover discovers that he has been faking deafness and immobility all these years a living malade imaginaire this will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to walentin's total withdrawal from life and reality villa paradise paranoia true to the moliere tradition from which it is partially derived is a heartwarming multi layered serial comic psycho drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves alex deleon paris 21 march 2005
<START> i read the book and the book was fascinating br br this movie it's direction the screenplay and the acting were totally insufferable i cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel a novel that has all the action simplicity and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story br br i can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know br br simply one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth br br the cinematography was indeed the only highlight but how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as peru br br to prospective viewers do not waste your time or energy on this flop
