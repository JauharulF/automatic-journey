<START> i've only ever seen this film once before about ten years ago i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to be br br paperhouse is much more than just a horror it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here it's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died she knew he was going to be alright br br several scenes did make me jump which is a rarity for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the bathtub the scene where anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust br br all in all an excellent and very moving film
<START> the gang of roses every rose has its thorns br br a mix of old western and hip hop blended perfectly together the clothing styles the scenery and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted br br plot in five years they robbed twenty seven banks and then vanished without a trace now a small western town is under siege and one of the first victims is rachel's sister the rose gang is ready to ride again and this time it's personal br br rachel michael calhoun chastity lil' kim maria lisaraye zang li marie matiko and kim stacey dash five gunslinging women who split up after five years of riding together when rachel's sister is killed she ends up rounding up her friends once again and riding on a trail of vengeance br br a good muck around version of western if you've seen bad girls well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters br br i gave it 10 10 because the characters plot and scenery made it for me
<START> several features of this film immediately date it the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques br br bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me br br somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie goers as in so many of her character roles bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress br br towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending
<START> i really don't get all the adulation that this film has received it's mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues ie nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but what's with all the praise for russell crowe's performance the man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowe's performance is little short of caricature it is also rather offensive and dare i say just on the right side of being truly terrible
<START> 1 10 and that's only because i don't go lower with my ratings br br skip this movie and wait for the last movie of the trilogy don't buy or rent it trust me you won't be missing a thing the architect brings no new info spoiler there have been more neo's before him he's like nr 6 or something you could already figure something like that out from the first movie agent smith telling us the first matrix created didn't work because it was too perfect trinity died and neo's love brought her back where have i seen this before oh right in the first movie the roles where reversed same as the action scenes nothing new just with more opponents the action scene the 20 ships in the big battle which we didn't see maybe in revolutions betrayed by someone hmmmm maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab neo who pushed the egm button to soon br br all in all a shameless ploy to make money especially off the guys who went to see it more then once which evidently worked like a charm
<START> this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong a simple robbery pick up some serious change get our finances together and everything will be hunky dory butÂmom and pop's jewelry store no problem insurance pays for it all no guns nobody gets hurt easy money br br older more successful it would appear brother andy philip seymour hoffman has a few minor problems heroin addiction cocaine habituation a wife marisa tomei thatÂwell he can't seem to perform for his flat belly days long gone younger sweet slightly dim witted younger brother hank ethan hawke with a few dinero problems of his own behind in child support payments for his daughter in debt to friends and relatives not exactly wowing them in the work of work etc br br sydney lumet in this performance at the age of 82 directs and gets it 99 99 percent right which is hard to do in a thriller i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes the improbabilities the cheesy scenes and the hurry up ending here lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art every detail is perfect the acting is superb the plot has no holes the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself br br hoffman of course is excellent when you don't have marquee leading man presence you have to get by on talent workmanship and pure concentration ethan hawke who is no stranger to the sweet little guy role adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age and marisa tomei who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy's two timing wife but who could blame her it's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars but if you study this film as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do you will notice the kind of excessive according to most hollywood producers attention to detail that makes for real art the sort of thing that only great artists can do and indeed cannot help but do by the way i think there were twenty producers on this filmÂwell maybe a dozen check the credits all i can say in summation is way to go sydney lumet author of a slew of excellent films and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced ageÂkudos may we all do half so well br br okay the 00 01 percent it was unlikely that the father albert finney could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail this is minor and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end we can guess and guess perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out and he just said leave it like that it really doesn't matter and i think it doesn't what happens to hank is not going to be good he isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life he is the kind of guy who gets a light sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been br br see this for sidney lumet one of hollywood's best director of the pawnbroker 1964 the group 1966 serpico 1973 dog day afternoon 1975 network 1976 and many more
<START> philo vance william powell helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show br br usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries like this but i love this movie it moves very quickly only 72 minutes is beautifully directed by michael curtiz he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along has a very ingenious story line including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible and has a very good cast br br powell is very suave and great as vance he doesn't seem to be acting he is vance mary astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production everybody else is very good too but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath he's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious br br basically an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery well worth seeing br br
<START> there are just so many things wrong with this movie br br to begin with the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten the overall movie is mercifully short already but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the mean lion how did the miss a reference to the wiz on that one and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot in short the script had the seed of a good idea but needed quite a bit of reworking br br second it could have done without the crude humor the original also had some that it could have done without but at least there it was almost an afterthought here flatulence and urination abound br br third the show is a little too self aware the original series had that well enough as did the first movie but here it's just way way too much the brendan fraser in jokes were just a bit over the top and why no mention of the new ursula other gags with the narrator especially a couple of interactions near the end also exceed good sense br br fourth a bit more attention could have been given to the cgi work in the first it was hard to tell that shemp wasn't a real elephant except by behavior of course but here the cgi stands out like a sore thumb ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad and they at least do succeed on that count so it's a relatively small problem but it's still there br br all that said christopher showerman's performance as george is decent enough it lacks brendan fraser's charm but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison he even managed to give george a bit of personal depth which should have been a major foul in a jay ward inspired movie but wasn't here julie benz as the new ursula surprised me as being even better than leslie mann in the original br br most other performances were pretty standard not standing out in my mind as either good or bad
<START> i got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it it had a 7 8 in imdb 9 votes only and some external comments were pleasant but i have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo yes great cinematography the film is well directed but it never freaked me out it starts well but although it not bored me at all the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal that i didn't like it very much br br you can make a few laughs and you can see some little tits but if you like the kind of giallos i like bizarre surreal nonsenseful gory atmospheric brutal murders you won't appreciate much this film br br i give it a 4 for the good directing and editing and the final twists that make the film entertaining but it could be much better
<START> this series premiered on the cable tv station comedy central in the united states it was chopped to death and shown out of sequence this was sad for the audience it should have attracted it didn't and fell by the wayside luckily at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc thank goodness because i got to see the league of gentlemen in order complete and uncut br br the league of gentlemen troupe is right up there with england's monty python's flying circus and canada's the kids in the hall but a warning br br the league of gentlemen though are one step beyond it's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills it goes deeper and much much darker i can tell many of you now it will offend certain groups of people it will enrage others but remember its only comedy dark dark comedy if that is not your thing don't watch if you think you know dark comedy watch this if you get angry and upset then you don't quite know dark comedy br br these guys got it right and right on the button they are brilliant they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation there's a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end you cannot watch this one episode at a time willy nilly that is one of the charms of this series watch it in order see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are no one and nothing is out of bounds that my dears is dark humor bravo
<START> the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours together i wont leave you behind br br the first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons in one scene they all have fake hk mp5 sub machine guns next scene ak 47 replicas and then to top it all off they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m 16s i think they had a budget shortage for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell you have to remove the pin spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own you can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re appear when a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid unless you have no idea how to reload them big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk
<START> i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed it's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise i'd say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming br br although it contains virtually every clichÃ© in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the 6th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling br br i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare
<START> as did others in this forum when fobidden planet was offered in 1956 i rushed to see it this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young old male female sci fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as flash gordon leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role at that time but walter pigeon marvin miller anne francis richard anderson earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well there are so many visual splendors in this one it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes the approach to altair 4 the starship itself the landing on the planet's alien surface the descent via extensor stairs the first view of the landscape the approach of the rocket sled dr morbius's house seen from without and from within the underground complex and its wonders the setup of the weaponry the battle with the monster the final approach of the unseen destroyer the escape from the doomed planet all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination it is a shock to realize there's no music at all the film is carried by the words the actors and the mystery revelation storyline it can be watched again and again with pleasure i have been doing so for nearly fifty years until this famous and well loved film was created no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward ships kept crashing back on the planet as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes still the best many say that says something negative about this nation's so called intellectual leaders' imaginations and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem
<START> br br this movie is by far one of my favorites i saw it while in college in the early 90's and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top notch to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon type movies and leave the movies with a great wholesome story to those who can appreciate them
<START> spoilers br br i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt br br the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things br br first of all the film was so down to earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis it became itself ordinary and dull br br secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable br br too bad

<START> i was mad anyone made this movie i was even more angry i lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this i could have had a wax job and been more entertained at least cherri makes me laugh before it hurts i was a bit confused at first but then i caught on and realized what was going on by this time the film was half way through and yes i am a procrastinator but i always want to see things through until the end so i stuck it out i watched it all not only are the actors not as attractive as in cruel intentions they just aren't convincing i've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie if you like bad movies with bad acting watch this
<START> i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won't get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent
<START> i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film jeepers creepers anyone br br a tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time it's not even comically bad br br what we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichÃ©d acting it just reeks of low budget br br avoid like the bubonic plague
<START> off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno rats night of terror mattei this is no dawn of the dead folks br br that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen br br the script is wonderfully horrible just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote let's try putting these two molecules together br br the zombies come in all varieties from moaning shufflers to machete wielding maniacs to birds br br the gore is plentiful legs are bitten off arms amputated stomachs burst open br br the pace is fast flying from one zombie attack to the next br br then there's the head in the fridge oh the head in the fridge one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2 br br you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night br br did i mention the head in the fridge
