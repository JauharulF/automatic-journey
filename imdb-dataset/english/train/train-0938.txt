<START> towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic the acting was pretty good since they're mostly seasoned professionals but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with well known faces i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature that's why i said it should have been more comical my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if they're in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist also i know it's a disaster movie but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening i like lee grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked
<START> one of the many merrie melodies cartoons that entertained american moviegoers during wwii bob clampett's an itch in time portrays a hobo flea settling on elmer fudd's dog the little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dog's back but elmer warns the dog one more scwatch and i'll give you a bath meanwhile the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog and that's not the end i noticed that in one scene elmer is reading a comic book featuring bugs bunny and porky pig obviously elmer and bugs frequently co starred but elmer never co starred with porky unless you count the very short any bonds today but to me the thought of elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they don't appear in this cartoon br br of course i'm probably going too far in my analysis i'm sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment and it certainly entertains as for the i might get to like this line it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldn't have allowed but somehow missed i for one don't actually know what it was supposed to sound like was it something sexual as for the end had i thought that i'd seen everything i would have been tempted to look for more rather than do what the cat did although it was a neat trick br br the guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for tnt didn't they
<START> i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv before the days of cable and satellite matinÃ©e i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough
<START> guinea pig the devil's experiment is without a doubt stars on first view its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature this movie gets right to the point you may be thinking what point the point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore this movie has some gore more or less just torturing a women violently there are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore i'll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen guinea pig the devil's experiment br br movie rating 0 5 gore 0 10 br br guinea pig the devil's experiment uncut 7
<START> the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff i've only seen perhaps eight of them but comet over broadway is the worst so far the very best thing about it is that it's short oh and the orry kelly gowns of course are fine james wong howe's cinematography is not kay francis throughout looks fat faced and far less attractive than she normally does minna gombell whom i don't know otherwise is good as a semi tough burlesque dancer it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque the closing shot kay francis and her child when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother did i doze off walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous the whole film is so cheap so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know in warner bros' cynical estimation of them that what they're getting is garbage
<START> i really loved this film yes i know it was fairly far fetched there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy he was a little too much don't you think anyway great film great cars and great acting i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night
<START> it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi 1982 Âhe was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago comparatively it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father pitting a shriveled anti hero against an international hero both of whom were historically real individuals and ironically father and son the events in the film are mostly real mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film setting high moral standards for the world to follow yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family br br the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals for gandhi his mission was larger than his family's aspirations he loved his family and cared for them though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached the film looks at an unusual case of parentingÂwhere an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less than brilliant offspring br br the film presents an unusual scenario that happened a son marries his childhood sweetheart upsetting his father the father upsets his son's educational aspirations at several key junctures the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion buffeting between islam and hinduism through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains until she chides him for being drunk br br feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium peter brook is a great director of plays but less competent as a film director the opening shots of khan's film promises great cinemaÂa derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital bombay mumbai barely mumbling that his father is bapu the popular name of mahatma gandhi father to an entire nation the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi's eldest son dying in poverty and loneliness apart from the dramatic opening the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust free and freshly laundered modern hairstyles of actors and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi's wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows the bane of indian cinema since feroz khan is a theater personality he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater royal academy of dramatic arts br br knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble even when there was no direct criticism in the film producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally br br with all its mix of greatness and faults gandhi my father throws several questions at the viewer is a mother son bonding stronger than a father son bonding in parenting is one's immediate family less important than humanity at large does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered in this film harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another while his father quotes scriptures forgive them for they know not what they do when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well br br the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty shah and an indian award from critics feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above average performances from the ensemble of actors i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad's tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards
<START> half the reviews were good so i took a chance for 10 sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in the early 1970s
<START> ah yes the vs series mvc2 being the pinnacle it's been said before this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job unfortunately the gameplay half did don't get me wrong this is fun but you get tired of mashing buttons as for the plot summary ahahahahahaaaaa there is no plot beat that guy at the end and win eh who plays this by their self anyway
<START> one of those why was this made movies the romance is very hard to swallow it is one of those romances that suddenly click they are in love the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments the drive in restaurant being the most notable charles grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie it's just him and louise lasser ask yourself do you want to watch grodin with his neurosis and lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half
<START> saw this today with my 8 year old i thought it was cute i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember but we still enjoyed it all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms good message about standing up to bullies and of course a sappy happy ending
<START> i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites' as blood rites was entirely awful i really wasn't expecting much from this film but actually it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course there is an inheritance at stake the film is shot in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp' there's barely any gore on display and the director seems keener to focus on sex with themes of incest and hatred seeping through the acting is typically trashy but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful the plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves as most are somewhat erotic overall this is not a great film but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites'
<START> overall i was rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle br br bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films television shows which deal with the subjects i referenced i think you will find at least something here br br in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way i especially liked how they explained where the cylon's belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers br br the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays 'lacy rand' while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something i think needs work i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident br br based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where 'caprica' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did
<START> cinderella is one of the most beloved of all disney classics and it really deserves its status based on the classic fairy tale as told by charles perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of cinderella a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters when a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited read the king wants to get the prince to marry cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her but there is a fairy godmother on hand br br the story of cinderella on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become cinderella's true sidekicks the mice jaq and gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat lucifer their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy tale plot and are for the most part wonderful admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly since cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably ends up as one of the most involving disney stories br br the animation and art direction is lovely all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture and mary blair's colour styling and concept art she also did concept art and colour styling for alice in wonderland peter pan the three caballeros and many many others manage to wiggle their way on screen the colours and designs are lovely especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and there br br overall cinderella ranks as one of the best disney fairy tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true
<START> too many secondary plot lines without a primary one too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason they managed to stuff this boring film that does not say anything with every drama element that is out there death divorce money issues parenting problems suicide psychological problems drug abuse adoption rejected love traveling problems sex generations misunderstandings robbery legal issues guns medical ethics deep real love Â you would think that it would make for an interesting movie but hell no Â all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there boring not to mention that the super deep and super long lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense pity br br oh forgot to mention the actors all of them are quite good that's what kept me from turning it off to bad their talents went to waste the film is well shot too the light the motion etc of every episode that's all in place it's just the meaning that's missing
<START> i disliked frosty returns and this one both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices the voices could have been done but frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming drama the only good thing about this film was frosty the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then frosty walks by the window humming whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and i barely got the plot i saw the dvd cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so i didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but i played this film it was a hassle poorly art characters just like the dvd and it was just terrible about what's going on i watched this at night and found it dull that i fell asleep on the whole thing wait i always do that when i watch something while i go to sleep but this movie was overall boring br br overall rating grade c br br this is like another holiday special bad rip off in the frosty returns and this one this one is the badly 4th sequel like home alone 4 well i thought that movie was ok but home alone 3 was great but it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this my sister didn't watch it that much because when she came into my room to watch 2 minutes and a half of it she walked away like i hate the animation i agree to her just like the 3rd one frosty returns plain awful
<START> i loved this movie the characters were people that you could feel for the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together the most touching scene however was the young couple at his great grandfather's house i laughed in parts cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in fact i've re watched it about 5 times a definite must see for total romantics
<START> even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in 1981 kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles as holmes's wife and underage girlfriend respectively the rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them the film also stars carrie fisher ted levine franky g mc gainey dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton
<START> this will be a different kind of review i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in sundance's reaction made an impression on me too as did the director victor nunez who has directed and written several movies about florida this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings well i told you it would be a different kind of review
<START> this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 so i was definitely going to watch the repeat i really sympathised with the main character of the film because this is true i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb this is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder jonny kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through puberty but he is 36 years old most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition and pealing off his bandages jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin he tells his story with the help of his mother edna kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and jonny's supporter nell mcandrew it won the baftas for best editing and best new director factual and it was nominated for best sound factual and the flaherty documentary award it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 a must see documentary
