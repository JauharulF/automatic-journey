<START> this was a better than average movie i thought for it being on cable i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughter target shot etc br br the cast was well chosen i especially liked ron livingston as the hard pressed swat commander it's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers the producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997 br br so if you get a chance to see this film and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything 50 times take 2 hours and enjoy it
<START> there is no story the plot is hopeless a filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator no brakes and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good i would have stopped that car within one minute whether i was in it or in the police car constantly following it i feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script the few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over dramatized and as far from reality you can get in addition there were a lot of blunders for instance the hood of the runaway car which was popped doing 100mph at first it just folded over the windshield like it would in reality but then afterwards it blew off the car was later in the movie observed with the hood on br br this film was nothing but annoying stay away from it
<START> at the end of the film i just asked myself is it the worse movie i have ever seen or is it the worse movie i have ever seen and the answer is actually after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it you just can't find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes which are unbelievably brutal and useless it seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowd's head what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and it's horrors during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president bush's speeches about the necessity of starting a war with iraq and in the second scene the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman's vagina are directly followed by archive pictures of world war ii but as a matter of facts i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror's expression being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt sorry for bad english
<START> this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say enough already of course it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes eric phillips don wilson is an undercover cop in the near future when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look a like cyborg it is up to eric to clear her name wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me being a pm production there are tons of car chases exploding cars 4 in the first 5 minutes and shoot outs i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995
<START> this movie was horrible br br they didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly it was a definite sleeper you'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d wars surprises you with even a let down in that department br br also the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick and i seriously mean that br br i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad please whatever you do people don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d wars
<START> sergeant ryker is accused of being a traitor during the korean war a hanging offense a long drawn out court marshal ensues during which time the sgt must remain in a military jail after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non com with an eleventh hour ploy very good picture
<START> the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohen's intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one br br to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream i'm a singer is a true pain it's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon's imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments it's cohen's art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale br br in this cohen's tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show it's cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter's he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didn't stay in the family br br fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home br br a sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do
<START> pere is an idiot but he is aware about it and acts in consequence his life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it when his last friend nicco dies he feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk when he is returning home he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements although she ignores him he fells in love and starts to follow her obsessively well the beginning of the film is a bit slow and can result boring for most people however as action begins it is a little better not much maybe the best part is the 5 minutes of sex almost 30 different scenes about it that you can see in the middle of the movie it is not good for the erothism but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene probably it is the best of the film neither the actors nor the directing is good and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people not for me all the film is based on absurd situations idiot as the film says that have anything interesting i like ventura pons but i have to admit that this is not one of his best films maybe his worst he knows to do it better
<START> is it just me or is that kid really annoying br br hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know he's a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far i'm only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i can't not know what it's all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards i e dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie i'll update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement
<START> contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exact br br everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it won't stick alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate br br that's ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrol br br the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasn't worked after all standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didn't work he's never really intimidated by people remember br br but sidney we want to stop it too br br barely a moments hesitation before he's off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must've caused no br br also notable is dapne's role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks she's finally found love outside of her father's company at first she doesn't really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention she's finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that it's not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesn't fit it's more admiration and perhaps even inspiration br br upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a refreshment br br thank you sidney if you would've said 'yes' i think i'd have strangled you br br i love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we don't really know but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a cont'd relationship would've been nice but as billy joel says it's more than i'd hoped for br br
<START> i don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england but without the sentimentality of blackboard jungle the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate the estate looked like an old prison stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective reassigned to the juvenile division urgent urgent larceny five iced lollies he finds he is the butt of many jokes david mccallum showed that he was one of britain's top young talents of the fifties he had a very different role in another stanley baker film hell drivers his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie i wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it br br detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the firefly just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough he is assigned to the juvenile division he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work amid all the heckling he gets his first call out the 6 year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops br br taking the twins home he meets their brother the charismatic johnny and their embittered sister cathie he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals as he gets more involved with the family he realises there is a strong link between the fires johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry the local priest peter cushing in an unusual role away from the hammer horrors explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear the teacher thinking only of her own safety runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman br br i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war br br highly recommended
<START> is this the worse star trek tos episode maybe at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5 i mean this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense seeing something that makes you go mad give me a break this episode also has a different feel to it the music is heightened almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress to the point that it sucks give me some klingons gorns tholians romulans higher beings like triskelion's or anything but medusin's these are very boring aliens to make an episode around mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase he's dead jim spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but kirk does not they go through that freaking barrier now for the third time that i can remember boring at least season three's next episodes would be spectre of the gun and day of the dove and others to follow making trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans personal observations trek loved to use the color purple its kind of a pinkish purple like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment the gangway that is normally grey is now purple we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see i noticed it in several episodes it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode in the ships corridor is pretty lame
<START> this film centers on four criminals locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell hoping that a mysterious book of black magic penned by a former inmate around 1920 named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young br br carrÃ¨re's gÃ©rald laroche criminal business tactics shortcuts have landed him in prison with three oddball cell mates a transsexual brute marcus clovis cornillac marcus' love toy pÃ¢querette dimitri rataud who eats objects he touches and is in prison for eating his six month old sister and obeys his charge as if he were his mother and the scholarly lassalle philippe laudenbach who doesn't read or eat breakfast the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day the film follows carrÃ¨re as he reads from the book attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison carrÃ¨re loves his child and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail when she betrays him carrÃ¨re begins to slowly seethe with hate and longing to see and hold his beloved son carrÃ¨re's toughest critic is marcus who longs to be fully female while still folding to several masculine traits such as working out and taking a leak standing up he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic although deep inside is a world of vulnerability pÃ¢querette is completely under marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master there's even an alarming scene where pÃ¢querette breast feeds from marcus lassalle is an unraveling mystery opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain clearly intellectual and holding possible secrets from the others lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going soon those who aren't a threat to the book seek their true escape not as much from the cell of four walls but the cell that imprisons their true desires after a certain murder the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away and better yet how to use it a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach br br i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film it does play out like monkey's paw the characters get what they desire but a price must be met there's gore in the film startling moments of graphic violence but in my opinion this is first and foremost a story driven tale the gore is a product of what the book unleashes one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire we see danver's fate at the end with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence i will say that malÃ©fique through eric valette's well paced direction always kept my attention and for being such an isolated movie about 95 of the film takes place in a singular location the prison cell it never seems to drag i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them
<START> i still haven't gotten to see all of this it's running on cable right now and i seem to keep coming in on the middle of it my main reason for being interested in it is that i'm a bill paxton fan he's a pretty good actor and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career br br the other thing is that while never really a fan of the old series i kinda liked thunderbirds for the ships and effect work derek meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies and his designs for the international rescue craft are wonderful the current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen br br but br br this is one lame story the kids are asked to drive it and while they do an okay job it's hard to suspend your disbelief especially when you have brains' eight year old son flying t2 an enormous multi ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a buick everywhere you look you see a ford logo product placement is way over the top here and it's annoying ben kingsley does an good job as the hood but he can only do so much with a one dimensional role if you can accept the film on its very slim merits thunderbirds is a fun enjoyable ride just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it br br addendum i finally got to see all of this and it's worse than i thought the acting is fairly uniformly poor and while the effects are fairly good the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier the overdone product placement for ford is annoying and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves as with the avengers if you ignore the source material it's bearable but not very watch the original show and you'll see what i mean br br and a word of advice to jon frakes take a refresher course at the director's guild you can do better than this old friend br br another footnote br br i saw this again last night on telemundo dubbed in spanish with cheesy comedy sound effects and yes i came in roughly in the middle with ben ron and sophia in their fight scene on tracy island br br i didn't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse but it was it was embarrassingly bad br br if this had been done straight no kids to the rescue no tongue in cheek jokes it might have worked as it is it's just another beloved childhood joy that's been ruined
<START> amazing acting music a simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through i don't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was so many of the characters were so real it moved me and made me think i would like to watch more like this br br the idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom br br the film tackles issues of religion prejudice drugs friendship memories difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself
<START> the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor a visual treat to the eye the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart i was intrigued at first by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to find their capacity for love what follows is a huge disappointment boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance at times her face is frightening to look at a unfeeling mask as a monk boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse when he leaves his marriage to god the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past however the journey that follows is all too predictable
<START> this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually get offbeat films i thought i'd give it a try unfortunately they were largely right in this instance br br the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting the sort of feel that is impossible to describe but it's not a good one to further confound things the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting br br the immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurman br br one thing the esteemed film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed ahem front bottoms br br because of the chortles acheived throughout while i wouldn't recommend this film there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different
<START> the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods soft for digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination however there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film an old man living by himself in a house during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me i found the tempo of the film a little too slow the limited dialogue was not a problem however the development of the story and its conclusions after watching the film took too long i feel more could have been made of the relationship ghostly encounters with the child and the old man alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations children are always scary as ghosts see dark water
<START> this film concerns a very young girl cassie melissa sagemiller who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman one night cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him as cassie was driving a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love this is a way out film and not very good at all
<START> i read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later i saw the movie there are a few differences br br 1 billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days not 10 worms in one day by 7 00pm br br 2 billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms in the movie after billy eats all the worms joe has to go to school with worms in his pants br br 3 joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie he doesn't at all br br even though there are changes this movie is still one that kids will enjoy
