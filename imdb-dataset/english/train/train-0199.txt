<START> post feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism br br spoiler alert br br this underrated gem of a film tells the story of flavia a fifteenth century girl of noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of medieval christian society by viewing a fallen islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure br br unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and through butting up against a whole system of subjugation repression and violence inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her br br billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth this is a film depiction the consequences of violence the effects of patriarchal dominance the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit br br i described it in the title of this piece as 'post feminist' and in the end flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted compromised and perverted by men even flavia's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror br br as to the much discussed violence this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess to have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is exposing in addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society br br beautifully filmed brilliantly acted notably by florinda bolkin and maria casares containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years flavia is a classic of european cinema
<START> man's castle is a wonderful example of a pre code film it involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters spencer tracy plays bill a free soul without a dime in his pocket he makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings one night he meets trina a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone she has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship his free spirit tempts him to leave her so life is rocky but there is a true spark between the two even if they live in a shack by the river br br tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen his characters are amazing and relatable we can see his thoughts on his face making him easy to identify with even if we believe he is behaving badly young is great in pre code films her character is very sweet but far from perfect making her all the more likable br br pre code elements include skinny dipping pregnancy before marriage and crime
<START> a vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'baby jane' reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to 'compulsion' who run away to hide in hollywood they run a school for would be movie tots a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms debbie in her blonde wig 'i'm a harlow you're more a marion davies' she tells winters leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad weaver she also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she'd done before the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie it looks wonderful with great period detail 30's lots of lovely swipes at hollywood and the terrifying movie tot micheal macliammoir has a ball as the drama coach 'hamilton starr' he purrs 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless' see it and love it
<START> i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example br br having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh o'brien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads don't know if that was true br br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
<START> i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title until one day i was scrolling through john candy's film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named once upon a crime something rang a bell and i clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories br br i've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy it is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills br br the movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an american couple who find a woman's dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward only to find her dead body upon arrival from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers br br kind of a mix between it's a mad mad mad mad world and a lighter hitchcock feature this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends such as john candy to star in it the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isn't totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
<START> though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors special effects that are excellent and a story line that is full of surprises it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd perhaps it contains too much 'anti police force' information or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it br br the theme is old rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt in this case the f r a t first response assault and tactical team a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime drugs prostitution etc working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now 15 years after its formation frat is responsible for murder drug trafficking terrorizing innocent people etc the lead dog is lazerov dylan mcdermott who makes a terrifyingly real gangster and his partner rafe deed ll cool j even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor reporter pollack justin timberlake catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss ashford the always reliably fine morgan freeman gradually polack convinces ashford and subsequently wallace kevin spacey also a consistently fine character actor and they aid pollack in this investigative reporting the closer pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results br br timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead especially in the company of such seasoned actors but ll cool j freeman spacey and mcdermott keep the well oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end no it is not a great movie but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message grady harp
<START> i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him her the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen br br after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love br br one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality br br the skin show in this film is off the charts in addition to jane's two piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not o'sullivan but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips br br it's a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie
<START> this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies two harbors is a b w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out of the box when selecting this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two harbors is completely without merit but i'll get to that a little later br br as is common with independent films two harbors is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations Â a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middle aged main character vic played by alex cole writer director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information Â vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors all the chatting i've said it before and i'll say it again Â we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film Â particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long br br the other problem with two harbors is the acting i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on low budget projects Â even in minnesota many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is naÃ¯ve in narrative film making next to the story nothing is more important than the acting performances if you don't believe the people enacting your story your audience is lost br br originally i thought vculek was using non actors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theater type actors it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera it's that they were overly theatrical i e big granted the best of the actors were the two leads Â cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic's extra terrestrial hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only not coming from a real organic place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence Â a midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world br br i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here's what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful Â it's like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film Â subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all Â that it's based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re write two harbors might make a really kick ass stage play Â maybe even a one act if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or whomever there might be something to this story after allÂ br br for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at www reel13 org
<START> even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu sized egg based on the classic phil silvers tv series it bombed because a it was updated to the 1990s and b the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly screenplay br br the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble and it shows no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time
<START> this is the most depressing film i have ever seen i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the crops were vital yes i get all that what i find hard to take is i can't remember one single light moment in the entire film maybe it was true to life i don't know i'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and i know that every film can't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion br br i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film i can't stress enough how this film affected me as a child i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back i think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the prozac
<START> an interesting idea for a film both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together when he was younger einon got stabbed in the heart so bowen dennis quaid took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart now grown up einon david thewlis is now the selfish and evil king meanwhile bowen is using a new friend draco the dragon voiced by sir sean connery to get rewards for killing dragons but because einon has half of draco's hear they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt or killed also starring pete postlethwaite as gilbert of glockenspur jason isaacs as lord felton julie christie as queen aislinn and john gielgud as king arthur it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects worth watching
<START> to the small minority seen here praising this film get serious i know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push poor in every way don't con people by saying otherwise storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries script is likewise attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead wow don't disguise the film makers lack of ideas and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares absolutely no redeeming qualities utter utter turd i've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame
<START> br br although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story br br one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year old's they barely know but i doubt it br br one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world br br one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake but i think not br br one may believe that 30 something year old troublemakers can enter into and hang around inside a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this br br one final nit throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome but because it was never detailed each reference distracts from each scene br br this movie did not ring true for me
<START> no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the gong show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90 minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed up millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes or the network executive hounding him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a 30 minute sitcom episode but not as a full length movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil hartman's first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits which is the name he was born with you can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he's much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed molinaro hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world
<START> this film reinvents the term spring breakumentary hans the fat one of the group displays his talents as this generations chris farley johnny kansas the king of the 1 bet shows he's not in kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes kyle's laugh is truly infecting and offers a little eye candy for the ladies as well as does matt the dwarfs while having their moments did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves and last we have our protagonist ed he gives hope to all of us bumbling stumbling gangly pale folk who are still searching for that special someone and that hope is a little place called cabo san lucas while this blockbuster just missed the theaters this is a must rent as we can all relate to one of these spring breakumentarions
<START> this movie was so bad i don't know whether to laugh or cry i had high hopes for horrorfest that year which was also the first year i attended horrorfest and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level mad kudos to the advertisers because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen the other ones i saw were unrest dark ride and reincarnation the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film and to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a 'bite' out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if i had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film i would have left the theater halfway into the movie br br complete waste of money and time cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this absolute rubbish so bad that two years later i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen also while you're reading this steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen and all the crap about 'stuff they don't show you in theaters' they weren't referring to blood or guts or horror they were referring to the movies themselves because they're horrendous think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival but for horror movies br br sorry for all the 'hate' but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money
<START> after being forced to sit through some real stinkers racing stripes shark boy and lava girl i truly enjoyed watching fried worms for once i did not guess the ending it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross out humor despite the title my boys 6 and 10 both loved it too oh and my 45 year old boy had a smile on his face the whole time this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life he is not stopping singing just to annoy me also the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right on with the way kids behave of course the parents have to act a little goofy but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job have fun
<START> yet another remake of fistful of dollars sergio leone's remake of kurosawa's yojimbo suggested by the novel 'red harvest' br br this one is strictly a b movie taken as that it is rather enjoyable the direction is crisp the acting full of verve the limitations of its 'direct to video' photography well handled br br the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful' 'yojimbo' plot to a sub plot from leone's 'once upon a time in the west' although leone directed both 'fistful' and 'west' his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different the 'man with no name' eastwood is a borderline socio path with a soft spot for broken families harmonica chaeles bronson is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge these two characters would not have had much to do with each other in order to bring them together 'gun crazy' has to twist it's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we're actually following br br but this is a b movie after all and filled with action and silliness it's entertaining on that level just don't expect anything more
<START> comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle's show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn't funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that's common we don't need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should've never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show
<START> brand hauser john cusack is an assassin for the cia he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan a nation that the united states has liberated and kill a businessman named omar shariff this is because the american conglomerate tamerlane that is putting the country back together will not stand for shariff an oil man from a neighboring state laying down his own pipeline through war torn turquistan but once there brand runs into difficulties one he meets a determined journalist natalie marisa tomei who wants to tell the american public the true story of the region's conflict and of tamerlane but brand is aghast to realize that natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission also his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop singing princess yonica hillary duff who will be getting married at the convention center she is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn brand's attention away from the coming assassination with other inept underlings and complications will brand be able to carry out his mission for the satisfaction of tamerlane's big boss the former vice president dan ackroyd good for you john cusack to make this film even though it doesn't quite hold together shot in serbia it is a worthy look at what present day iraq must be like a country turned upside down in a stroke a brilliance the green zone here is called the emerald city and aptly so for this oz like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis the cast is very fine with cusack doing a nice job and tomei joan cusack ben kingsley ackroyd and others backing him up in style duff especially does a great turn as the heavily accented heavily made up potty mouthed singer the recreation of war riddled baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top notch as for the script it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes for example a young turaqui boy offers to show brand an enemy hideout in exchange for money and candy brand produces the cash but because he has no candy the boy burns his vehicle anyway brilliant then also the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often no if you have conservative leanings you probably won't like this film one bit but if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the war on terrorism this is quite a good show therefore do make an effort to view it as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio formulas
