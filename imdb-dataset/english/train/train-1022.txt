<START> i had watched the eye before i watched this one i really liked the eye it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror cinema so i picked this bangkok haunted because it was the same director and it was kind of popular round here but man what a disappointment bangkok haunted are three stories about love revenge ghosts etc that are no scary at all not even disturbing as the eye was no nothing i can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment br br 100 boring br br my rate 2 10
<START> i just rented yes i paid money to see this film omg it is one of the very worst films i have ever seen as another reviewer put it ms colagrande get out of films please please never make or appear in another film the lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe no that's not fair to the cantaloupe which probably has more going for it she does not know how to act she affects a disgusted look all the time reminded me very much of my always disgusted young sisters in law from europe she is not charming she is not pretty there is no real story and the editing there wasn't any that i could see it's pretty bad when you are watching a film and just to get through it you press forward forward on your remote and still nothing happens i mean i kept involuntarily screaming cut cut what were they thinking well obviously they thought they would make a film together and get paid to make love on screen pretty good deal for them pretty raw deal for the viewer i think i'm going to throw up now
<START> i just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd if you flip the to the other side of the dvd they show the actual movie so i gave it a chance seriously folks this is grilled cheese br br the acting special effects and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic doesn't she need lungs said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body and tom servo just wistfully remarks no she's got neck juice the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k porn i loved the cat fight between the two strippers that meow after the fight or scene whatever was classic so in some ways this was a fun movie i think for horror fans you'll probably enjoy it for a good time watch the mstk3 version you'll get a great laugh br br mst3k version 10 10 the brain that would die 1 10
<START> les acteurs is the absurd story of jean pierre marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water the story of a conspiracy against actors the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema br br supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting the fourth wall the hidden cameras to play or not to play the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera the film is not voyeur is quite vague and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing as andrÃ© dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part great actress she's hilariously serious especially when in dussolier's role she bitches about herself as actors run in each other on the street asking for autographs as fights and gossip happen we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each or others have played br br actually for whoever does not know the actors most of them being at least in their 50s or does not know french cinema this movie has less interest since most of the references will be missed but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging on acting on public life
<START> a definite no a resounding no this movie is an absolute dud br br having been recommended to me by a friend very much into that sort of thing i watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed changed moved altered uplifted and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when i suddenly see the truth now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical the metaphysical physical boundaries of existence believe me i am not such a person i try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly br br in terms of content the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative was the bit about peptides emotions addiction and cellular receptors that was the only unifying element i could find in the documentary part of this film the rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere try to tie up and conclude to a point and what was all that stuff about native americans not being able to see the ships that columbus came in who told the authorities in this film that that was what happened in 1492 where they there too had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition the famous gorilla video for example visit the visual cognition lab at the university of illinois site there may have been a more convincing point made here however it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo jumbo br br as a film this wasn't one film it was two i found the documentary part mildly interesting just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about i was annoyed that their credentials weren't presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke at least initially but i found the story part of the movie with matlin in it annoying disjointed intrusive non related and downright stupid that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny it was laughable ludicrous sophomoric and stupid and i found the use of the word pollack offensive it just seemed so out of place and wrong is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group that may be okay to make a point but it didn't seem to be used that way here and in any case i don't care what the reason it offended me a pole i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as pollack and i certainly don't like like it when others do can i watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used you betcha but again this didn't seem to be the case here it just seemed so out of place unprovocked unmitigated br br the acting was abysmal elaine hendrix's performance was totally unbelievable at times it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her marlee matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing perhaps she was baffled by the material i know i was if she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged up anxiety prone malcontent it just didn't seem to click but by far the world's worst was hendrix all in all i found this a disjointed poorly acted piece of clap trap
<START> i will be short this film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer the very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are treated to a lingering dance scene the plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of bad horror will get anything out of it and for the love of god please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not childish fumbling lesbians what the hell this was by far the worst film at the edinburgh festival that i saw anyway someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldn't take any more of it this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy in short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class a drugs
<START> an uninspired and undistinguished new columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his nephew's wedding only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night columbo investigates br br and that it is about it indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script given that it is written by robert van scoyk who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story murder under glass in the detective's heyday there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the script writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding which include everybody who was there br br devoid of every columbo trait possible i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues an insult to the history of the series with appropriately soap opera style acting very avoidable stuff
<START> before this the flawed slaughterhouse five was the best but this screen adaptation of mother night is very true to the book and keeps the comedy mystery and tragedy intent thankfully it wasn't hollywood ized or idiotized a la the movie of breakfast of champions another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it as i think you do for slaughterhouse five that's probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie nick nolte did an excellent job in this film
<START> i first saw this video 15 years ago i thought it was excellent then and i still do i am a former teacher of english high school and college and a lover of english romantic poetry so coleridge rates highly with me anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story wouldn't get my vote of excellence in this case everything works well to engage the viewer especially high school students the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television in addition the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it okay so there wasn't a big budget for the project so it wasn't star wars and there's no cgi in it but who can dismiss gustave dorÃ© illustrations as part of the presentation the comment above which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash is grossly unfair and unperceptive i'm a friend of the producer but that isn't my reason for this comment rather i'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels it is well suited to bring coleridge's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts
<START> i wouldn't say this totally sucked but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house steve martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he's just not funny he's another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
<START> final score 1 8 out of 10 br br after seeing 'jay and silent bob strike back' i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie 'soul survivors' is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up and comers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writer director stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of 'open your eyes' or 'vanilla sky' and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident death the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i don't think these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but 'ss' is rock bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus it's pg 13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene at least i would get something out of this then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off that's it people thought this was hot 'soul survivors' is one of those drop dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci fi channel due to it's low cost and pg 13 rating and that's probably best for it
<START> jake speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message it has its flaws of course at times it's a little slow it introduces its villain too far into the story it's action is paced at the rate of a snail's heartbeat it has a z grade cast although i've always admired the work of karen kopins who has the straight laced good looks of sandra bullock br br but with all this going against it jake speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford who plays the title role and andrew lane br br why do i find it so inspiring because it says to me hey why not try to be a good person br br the story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is good and heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people jake is more than a boy scout he's more than a knight in shining armor jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil world br br it's because of this that jake speed really needed to be a hit it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world br br imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people i'm not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex but that it would be nice if more movies such as jake speed would get a chance due south a tv show about a canadian mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainment br br sure jake speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person you'll beat the forces of evil every time 10 14 99
<START> this has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot it is another sailors on leave film zippier than astaire's 'follow the fleet' but not as good as 'on the town' br br kathryn grayson is bland but kelly and sinatra work well together their 'if you knew susie' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it 'i begged her' is also fun with sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like grady sutton rags ragland carlos ramirez and pamela britton and an unlikely but impertubable jose iturbi as himself to keep one watching br br kelly is the star of the film although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children which astaire never did dean stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the kelly character he also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl sharon mcmanus that is entrancing and sweet br br very pleasant then but a bit too long a taster of better musicals to come
<START> most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right it combines elements of humour suffering rebellion etc in a way that is comlex sympathetic the ending could be a bit clearer but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer
<START> i caught this movie on t v last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film and its great to see him in something other than that 70s show the film isnt rated but in my opinion i would rate it r just because of the nudity and plenty of adult content but all in all i loved it i thought that dirt's wisecracks were pretty funny its just basically about a guy who has no job girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator more of a messenger really he gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out i give it 3 stars
<START> not sure one can call this an anti war film it shows war at an elite level these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it even when they are pacifist they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes even if it does go against being a pacifist the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go more so by todays standards no body parts flying off as in modern movies it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level this is more of a thinking man's movie once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions is what the movie is about not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline this maybe called a war triller br br if you are into the skill of war if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on you want to watch this movie br br comparable movies are the hill 1965 with sean connery 49th parallel 1941 with an all star cast the naked and the dead 1958 with cliff robertson all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level enjoy
<START> as the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an rpg you seriously thought they were gay are you retarded if you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends they weren't gay lovers like your bitching about and to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period back then women did just prepare meals while the men fought do you even know your history do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day this game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story
<START> i felt asleep watching it and i had tickets for the midnight premiere any questions the most disturbing scene as far as i can remember was the techno dance i dont know what that was scene by the way what an ending
<START> when ever a film is produced or directed by mel ferrer you can bet your life any of his pictures will be seen for generation after generation just having claudette colbert ellen r ewing the egg i '47 appearing and starring in the film will make it even more of a great classic film in this film ellen ewing gets married and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murder the mystery gets very much involved and robert ryan david mclean battle of the bulge '65 comes to the aid of ellen and sometimes you even wonder about david being on the up and up as you view this picture you just about find yourself beginning to understand who is the real nutty person and all of a sudden you begin to change your mind how the film will end great acting by claudette colbert and robert ryan who played an entirely different role than he usually portrays on the screen i forgot to mention that mel ferrer was married to a great film star audrey hepburn great classic film with great classic actors
<START> when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words i'm not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of us people like morvern do no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point possibly the sum of the entire story is the point and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesn't substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing br br this is not the usual complaint of a book lover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half educated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite morvern's own self characterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working class scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldn't deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see this br br the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting she's rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus' son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesn't have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morvern's responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy serio comic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isn't at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isn't scottish the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent and she ought to be it's important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it's winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest what's left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead
