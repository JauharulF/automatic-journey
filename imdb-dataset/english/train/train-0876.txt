<START> i gotta say clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made i've played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
<START> oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they're simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you're drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don't think so
<START> kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita at first their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father daughter relationship one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice br br keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right the only problem is the annoying visual style which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it's been possessed by demons i wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it's spread through out the whole movie then that's when we have some problems the same annoying style was recently used on domino and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie br br another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images somehow williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience it rather makes you feel like you're being punished the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it i don't know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie br br the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart if the end of the movie doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily for him he gets to play a great character the whole idea of a man that's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge radha mitchell plays marc anthony's wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i can't hate the movie too much j lo's husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn't really stand out much mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact br br one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie a little too late for that if you ask me let's hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this
<START> boring long pretentious repetitive self involved Â this move felt like a bad date worse the tedious art school direction with a heavy handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up Â is constantly screaming to be noticed add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in it gets worse instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice overs and quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters really loud opera music too blame it all on the director br br the actors are all quite good the lead actor miguel angel hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom he and the other actors have some tender erotic moments even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a bel ami porn job the stunning college campus architecture as a location in mexico city is inspiring how come universities in the us are so bland sfsu uc etc but wait for the dvd on this film you'll want to use the fast scan button Â a lot
<START> walking with cavemen hosted by alec baldwin is a look back at all the hominid that's us species of the past 5 million years who they were what they were like and how they died out along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human i waited several weeks to watch this and i was not disappointed
<START> i loved the real mc coys 1957 1963 it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martÃ­nez i loved it when he called amos seÃ±or grampa i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2 6 if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared god bless all the departed members of the cast and please llydia reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real mc coys will live forever
<START> it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you'll still love it all the same
<START> the 60's is a great movie i saw it completely in one night about the hippy movement in the late 60's although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film br br the main character of the movie is michael a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam war there he meets his girlfriend sarah michael's brother brian goes to vietnam to fight what a surprise he comes back from the war and changes in a tom cruise born on the fourth of july look a like and then into a hippy his dad is a pro vietnam war type of guy what a surprise michael's sister kate gets pregnant from a rock roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love the ending is very poor father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy but i let this slip away from my vote the rest of the movie is very good br br the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant all the main events of the sixties are in the movie like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests the summer of love and woodstock look closely for wavy woodstock speaker gravy what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400 000 as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival br br in the end the 60's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade 10 10
<START> i'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of
<START> for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure the story starts at the turn of the century 1900 in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times i e the 1960s br br the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village his son by the local beauty fights the germans during the second world war when he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism br br this film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made it can be seen in three parts
<START> i did enjoy this film i thought it ended up being an old fashioned love story with a few twists i expected him to get the girl i won't tell you if he does or not you will need to watch the movie to find out overall if you are looking to watch a love story this one will suffice
<START> what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show br br i'm sure you've all seen the matrix by now the creators of the matrix say that it is 'anime inspired' just from watching the trailer to this classic you can see where they took the plot from br br the film is sort of set in 1980s japan and it really shows the costumes music and words in the recent english language version by ad vision are all like they've been directly lifted from the era i believe it was made in that time also but due to certain plot points this doesn't date the film br br as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix the world isn't real it's not really the 1980's in fact it's something more like the 2480's after a nuclear war the earth or biosphere prime 's ecosystem was destroyed the survivors we're forced to escape into space where the conflict continued once the planets or biospheres were all abandoned people began to live in megazones cities inside of spaceships where via hypnotism techniques and truman show esque illusion they were made to believe they we're back on earth in the most peaceful time in recent memory the 1980s when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle it leads him to find out more than he's supposed to know the garland a bike which becomes a mech a weapon from the 2400's aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military as more and more is discovered about the megazone the war comes closer to home and due to conflicts between the military and the computer the war comes to the megazone too i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis br br emotions run high in this movie moreso than the matrix you really do believe the war is going on and shogo really does become quite scarred by what he's discovering what starts off as an uber happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality these characters are real people not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet time in the matrix there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy and a war it may just choke you up towards the end i know it did me br br animation is pretty impressive for it's day and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for it's age the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime very cultural be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood there's also an erotic sex scene br br the ending can be seen as a 'there can be no ending' similar to the matrix or supposedly can be followed by the sequel which i haven't yet had the pleasure of watching br br i have to say that this is one of the best animes i've seen in fact one of the best movies i've seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time br br i must recommend the advision dvd as their take on the english language is incredible and does the movie justice and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released which will have the same vocal cast br br all in all megazone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be held highly and should be an essential in any anime fan's collection heck even my mother enjoyed it
<START> i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week and i'm still working off the trauma essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising well acted too natural my problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless bread chewing hags it's rather with the fact that they never warned me the festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguing sounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending gum smacking to come serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews i looked at post fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film br br the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful tousle haired russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following 'well i um thank you very much for coming to see this film and i just wanted to say well it's a very long film it took me four years to make it and it's i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it it is very long thank you for coming ' this is what he said alarm bells should have been ringing 'what's he talking about ' i thought in happy confusion 'this is gonna be fun ' of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again and in the end i can't say i feel in any way improved by the experience yes i absolutely loved the first half hour it was intelligent new and had a lot to say and yes russia is probably in a bad state yes every society has many hidden faces yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard yes yes yes i get all of this really i do but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging try the korean chinese bin jip 3 iron it's artsy and surprising but also to the point and fun
<START> superb i had initially thought that given amrita pritam's communist leanings and dr dwivedi's nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reverse br br kudos to marita pritam for not being pseudo sec and to dr dwivedi to be objective this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it it is also a sad commentary on hindu psyche as they can't stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place i think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt will not be able to ask them to return the houses this apart one has to salute the courage of characters of puro and her bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in india br br no wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women
<START> a series of vignettes most of them spoofing television of the 1970's but also with some digs at the government and corporate america one of the longest segments the dealers is not that funny to me and i don't know what it is parodying some of the others though are absolutely side splitting i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment most of the foul words i know are used in the movie and if you object to full frontal nudity stay away
<START> over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken britain' trainspotting this is england kidulthood football factory kes and from london to brighton br br bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it like the pursuit of happiness br br i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but don't we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot isn't it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner br br i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors like kidulthood football factory but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned
<START> this movie has its ups and downs but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the bads br br what's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue the sounds the lighting am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur and the acting br br what is very good are the highly original storyline the very intense atmosphere the gore factor which is very high and the effects which are done supremely br br so definitely worth watching or maybe even a must see for all you horror and gore fans
<START> daniel day lewis is christy brown a victim of cerebral palsy who uses my left foot to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film the movie also stars brenda fricker as christy's mother ray mcanally fiona shaw and hugh o'conor their brilliant performances great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49 br br brown was born into a lower middle class catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant 22 children in total 13 of whom survived his father considered christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped but he would not permit his son to go into a home the children in the family would bid goodbye to him each day as they went off to school and then his mother would feed him and talk to him br br in the movie fricker conveys the sense of a woman who despite being surrounded by a huge family needs someone to talk to christy doesn't talk back eventually a cart is found for him to ride in and the neighborhood kids all of whom have known him since he was a baby include him in all of their activities the only part of his body that works really well is his left foot and when the kids find out how well he kicks they put him into soccer games for just that purpose one of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him br br there are many powerful scenes but none as powerful as christy writing mother on the floor holding a piece of chalk between his toes he's a true brown his father declares hoisting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub walking into the pub he announces my son's a genius things change when christy grows older because he has a young boy's desires and emotions he develops crushes is rejected and goes more into himself turning to painting eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist eileen fiona shaw at home he falls in love with her when he finds out she's engaged he nearly goes crazy but he survives to live to paint to write three books in total and to love again br br because it's a film by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined brown wasn't actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time which was left out of the movie the therapist eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in christy's life and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind in truth she worked very hard with christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet etc also before mary christy had a 12 year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated my left foot and the typical hollywood ending 9 years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor doesn't finish the story br br despite all of that christy brown's biopic is incredibly powerful all the more so because of two performances hugh o'conor as young christy and daniel day lewis as the adult christy o'conor's facial expression and the way he drags his warped body is gut wrenching one is exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same time br br and what can be said about daniel day lewis one of the greatest actors in the world he brings christy totally to life a fully fleshed out intelligent human being capable of swearing becoming angry bitter drunk pushy lecherous funny and loving a well deserved oscar won in the same year that tom cruise was nominated for born on the fourth of july i remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that cruise was so sensational what was wrong with the academy uh nothing for a change nothing at all br br brenda fricker is amazing as christy's mother who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times the wonderful thing about fricker's performance is that the support love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother the character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother and no matter what even when her husband is out of work throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant whatever she manages she saves money for christy's wheelchair she receives photos of her daughter and the baby she starts building a room for christy in the back of the house all part of a day's work a performance worthy of the oscar she received br br brown's life was more complicated than this inspiring film but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must see
<START> a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic or telepathetic link to a deformed monster kept in the closet br br as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain fondness for it when i grew up in the late 1970s a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tv uncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation who cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is br br the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff there's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way it's not a good movie but is a must see for one time only for horror and gore fans br br also the head's laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldn't die
<START> i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed br br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui hark's vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing action fantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting it's truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weird br br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isn't too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by hand to hand wouldn't really make sense at all br br i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui hark's time tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui hark always attracts something different into h k cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ain't no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but it's special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
