<START> the woman in black 1989 is a tv adaptation of susan hill's modern classic ghost story published only a few years earlier than the film was made sadly this film has not been released on dvd and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs it's availability is in direct contrast to it's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated marshland estate what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest the story is told in a subtle but concise way never being self indulgent flashy or over expositional the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no nonsense approach but it's just what the story needs and why it works so well it's what you don't see that scares having said that there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual and it works to perfection i watched this film during the day and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later if you love being terrified do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black

<START> i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules this movie is aweful from the acting to the non realistic animation to the countless errors i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination can't extend flaps without engines the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground did they forget the spoilers word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a plane movie sorry for the technical rant but i give this movie 1 10
<START> while the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film and what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music gershwin the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art kelly's enthralling choreography including his rapturous pas de deux d'amour really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist
<START> fanfan la tulipe is still gerard philippe's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the french cinema in the 1955 1965 years it made gina lollobrigida a star lollobrigida and philippe would team up again in renÃ© clair s belles de nuit the same year br br fanfan la tulipe is completely mad sometimes verging on absurd henri jeanson's witty lines full of dark irony were probably influenced by voltaire and candide antimilitarism often comes to the fore these draftees radiate joie de vivre and joie de mourir when necessary joy of life and joy of death it becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me king louis xv complains but no matter let's wait for the next time br br a voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride height of irony it's a genuine historian who speaks br br christian jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo accelerated br br remake in 2003 with vincent perez and penelope cruz i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place
<START> gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over 100 million but got blasted by most critics i personally thought this was a great film the story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama my score is out of
<START> scott henderson alan curtis meets a mystery woman fay helm in a bar and invites her to see a show with him she agrees on condition that they don't swap any information about each other not even names sometimes these are the best kind of dates however when he returns to his apartment inspector burgess thomas gomez and his team are waiting for him scott's wife has been murdered his alibi is the mystery woman but no one can remember seeing her and as a result of this scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife his secretary kansas ella raines is not convinced of his guilt and sets out to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty br br this is a good film and the viewer is 100 behind the attempts of kansas to get to the truth we follow her through some memorable scenes eg her pursuit of mac the bartender andrew tombes at night and the claustrophobic venue where cliff the drummer elisha cook jr takes her to hang out drink and dance while he jams with his friends this is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a stand out part of the film as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene ella raines is good in the female lead role and thomas gomez makes a likable policeman alan curtis started well as the confused innocent man but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to kansas for no reason god knows why she stuck by him br br the film doesn't keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film but this doesn't matter in fact it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story as we will kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out it's a good film with some great scenes but although elisha cook jr has a memorable role i just never like him in anything that i see him in someone hand me a neck tie
<START> polyester was the very first john water's film i saw and i have to say that it was also the worst movie i had seen up to that point br br water's group of talent included several people who i am sure worked for food and were willing to say the lines waters wrote every thing about the movie is terrible acting camera editing and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite divine was purely absurd br br that said i have to recommend this film because it is very funny and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor francine her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women's feet at the grocery store her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town her husband is a cackling a hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor francine br br francine's only friend is played by edith massey possibly the worst actress ever edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming br br despite all of francine's travails waters cooks up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone who survives lives happily ever after
<START> i'll be blunt i'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who's not going to take any crap from anyone if any one of the cast members wanted to they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat it was entertaining on mst 3k but don't rent the real version trust me have i ever lied to you
<START> i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was will's best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see something someone that cared about other people more than himself
<START> this movie was way over hyped a lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it's the greatest movie ever done it's just crap on a stick it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and i also don't understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print it will all be done on a computer this was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow
<START> contrary to most other comments about syriana on the imdb web site i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space br br in short this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30 second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so story lines at the audience made for great and clear viewing no sir it does not what does make for great viewing is total clarity precision plots and story lines and characterisations which have a beginning a middle and an end br br this kind of cinematic presentation akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme br br thank goodness then for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers director and actors knew the value of clear story telling diction and acting that meant something br br this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again
<START> the short that starts this film is the true footage of a guy named gary apparently it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where gary works in the town of beaver gary is a little different he is an impersonator and drives an old chevy named farrah after fawcett lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from gary some time later inviting him to return to beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he has put together including gary's staggering performace as olivia newton dawn oh my the two shorts that follow are gary's story the same one you just witnessed only the first is portrayed by sean penn and the second by crispin glover titled the orkly kid if you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch i was doubled over with laughter through most of it especially crispins performance which could definitely stand on it's own when it was over i had to rewind the film to once again watch the real gary and all his shining idiocy although olivia was the focus i would have liked to have seen one of the fictitious shorts take a jab at gary's barry manilow impersonation whic h was equally ridiculous
<START> well i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd when that will happen i don't know but i will grab it when it's released br br in my humble opinion this is errol flynn's most entertaining film especially when gentleman jim corbett's ring career begins in the film then it goes from a good film to a great one br br few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that reportedly this was flynn's favorite role and i believe that you can just sense how much fun he was having here ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l sullivan bond too was never better br br there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done too corbett's family is fun to watch too as they carry on in the stands during jim's matches out of the arena corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion br br and speaking of the conclusion sullivan's speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film some mean spirited critics variety for example didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but duh most films are fictionalized like it or not and in this case it made for a nice story and nice ending in real life corbett was a very soft spoken true gentleman not anything like flynn's portrayal but flynn still make him a good guy br br this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd
<START> this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner another girl that's right they're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through also unfortunately none of this is ever explained where exactly were they where did the demon come from how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit the acting is terrible i think but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap i would not recommend it it wasn't quite bad enough to be funny
<START> there are so many good things to say about this âbâ movie br br âbâ maybe in connections but not in commission this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen a grade a effort by universal the script is well done imaginative and without fault writing credits howard higgin original story douglas hodges story john colton screenplay director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well no skimping on the loads of extras and locations i loved beulah bondy jimmy stewarts mother in âitâs a wonderful lifeâ the fem lead frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in as i said there were so many good things the african discovery of the radium âxâ the melting of the stone statues somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none agatha christie the barry fitzgerald version the glowing of karlof in the dark karloffâs mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance and because of all these virtues i found myself believing in the science it portrayed i guess thatâs the mark of a good piece of art
<START> winchester '73 is a great story and that's what i like about it it's not your everyday western it uses a rifle which passes hands from various characters as a mechanism for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west it's important to note for those politically correct types they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse by today's standards it's still pretty violent but it's a great story and worth watching enjoy
<START> i was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen i thought it was supposed to be a comedy but i only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over what was up with the janitor in heaven scene fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations but this did not work they must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie
<START> rodney dangerfield isn't the main character of this movie he's barely in it most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes one running gag is that a character is named jerk off there are also lots of erection jokes where the punch line is someone has an erection this movie is as funny as kirstie ally's british accent is convincing br br this movie started off like a weak action movie five minutes of back story and then bam unfunny jokes but aside from the terrible writing the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible also this movie does the old bad comedy clichÃ© of having lots of well known b movie actors harland williams gilbert godfried randy quaid and phil la mar these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney even though he's billed as the main character don't be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks even that is too much
<START> first animated feature film from ireland is also one of the best animated films i've ever seen its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year br br the plot of the film has the abbot of kells a village in ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack his nephew brendon is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time when a legendary illuminator aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality much to his uncle's chagrin aiden offers to teach brendon how to illuminate in order to help aidan work on his great book saved from his destroyed monastery brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink while outside the walls he meets ashley a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship unfortunately the abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay but lurking in the distance are the vikings br br forget what you think you know about this film you're wrong even what i've explained doesn't do this film justice its a simple story with so much more going on this is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls as the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn't cease to be even if you build walls br br its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness there is death and destruction and joy and happiness its not sugar coated people die monsters lurk it freaked out some of the kids but in the end there is hope frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent american film forget the sadness in a pixar film this is the real thing and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even pixar has become br br its a genndy tartakovsky esquire samurai jack animated film who's look is actually based upon the the celtic art of the period its a film that looks unlike any other here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible the images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary book of kells its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life br br director tomm moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece i can't say more than that its a masterpiece its one of the best animated films i've ever run across
