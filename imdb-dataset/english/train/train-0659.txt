<START> this rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of john woo's talents the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me nonetheless it's worth seeing especially if you can catch in letterboxed
<START> i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it this was a good hollywood bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach jazz parminder nagra loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet kiera knightlety and joe jonathon rhyes meyers who is her coach when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky archie punjabi's wedding at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play
<START> this movie looked good good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening it went downhill from there why was it filmed by hand held camera it shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer a poor choice indeed as if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all and then it commits the worst sin of all after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending doh this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director
<START> tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting tremendous rapport between its leads and outstanding photography diego peretti stars as dr silverstein a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz luis luque who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy diaz has been suspended from duty but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentina's intelligence community and some uranium and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer though peretti isn't as classically handsome as hill remarkably even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesn't wear out its welcome and indeed writer director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda all in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence
<START> true it does not follow the book very closely but it's still a very entertaining take on the story swayze was far better in the role than i expected and doody avoided the silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness portrayal most of us probably expected cf kate capshaw in indiana jones the temple of doom br br at any rate it's amazingly better than richard chamberlain's awful pair of quatermain flicks br br it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways about the only thing i didn't care for was all the mysticism but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre like how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen heh
<START> absolute garbage the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula but because the plot was just pathetic br br the supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case and neither did anyone else really it was just routine police work utterly tedious br br you sat right till the end hoping for a twist and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment br br there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap could the lt's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement br br all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it but surely a genius like lt c by constant conversation with the wronged husband would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride hides the body and then plants subtle clues it could have been good it was a complete waste of time
<START> my goodness this movie really really shows the talents of actors billy connelly flexes his acting muscle truly an amazing man if you look at him in absolution as a rebel boondock saints as a madman killer and then finally in fido as a zombie his character in fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous cariie ann moss is no hack either jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type casted br br now onto the storyline no spoilers don't worry this movie would make max brooks author of zombie survival guide world war z happy with joy finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy br br if you like zombies if you don't like zombies if you are just bored or if you are too busy go see this movie
<START> i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don't like the story line just a personal preference thank you
<START> maybe not the most original way of telling a story we've seen all this before in many movies but i liked it october sky alot anyways it got something great directing and good acting by all parts especially laura dern the teacher and chris cooper the father i wanna be a rocket engineer
<START> although this show has been off the air since 1973 after viewing a dvd set i borrowed at our library i felt compelled to say a bit about it br br i can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s and sometimes there would be a little sunday night party with friends to watch this on nbc on one of the few color televisions br br i really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time case in point virginia city nevada which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the silver got its name from a character named old virginny who in the town's early days stumbled out of a saloon fell and broke his whiskey bottle br br old virginny didn't want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid was seeping into the dirt he decided to christen the town virginia town the area became known as the comstock lode because another character henry comstock had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim and the area became known as the comstock lode br br i just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects other episodes dealt with mark twain's literary rise while a reporter for the territorial enterprise br br it was wholesome and frequently educational family entertainment as someone else remarked each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right rich scripts and characters br br one thing it twisted the truth on was the proximity to virginia city and the ponderosa in truth to ride from the ponderosa all of northern lake tahoe one would have to ride his horse about 3 000 feet 1 000 meters down the spooner summit to the high desert 3 000 4 000 feet of the carson valley then another 30 40 miles to virginia city br br needless to say the cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis but every writer should have some leeway with the truth br br how i miss that show even today
<START> for a made for tv horror movie the movie started off very interesting i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film but the ending was a total dissappointment the movie was going along fast paced and was building up to it seemed like anyway to a very climatic end but guess what there is no end the movie is just over and after almost one and a half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it very dissappointed this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film a real bomb
<START> those childhood memories when things were new and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life br br one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program galaxy express 999 about a young boy named tetsuro who goes on a train ride around the galaxy in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold hearted trophy gathering mechanical hunters accompanying tetsuro on his journey is maetel a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago br br back in the early 80's as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in seoul south korea galaxy express 999 was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from japan which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them the memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time br br those were some wonderful memories never to be had again br br as i moved to america and while residing here for over 2 decades i sometimes wondered about that time and place in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean of this childhood program with its hit theme song and of the boy named tetsuro his protective companion maetel the enigmatic train conductor and of the spacefaring train galaxy express 999 br br many many years passed br br last summer while i was in korea i was able to track down a copy of the original galaxy express 999 1979 on dvd and it brought back a lot of nostalgic heartfelt memories galaxy express 999 remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life's journey into manhood br br here's to wonderful memories good bye maetel good bye galaxy express 999 br br good bye to my childhood br br 10 10
<START> while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on even my a d d couldn't keep up it felt like a slight acid trip everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything there were so many shapes lines and patterns i really wanted to stop the movie mid way and smash my burned copy of this movie but after i finish watching it i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching br br the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells a small boy brendan is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written this book will contain information that will help change darkness into light brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls taking place in the 8th century brendan's uncle the abbot of kells is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out brendan's uncle insist he help complete the wall but a traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out it's word br br the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn't really understand what was going on i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells after reading many articles my opinion of the movie greatly changed br br the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century along with it's paleographic and insular script the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art a type of early art form know for it's intricacy complexity and miniature illustrations much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors br br the secret of kells is very colorful i originally thought the animation was flat and boring it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and amine look to it once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan's mind whenever he goes into his imagination circular shapes resembling the sun cogs clocks and wheels begin filling the screen the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles transitions are filled with color and celtic knots from the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns br br clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested i think one has to generally be open mined to the secret of kells as half art piece half movie about history despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator it's a very nice looking movie but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration i don't think it was worth being nominated over mary and max br br thatwasjunk blogspot com
<START> this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and that's what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you'll know
<START> this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie in fact when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies they are always good for a laugh believe i know i have seen many but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes which i probably should have there is nothing good about it first and foremost the camera crew suck3d a the intro was stupid just like the ending acting and special effects were terrible please i'm begging you do not watch this movie you will absolutely hate it
<START> so often with stephen king adaptations you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books this really captures the heart of the book maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage dale midkiff and denise tasha yar crosby really act like his parents there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage and they are very natural together fred gwynne is wonderful he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody and is wise and warm just like jud should be 8 out of 10
<START> from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club you know you've got a stinker on your hands this film had potential beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film if not an interesting one the final product is a real mess however aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film christopher lee gives it a nugget of credibility but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap br br having never seen any of the other films in this series this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves the film is paced fairly well and there are not too many dead spots the action is there it just isn't filmed well one bright spot is the music of a punk band called babel though their song is played quite often it is rather catchy br br the problems with this film are great in number first off the acting is worse than pitiful christopher lee is good enough but that's where it ends the two leads reb brown and annie mcenroe are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters the writing is wretched the editing redundant and the direction amateurish there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number sybil danning is nice to look at but her acting performance is less than satisfactory judd omen looks the part he plays but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be latin br br i liked the general idea for the story i always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil one scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting kind of maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling 3 of 10 stars br br the hound br br side note as of this writing the censors at youtube com have still not taken down the ending credits with sybil danning ripping off her top several times while the babel song is playing catch it while you can
<START> the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way br br i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched it br br avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action it's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is rome italy thats the best place ever the actors are great mary kate olsen is such a great actress she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley olsen play leila and thats a great character to love when in rome love it
<START> it's die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to one cop jack crackerjack to stop this br br a b action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action a ridiculous plot as always in these movies and three fine stars thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists if you don't like stupid b action movies this is not for you
