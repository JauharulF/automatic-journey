<START> i realise that the us army was demoralised by 1971 but this film was unbelievable it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel the writer must be a real army hater the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well these men were going overseas the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from and an investigation would have ensued the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one farrell the alleged barrack room lawyer would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention actual assault on an enlisted man sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer intead he just walks away after this discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable i don't know how it ended i went to bed
<START> most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air force in which a b 17 nearly single handedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departure scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true
<START> maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best jackie chan's movies but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made there also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film
<START> it really doesn't matter that superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old what matters is that superman returns is bad movie br br in the beginning a question for you dear readers how many of you actually believe that superman will be defeated by bald kevin spacey anyone just as i thought no spoilers here so let's get to some major issues right now br br firstly this movie looks like commercial scene in the bar with superman clark kent drinking budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to imagine commercial of superman two and half hour long let's be serious this isn't amadeus or the departed you actually feel that this movie is way too long and special effects are not so special by the way br br secondly scenario is silly sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic in cinema it looks just stupid and it's like that in this case of course dialogs are disgrace i can't believe somebody took money to write them how many times we will be fed with villain making speeches how many times laws of physics will be raped jesus it's not only the matter of superman's strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with how many times lois lane will be fooled by kent how many times hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books since there's hard to make a good story why having a weak story for a starter it just doesn't work guys get a grip try harder please or just stay on this strike forever who cares i got the feeling that wga is permanently on strike no offense i'm not questioning the lame money those people are paid but the quality of the product they deliver in this case there is no quality at all at this point you may ask yourself is it that bad yes it is br br thirdly acting is weak which is quite a surprise since bryan singer usual suspects is directing kevin spacey is having fun but he's the only one audience is rather not in the mood for jokes thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality with clear motivations but also with doubts fears some depth in this case nobody did that job and characters aren't really interesting br br finally whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody second unit is so bad that attracts attention since there's nothing interesting going on on screen anyway the harder they try if they try the funnier it gets but it isn't laugh you could expect br br final conclusion one word shame br br this particular movie ladies and gents is camp don't waste your time and don't waste your money too stay home read a book
<START> this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it doesnt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light i give this movie a 10 it has great actors realistic scenes and excellent writers
<START> bill maher's religulous is not an attack on organized religion it's an attack on christianity and islam apart from ridiculing a bunch of rabbis inventing warped machines to get around sabbath regulations he really doesn't attack judaism and seems enraged when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of israel if bill maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion this is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film br br i find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid what makes him the rational person in the room in a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people br br if you want to watch a good movie documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization watch richard dawkins' 'root of all evil ' it is a brilliantly researched documentary clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how br br bill maher's religulous is not funny poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic it seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his catholic upbringing i almost feel sorry for him
<START> i found this a good movie to pass your time but not by any chance of any historical value the portrayal of cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera br br the twist of the facts is funny she gave birth while feeding her people o please a pregnant queen of egypt especially this one would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason they tried to make her appear a saint for god's sake and the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister beyond description br br cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals she did everything for only two reasons power and self preservation she was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival something she did very well anything that stood on her way was either murdered her brothers and sister or seduced ceasar and mark anthony br br unfortunately octavian was too powerful to kill and too gay to be seduced so he was her end
<START> i generally love these 1930 mystery police charlie chan type of movies and this is no exception however something seems bad with this movie a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real but a commonplace occurrence
<START> well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean haven't we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i've seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one br br there is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you don't even now who has been killed and who has not and you don't care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie br br stay as far away from this movie as possible 2 10
<START> this movie shows us nothing original every idea or action scene can be found in many previously released movies fabulous nick is completely plain here even will patton is calm and evil nor good mr duvall is ok but has a very small part so does angelina so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom overall there are too many characters so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed this makes the movie easy to forget too bad don't you think
<START> this movie rocks jen sexy as ever and polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on dvd soon or it will become a classic i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on jen now i am too old but to this movie is made for all gens you know i come from the early 80 s area were i had to watch everyone els live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but reborn to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about hormones and datting problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but don't mean nothan now so this movie is a dating tool
<START> i recently viewed manufactured landscapes at the seattle international film festival i was drawn to the movie as a photographer because i'm both familiar and a fan of burtynsky's work while i believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across i couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by burtynsky obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them while this is a good effect when used economically i felt like 75 of the movie was just stills from burtynsky's book which i already own that's probably an exaggeration but that's how i felt if you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one
<START> at first glance this documentary fiction cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking of course when something provokes thought it can then be scrutinized the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions the link that what the bleep would have you see between science and spirituality is in fact not rooted in science at all the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area washington d c in this case in reality the hra homicides rapes and assaults crime rate was about 30 higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988Â1992 there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study in fact each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked br br my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke either way i suggest that you do not waste your time br br if you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts you might consider mindwalk 1990
<START> i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the grinch charlies angels the 6th day unbreakable here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks glorious scenes wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason robert deniro deserves an oscar nod if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package this would be the film
<START> to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it that's how i watch movies whenever possible no preconception i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something i was wrong kinda br br loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do br br another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ these kinds of things do happen i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are implausible really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is life br br i highly recommend this movie
<START> well if you like pop punk punk ska and a tad bit of modern psycho billy then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching this movie has tons and tons of band cameos along with president of troma lloyd kaufman as a semi major role and lots of goofy death scenes sounds like it may be good right well the deaths keep coming and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event some of the deaths start of stylish but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive almost everyone dies of having their head smashed or intestines being pulled from their stomach the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas' zombie 90 extreme pestilence with this being the watered down type blood but now that movie is actually decent and provides humor something that this movie terribly lacks sure the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma it's got great low budget potential and it tries but just too hard everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie and thats what brings it down everything tries to be too comic and goofy by using intentional bad acting an overuse of pointless deaths and doing the same thing over and over it's basically mulva zombie ass kicker chairman of the board or any movie you have made with your friends it's funny to those who made it and that's about it br br great potential great idea great use of effects but it's the same thing over and over a band plays a band dies fans die everyone dies blood is sprayed everywhere the process is repeated br br the question is for these types of movies which is basically 'bad slap stick' do they try too hard or not at all
<START> horrendous avoid like the plague i would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever special effects acting mood sound etc appear to be done by day care students wait i have seen programs better than this opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there good nude scenes but that is it sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie at times i would swear i could hear the roaring of the camera motors yikes i would like to see another movie on this story but done by different people this batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons voted 1 out of 10
<START> ridiculous this movie is actually a vehicle for the ramtha school of enlightenment if you are wondering who the bleep ramtha is ramtha is a 35 000 year old spirit warrior who appeared in j z knight's kitchen in tacoma washington in 1977 knight claims that she is ramtha's channel she also owns the copyright to ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks hollywood's version of elizabethan english in a guttural husky voice she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as ramtha at seminars 1 000 a crack and at her ramtha school of enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and accessories clark and gallo 1993 she must have hypnotic powers searching for self fulfillment otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold muddy doorless maze john wheeler one of america's finest theoretical physicists would roll his eyes about this movie he has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory this movie does the same thing as those fools br br there is a great review of this movie at skeptico i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers br br http skeptico blogs com skeptico 2005 04 what the bleep html i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt it will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage thinking of this movie
<START> i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch up to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears wannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spears induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie
<START> when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess 2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot br br the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily blunt the devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable br br to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie br br but overall it's a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt
