<START> page 3 is a great movie the story is so refreshing and interesting not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space konkana sen did a good job in the movie although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better but she did do a great job all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along boman irani did a great job there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great and very realistic it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message i think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over they are getting hard to digest now everyone should watch page 3 it is a great film just my 2 cents
<START> maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job to do what she did with no budget wow thats all i can say really really good like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away i definitley suggest checking it out if you can great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse see it
<START> this movie brought tears to my eyes john roberts really knew how to get to viewers' hearts directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie we discover from time to time with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john that even small creatures like paulie have a heart i just couldn't stop my tears even though the film has a happy end this is great after thousands of films i saw through my life paulie really touched me deeply this is after the ugly duckling the second picture that really turned me upside down
<START> dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichÃ©s man and woman fall in love and marry husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no 1 reappears the movie is reminiscent of yash chopra's chandni and countless others divya bharti and shah rukh khan give good performances amrish puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain the music by nadeem shravan is superb all the songs were brilliant my favourites are sochenge tumhe pyar or koyi na koyi chahiyye dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions
<START> it must have been several years after it was released so don't know why it was at the movies but as a kid i enjoyed it i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again it's been a lot of years i wasn't expecting much now knowing how the b movies were made at that time but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired surprisingly the writing wasn't bad either forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning because then the story would have ended right ok the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary they didn't even scare me as a kid however making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes it was a job well done by all i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns j farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as lisbeth searcy in old yeller some of the mole men were famous too jerry maren has played mayor mccheese for mcdonalds little oscar mayer was the munchkin that handed dorothy the lollipop was on a seifeld episode and a wealth of other work billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high plains drifter was one of the friends met by the star in incredible shrinking man he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal sal with rita hayworth wizard of oz and plenty of other parts great actor john brambury was also a munchkin phillis coates who played lois lane in this movie was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as superman clark kent was superman he did a great job of playing the strong man bottom line to all i've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie but it was the 50's and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space it is definitely worth seeing there isn't a bad actor in the group whomever put the cast together was very very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience but all were gifted so if you get a chance to see the film forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting is it a bird is it a plane no just a good old fashioned movie to enjoy
<START> this is a mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood if you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this the acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks but the movie isn't a complete waste of time the special effects are actually quite good and the gore is well done it reminded me of the remake of the blob probably because of the sliminess of it all all in all you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time but i wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing
<START> this film has over the past ten years become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures the domestic chitchat between bel geddes and widmark the movement between rooms the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife all are well crafted and natural more than anything else i love their porch that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and douglas' characters it may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all it comes across as real respectful and efficient the third thread the grungy tale of blackie and his tattered little gang gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world palance's blackie is as cold as a block of ice this self proclaimed business man this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to for me this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience
<START> im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7 10 br br the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie br br its a good rental br br 7 10
<START> i can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting a love divided shows it's true face the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent so far from attempting art this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library
<START> this film is pure distilled unadulterated boredom i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room took my seat i was seduced by the mysterious and suspenseful blurb on the poster i suppose also lena headey is nice and unconventionally sexy and richard jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around so the cast seemed reasonable it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on i should've gone to see valkyrie for the second time instead br br the thin plot revolves around headley's gina mcvey her boyfriend her father her sister and her sister's husband who for some reason are being stalked in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash there could be a great film behind this idea not exactly an original idea mind you but still and in fact if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to headey's character's story the broken could've made a reasonable 20 minute short as it is it is desperately unmotivated and boring and terribly inconsistent br br for instance in one scene a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters they look puzzled but quickly forget about it in another scene a mirror smashes in an empty room and a doppelganger is visible as she steps out of the shards left hanging on the wall so why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out just for a little thrill there are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly lit london flats peering around corners cos they thought they heard something but seeing nothing there and moving on we begin to wonder why doesn't this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience but we the audience will need to start threatening each other in the darkness of the theater if we want to have any thrills during the broken by the way once we've spent time with these evil doubles we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them they just stand around blank looks on their faces perhaps totally harmless after killing their others br br there are some nice moods and touches throughout and i dare say director sean ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time
<START> new york i love you or rather should be titled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy talk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books while the latter isn't a great story by any stretch it's at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl he's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or for that matter hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites br br what's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another i e bits involving bradley cooper drea dematteo hayden christensen andy garcia james caan natalie portman etc it's not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx not even say harlem or washington heights lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some it's the lack of imagination that one found in spades for better or worse in paris j'taime it's mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst the julie christie shia labeouf segment it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling br br so basically wait for tv and do your best to dip in and out of the film in that is for three scenes the aforementioned bloom christina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment yes x men 3 brett ratner with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary everything else can be missed even natalie portman's directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother only one allan to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left
<START> wow i loved this movie it is about normal life in a small village about hypocrisy and honesty love and surrender great it is about things everybody encounters in life you have to do things with passion but some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you there are people who find the opinion of others and 'what will the neighbors think' more important than to follow their heart don't let anybody's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion i loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people it could have been my family no big beauties but all people you fall in love with during the movie
<START> stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right br br below average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being midkiff's worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i can't completely dismiss it at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred gwynne as the wise old aged neighbor and brad greenquist as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film br br king has his usual cameo as the minister br br followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since br br 4 10
<START> there are movies that are awful and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long forgotten and unwatchable also lots of violence and bad stuff not just cheesy stuff you know what i mean add to the mix as well what is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content why final justice of course br br remember mitchell joe don baker was the star of that movie and that was riffed by joel and the bots on mystery science theater 3000 now this time with mike taking joel's place on the satellite of love but with the same bots that trio got to make fun of mst3k's second joe don baker movie final justice of course much of the naughty stuff that i mentioned was removed for television release but still i want to watch that episode and mitchell as well because what does joe don hate the most why none other than mystery science theater 3000 br br p s if you have a big lots nearby check that store for the uncut tape lol that happened to another user
<START> filmatography excellent nice camera angles i don't remember seeing a movie of late with good close ups until this one could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera ny is pictured good i liked the upside down angles in particular a different touch br br music not impressive songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like anniyan a disappointment br br actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard core action sequences his age and belly really show up also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward it was a very awkward to see a mature aged star still trying to play like a 20 heroes scenes love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much for example the love expressed by rajinikanth in chandrmukhi br br jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie not sure why she accepted this well that is not my problem i guess br br others just have a small presence br br direction i expected gautham to excel or measure up to his other movie kakka kakka he disappointmented me it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues he slips in few scenes even abvious things got slipped from a famous director br br overall just a okay movie too much graphics definitely not for kids and adults who expect some kind of entertainment br br thx
<START> with a title like that it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me granted there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse shock tactics the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her a grabby neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss he explains to her that he is going to kill them all she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she tortures and kills herself most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh t eating and genitalia destroying all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man rape surely i spit on your corpse i p ss on your grave was intended as an unofficial sequel to i spit on your grave based on mainly the title and a reference the main character gives suggesting her mother was camille keaton i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion this movie is a boring amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably
<START> i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual br br the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers bulldozed and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombies br br from this point on it's chunk city the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll br br ok it's not great art but this one with its in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip
<START> splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix mystery thriller musical briefly we are allowed to tell about the story a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic in a no time no place way vigalondo managed a delight in b w by means of imagination and despite thanks to the tightest of budgets br br because of the unity of time space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem almost a haiku spain land of quick poetry in b w Â¿remember the early buÃ±uel br br a must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states
<START> this movie has problems in its presentation may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith and third is the humanity of jesus the tension of the christ betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ when judas takes his own life the viewer can sense the angst peter's denial and guilt however moving are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ whether believable or not i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs to use in study or discussion groups
<START> star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways first it's a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to as mickey judy once put it put on a show it's definitely friends neighbors to you can tell a lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen or the youngest or the thinnestÂ some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on marblesÂ some of them have thick accents or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they're saying still you have to admit for everything these friends neighbors have put together it's actually fun to watch yes some of the dialogue is hokey yes it's a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two starfleet males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st tos tng other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show okay we can get by that why the graphics are first rate better than almost anything you've seen and sometimes a show or two really stands out story wiseÂ some of them are actually real tear jerkers br br hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the wordÂ but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude people sets costumes graphicsÂ it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts we watch we return and we thank them
