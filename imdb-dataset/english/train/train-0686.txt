<START> the events of the 11th of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we ve seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9 11 was haunting and dignified br br as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed fellowship of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander but went to an an all american nice guy instead the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to fellowship were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor both correct calls
<START> blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasn't that good first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s also blank check won't be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's films i wouldn't call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6 blank check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original everything just makes you go what haven't i seen this before blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from richie rich to home alone which strangely enough both have macaulay culkin in it blank check isn't a bad movie but it deserves to fade into obscurity

<START> the 60s 1999 d mark piznarski josh hamilton julia stiles jerry o'connell jeremy sisto jordana brewster leonard roberts bill smitrovich annie corley charles s dutton nbc mini series later released to video dvd as full length feature film about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family the film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families however dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half rating 4 out of 10 not rated later rated pg 13 for video dvd release
<START> cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael curtiz at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best a forerunner to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out
<START> this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie say it is why first is the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront as one of the plot elements the issue of domestic violence so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points second without the plot element of prince's movie relationship with his abusive father the musical climax wouldn't work as well as it does so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have once again missed one of the points specifically why it is so good because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective third give this movie a break for first time movie producers and director this is just not that bad there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people and last the reviewers who say that the music is good have also missed the point check out the range of stylistic musical treatments the variety the musicianship and the stage performance of prince truly one of a kind going musically where no one else was going during the 1980's and with a style seen in the work of other artists clothes and movement which costuming elements came first michael jackson's or prince's also see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie long before quentin tarentino's pulp fiction as the sum of its parts not a bad movie at all
<START> i'm not sure how i missed this one when it first came out but i am glad to have finally seen it br br this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho japan it tells the tale of prostitution caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan br br it is uniquely akira kurosawa even though he died before he could direct this movie his adaptation of the screenplay shows his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other the characters may revolve around each other but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute's world goes back to his life while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system lowest of the low many prize the world of the samurai above all others but yet it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones br br the movie deserves a higher rating it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan during this time frame men were thought to be the survivors the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has br br i recommend the sea is watching to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if they're not a fan it is a lovely quiet and soul sustaining movie and one to be treasured for any movie collection

<START> thanks should be given to the hong kong vcd dvd distributors that i only paid us 1 4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment br br adultery how common in our modern days eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy she wants her revenge done but at the end she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nick br br in this small indie production vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fast food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical mental and technology areas conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growth br br most viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together well this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses however i want a sequel i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange perhaps they may exchange back how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationship br br good acting and good scenery the two little child actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia and of course how can we forget the bella bella scenery of the city
<START> welcome to collingwood offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory watching this comedy directed by the brothers anthony and joe russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past but since we missed the opening credits we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of was the 1958 italian film big deal on madonna street directed by mario monicelli br br the russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film anything with william h macy luis guzman sam rockwell patricia clarkson the late michael jeter in it can't be bad since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine br br the film presents us a group of inane would be safe crackers from hell no one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake whatever could go wrong and more is what they succeed in doing george clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of cossimo's funeral br br the best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax and let all these small time crooks do their thing let their funny lines make you laugh as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end
<START> this movie was on british tv last night and is wonderful strong women great music most of the time and just makes you think we do have stereotypes of what older people ought to do and there are fantastic cameos of the sensible but worried children getting near to my best movie ever
<START> having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland premier last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeter's as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
<START> this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see terrible terrible terrible any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker the filmmakers family or a friend of the filmmaker how does this film suck let us count the ways br br the plot incoherent dialogue atrocious i will not slam the effects gore as i understand that this is low budget but was there even one zombie that was not obese c'mon and for a film set in rhode island why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate continuity find some br br the girl dancing while the soldier stands at attention please don't put your ex girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover next time you decide to make a movie don't
<START> a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the 90's which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland's robbie coltrane however this one off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus coltrane isn't really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored the ex soldier's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane's family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two hour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90's which is far far superior
<START> not your typical vamp story not bram stoker or anne rice here a truly original vampyre story these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight don't bother they are pure evil to br br the film is not perfect many of the actors are clearly amateurs the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution
<START> george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't but this show is a work of art it's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it and jokes that re memorable at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an dyslexic teenager i don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job if they had just continued the show i'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good traditional comedy then george lopez is the show for you the one bad thing is the title george lopez really imagine the fresh prince of bel air being will smith c'mon man but otherwise this show is genius 10 10
<START> an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's audiences must've been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle quite a contrast from his public enemy 2 years earlier cagney does add spark interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline plot but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back first with the conservative honeymoon hotel number then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling by a waterfall sequence followed by the closing shanghai lil sequence cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler the shanghai lil number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind boggling by a waterfall choreography if i was the director i would've inserted the shanghai lil number in the middle close with by a waterfall which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak in my view the best of the 3 numbers the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake james cagney's performance is added decoration to the cake an outstanding musical achievement a 4 star movie the ultimate musical well worth watching you won't be disappointed
<START> the reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist robert james waller also author of bridges of madison county the writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible a failing coupleÂa blocked american writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedÂare swept up by a strong self directed criminal and after a few adventures mostly terrifically violent alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of scott glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of giovanna zacarÃ­as as luz and not even the stalwart performance of harvey keitel as the cia specialist assigned to track the killer down a serious waste of time
<START> for the most part on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen and already have an opinion on it was either this or invinicible i like mark wahlberg movies which i haven't seen and i was actually in a movie watching mood which doesn't happen often anymore because i've already watched all the movies i own a million times and that's a lot of movies and i don't have much interest in new movies and boy this movie made me regret it i'm not going to put in any spoilers i'm just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half way decent i think the main girl the dead one who kills everyone is very annoying looking but convincing i'd take her for psycho bitch anyday so she fits her roll well though it is lame the blood isn't that great only a few of the kills or may i say woundings are alright but you don't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off and being a band member the 'recording' parts weren't very interesting either though what happened would truly happen when going about recording i'm done if you want to watch this suit yourself
<START> just came out of a sneak preview for this film it had me laughing every 30 secs the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke there are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron burgendy in their movies paul rudd is hilarious as always i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like p s i think that seth rogen should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac however if you're easily offended don't see this movie if you're a rabid feminist don't see this movie and please not matter what even if you think you're one of those hip parents don't take your kids to this movie sure you should let your teens go see this movie just don't watch it with them it would make for some incredibly awkward moments
