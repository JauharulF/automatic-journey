<START> while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti vietnam while watching it i didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support it showed their fear their desperation their drive all of it out in the open naked as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military especially boot camp on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film 10 10
<START> simply put oliver is one of the greatest musicals of all time it is filled with memorable songs food glorious food oliver consider yourself and oom pah pah to name just a few and equally memorable characters br br the film is a musical adaptation of charles dickens' classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself it is a perfect family film there are some frightening moments the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults br br the story which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question mr bumble the overseer he is sold to a family as a servant br br after a series of mishaps and close shaves he meets the artful dodger superbly played by a young jack wild who gives his all in the role and through him the greedy fagin ron moody who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself br br the film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at shepperton film studios but this does not translate at all to film the sets perfectly replicate victorian london as do the costumes worn by the characters a multi oscar winner and a massive success on its release oliver is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film
<START> this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species br br this should be banned and destroyed i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market br br this movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help
<START> i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture the dated aspect aside jigsaw suffers from many problems including overwrought acting silly and stilted dialogue lsd flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is on paper a great vehicle to do just that and an ending that is so trite and predictable not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows that the climax is actually an anti climax if it was a better movie we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out at very best a three out of 10
<START> after seeing the low budget shittier versions of the universal soldier franchise i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie well it seemed this prayer was answered but not the way i hoped universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library no even that would be more intriguing the fight sequences are top notch bruce lee quality which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture that and having former wcw tough guy legend goldberg playing the villain however placing goldberg as seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better br br we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself it's like some film school students slapped it together the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west's ego is what really did this movie in for example luc's daughter hillary looks like she's at least 11 13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago how is that possible tell me that the part in which luc's partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re goddamn diculous you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie c'mon the director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut but oooh nooo br br speaking of the plot it sucks compared to the first movie universal soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless where's the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something this was the dawn of the millennium you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia orwellian type of future cesspit corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad sad sad sequel br br from what i seen double impact under siege 2 robocop 3 and hell even the cheap ass no class terminator knock off class of 1999 is more entertaining than this
<START> for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films the western assault on traditional serbian values it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives this continuous theme expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle is one that kusturica has elected to mandate since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground' kusturica's films' 'black cat white cat' 'life is a miracle' and recently with 'promise me this' his slapstick carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of balkan culture its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom in the case of 'promise me this' the paradoxical world of city urban space and village traditional idiom space are contrasted the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting organized crime sexual exploitation a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values as expressed toward the young kid villager the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one way dirt road they are on a collision coarse appropriately the wedding which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village i e traditional values are about to collide with the funeral mourners exemplifying the death of tradition within this context yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique stylistic singularity with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal
<START> this is what the musical genre was made of humor talent romance and action all rolled into one br br frank sinatra was wonderful nothing else needs to be said marlon brando although not a singer did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson the fact that he couldn't sing added to his character the ladies in the film were alright but the men in the movie definitely stole the show br br it is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh br br definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed
<START> i've now seen this film twice and i must say i enjoyed it both times it's fast paced and fun but ultimately daft having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original it is clear for those who have seen the awful 'zombie creeping flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to bruno mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to fulci this is not idle fulci sycophancy the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in mattei's case br br the film is centered around the outbreak of a virus oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere in south east asia the virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected asians br br the film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves they do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety so well rendered in the original and probably fulci's creation here the other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims martial arts skills aren't their only talents either they are well versed in guerilla tactics hiding on rafters and under bales of hay and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves this is all definitely the work of mattei br br there is a third more chatty variety of zombie this type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'i'm really thirsty for your blood' the ridiculous twist at the end in which the dj turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the wtf factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution br br then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks' br br the characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect but its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro and one of the only effective scenes in the film br br the guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic the scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together ' br br there are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however in an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric diffused light the silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her his sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film the before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance there is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead and this is quite tense things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs but this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been br br all in all i would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film if nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that i've come to expect from just about anything italian and gory from the eighties
<START> fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression when people were having a tough time worldwide finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table in europe hitler was on the rise along with other nationalist socialist whackjobs in the united states seeds of the cartel sown with the federal reserve act and the income tax amendment 16 were beginning to bear fruit for connected finance capitalists and their dominating secret societies br br for the average guy and girl times were tough enter hollywood with at least some hopeful imagesÂi don't think we can properly call them propaganda at this point even though this particular movie revolves around war preparatory naval exercises the real issue for boys and girls then as now was how to hook up with the right one lead a decent life have wonderful children with a modicum of grace and elegance br br the odds were long br br br br for my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site thecoffeecoaster com br br brian wright copyright 2007
<START> oh so familiar comedy story about low key nice guy paul jason lee who after the night of his bachelor party wakes up in bed with becky julia stiles an attractive blonde he met just the night before after lying about it to his fiancÃ©e karen selma blair he's forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks br br i'm sure most of us have been witness to a story like this at least once before on film or on tv the movie is formulaic and extremely predictable with an ending you may see coming a mile away br br at least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable lee is just right in the lead and stiles is a lot of fun in a light hearted comedic role different from the very serious roles she usually plays becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes br br but you know this isn't exactly well written at least one question is left unanswered for what exactly is ray lochlyn munro becky's brutal ex boyfriend being investigated by the i a br br and i didn't like the character of buck david koechner paul's stepfather he's a super obnoxious moron who got on my nerves so quickly i was begging for somebody to punch him br br add another debit a gratuitous uncredited cameo by comic actor larry miller once again playing a grouch in this case it's a little justified his character is an ultra conservative minister br br not good at all but as usual for me i give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone
<START> the premise is simple this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport then things take a 180 degree turn br br i for one really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater and it is my humble opinion that wes craven based on his previous meta horror films sceam does too br br following this logic it's not surprising to find that craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love' story only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar coated dreamworld br br the scope of his character jackson ripner jack the ripper get it lame right in this film is impressive he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko which is a plus in my book as he proceeds to freak out his victim jennifer garner lookalike rachel mcadams who i found pretty annoying by the way you can't help but sympathize with the guy br br this is wes craven embodied in jackson ripner through cillian murphy bashing all brainless chick flicks br br mr craven i salute you br br best quote br br jackson ripner after beating the snot out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet thanks for the quickie
<START> stunning absolutely stunning this is a movie about two kids who's father suddenly has a vision he claims an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill demons he gets instructions later and they start rounding up the demons which are to the naked eye ordinary people they kill these so called demons with an ax to the head and chop them up burying them in the rose garden their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them the movie continues with a twist at the end br br the thing that i love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception is their father completely mad or is he telling the truth the audience is left to decide go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie now
<START> enter the fat dragon is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend just like tang lung of way of the dragon wherever sammo goes trouble starts therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences luckily sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol bruce lee he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell he also uses nunchucks in a scene it was like watching a fat bruce lee there's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one sort of like the game of death where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another br br this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i've seen excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there 8 5 10
<START> based on ray russell's dark bestseller this john watcher in the woods hough directed bust has little going for it br br though it does not lack gory violence it lack narrative sensibility and characters br br the incubus of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse or to be more precise rape br br john cassavetes moonlighting from his successful directing career is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women br br horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage br br the script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid big schlong on the loose exercise
<START> when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview its stunning and then when it comes out you hear nothing and totally miss it and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it man on fire was one of those movies i was curious on a rental one time and i decided to take it home with me my precious blockbuster rental in my hands i watched it and witnessed such a beautiful movie it is like none other drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique unlike another movie the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices and the music is very intriguing for the setting i got into this movie and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy i've watched it several times now denzel washington creasy does an amazing job with becoming this lost minded ex special forces man with no reason to live dakota fanning pita puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start they bond and become good friends until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood la hermandad creasy denzel tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers fearing that pita is dead this is where creasy really shows the person he can become he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit my favorite line of all is in this movie when christopher walken tells the afi agent that a man is a work of art in anything that he does cooking whatever creasy's art is death he's about to paint his masterpiece he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend after finally pursuing the brother of the voice leader of la hermandad creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother in the end creasy dies from being shot earlier and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss it is a very sincere and sad ending but a great one i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick the story is in depth everything is explained from beginning to end and nothing corny at all in any way or manner
<START> scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesn't suddenly become good lester's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell br br co written co produced directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i don't remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible the script by itier bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick we've seen it all before we've seen killer scarecrows before we've seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before we've seen incompetent small town sheriff's make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible character's awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it ' the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting the kills are forgettable you know i'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn br br director itier doesn't do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also i'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kung fu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners twirl around a bit don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know he's a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day there's no nudity the gore isn't anything to write home about there's a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in people's heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth br br with a supposed budget of about 250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didn't waste any time on unimportant things like story character development technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous don't get me started on his accent br br scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988 not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer 2003 scarecrow gone wild 2004
<START> i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70's crown international drive in sexploitation comedy cheese on dvd it's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70's vibe to it it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail sure it's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic the main teen goofus character bobby hamilton gets the girls the respect of his friends and a chance to show up a local van racing bully but it's way too dopey and good natured to hate stuart getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead deborah white as the main object of getz's affection is a definite cutie connie lisa marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe and sneering beefcake neanderthal stephan oliver a 60's biker movie perennial is wonderfully hateful as the brutish dugan hicks a pre stardom danny devito in particular is an absolute riot as getz's cranky carwash owner boss andy a lovably cantankerous ne'er do well slob who wears very ugly loud hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit i especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat danny up one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over danny's torso and sammy johns' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week in short it's great groovy retro 70's fun
<START> i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of gerry andersen's marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it br br i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble br br instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the breakout part was lady penelope and parker i didn't care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show br br i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets br br but then i'm just a big kid
<START> eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non professionals eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot br br the native eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape when an eskimo man loses his mate it is natural that other men share their women with their friend it is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse all of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding arctic setting the trusting eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers with heavy european accents that do not view these natives as their equals deceit drunken orgies rape and death occur after the eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas eventually the lead eskimo mala realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge the audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters br br enter the royal canadian mounted police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back mala for trial the mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case will the mounties get their man is it fair to hold mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society is there a way out that does not punish mala is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail is there no hope for innocence br br this is not a great movie but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting i suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film so beware of the raw nature sequences highly recommended
<START> a must see film with great dialogues great music great acting and a superb atmosphere br br in the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of antwerp they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird that's how i love them br br i'm not going to say anything else just go see and enjoy it
