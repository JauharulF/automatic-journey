<START> by 1909 d w griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and Â working at a rate of two or three per week Â was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker 'the sealed room' is a very interesting 11 minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poe's 1846 short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wife's infidelity br br set in medieval times 'the sealed room' begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dove cote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each other's company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the specially built room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed down br br d w griffith always had an eye for acute detail and 'the sealed room' is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy long takes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon Â parallel to the progressively darker subject matter Â he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of cross cutting Â that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the king's ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it all br br despite these innovations 'the sealed room' suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly
<START> this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of puns is very tight the cast are superb and the plot is highly original br br don't take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself
<START> i found this movie boring monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried shallow upbeat ending that didn't ring true to the overall story following these characters through a weekend of awful events unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable interesting movie and i got very tired of its one note theme and couldn't wait for it to end in fact i almost stopped about halfway through the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant though the acting was good a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal sorry but it just didn't make it with me and i love good small films this one just didn't jell though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would i was disappointed especially after two local reviewers put it on their year's 10 best list i'd strongly recommend watching the house of sand instead now there's a good small film
<START> director ron atkins is certifiably insane this ultra low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo john giancaspro who also co wrote a nut job who receives a rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs rape and kill not always in that order what starts off as being a balls to the wall exploitation film well stays like that but it gets very repetitive very fast i'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane it is hard to forget once seen though kinda like if tom green ever did a horror film br br my grade f br br eye candy laurie farwell gets fully nude jasmin putnam shows tits and bush br br anti eye candy seeing john completely naked repeatedly
<START> i love horror films low budget 50's 60's 70's 80's but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let's compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better though still far from great demon seed ok i'll be fair let's compare it to made for tv horror films don't go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salem's lot the night stalker night gallery even don't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it's a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity it's a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie margaret our protagonist now that i'm on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her's life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that's where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less
<START> watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting directing cinematography editing writing i was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and i have watched it several times since br br everything about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman even though i know this movie well i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences br br it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools br br 10 10
<START> the book on which this movie is based was excellent it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq's unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author's world of sadness in fact no other book has affected me so much this is not necessarily a good thing it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed this is a movie which reveals today's society for the lowly male in all its horror hopefully things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie it's probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again one is enough for any man
<START> if you hit your teens in the 70s as i did you probably remember the stories about studio 54 whether or not you liked disco an exclusive club it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self absorption there's even an excellent vh1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film br br sadly this isn't it 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees a bartender named shane ryan phillippe a busboy named greg breckin meyer his wife a coat check girl anita selma hayek and of course the master of ceremonies himself steve rubell mike meyers while the goings on at the club are well represented this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers following shane's story the closest br br the movie works in spurts sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who 'errol flynt' is and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama some of that is inherent in the premise Â following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous Â but a lot of it is due to the kid gloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for over the top spectacle and his exclusive hand picking of the crowds each night the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on and rubell himself while his excesses are mentioned come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar a cheat a drug abuser and promiscuous as all hell not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd br br meyers does his best to capture rubell but he's given so little to work with here it's surprising his performance is effective but he's good and he helps to anchor the film philippe whom i find generally to be a good actor is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character he's limited to a deer in the headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown and even he can't translate that into a strong performance hayek and meyer are both okay again undercut by the writing and neve campbell Â prominently featured on the dvd cover Â appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo br br for some reason i still find myself interested even fascinated by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies but even given that this is not a film that particularly engaged me despite a predisposition to like it i'd say if that era or that club has any interest for you track down the vh1 special rather than this middle of the road melodrama
<START> br br an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out br br this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema long thought lost a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it which fits perfectly with the images it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary director kinugasa claimed he never saw the german film however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing and chilly portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum to achieve this the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view tilted camera angles fast and slow motion expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others it is also a very complicated film to follow as it has not got intertitles br br the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital wind shaking trees and of thunder the unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them a former dancer the combination of sounds produced by rain wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic almost hypnotic dance in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance she is being watched by other inmates multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients' point of view and their confused view of the world br br these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients' subconscious and view of the sane world br br in three words a must see
<START> all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don't get it this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker karel zeman if you want to know what i'm talking about i suggest you get any of zeman's films such as the fabulous world of jules verne baron munchausen journey to the beginning of time or on the comet if you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in amg they will explain the processes used if one were to look at zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day because both zemen and hines do not compute they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job it isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow i thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made hines took a great gamble and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work regarding the actors i think hines also took a page from zemen's book in that many of zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it
<START> please do not waste any money on this movie it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids i couldn't finish watching it and usually i like watching all kinds of b movies how on earth could they find a distributor for it funny however check out wikipedia for dark area the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind maybe he got loads of money from the producers money that should have been spend on actors camera and editing even that wouldn't have helped since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film unfortunately dark area has already gotten too much attention please director producer and author of this movie stop making movies like that you are not doing yourself a favor the world would be a better place without this film
<START> i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate and the disgusting acting the acting in fact is what i feel steals the show i didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie and i hope that i never have to see any of them again overall i recommend renting this movie if you can find it i can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash
<START> and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that br br there really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing br br what's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance br br the same with catherine zeta jones' character the whinny self centered movie star zeta jones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing it's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years br br in the end it is hard to understand what made zeta jones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
<START> marie dressler carries this depression era drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler polly moran team you'll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film it's also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from mgm leonard smith's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera and don't move it' school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen it's like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off the film doesn't even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production overall it's an unsatisfying mess with dressler frequently over emoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart
<START> spoiler included some would say br br this film is not possible to take seriously at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can't help laughing at it all try me for the sequence where stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or and this is really my favorite snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite yeah what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats i dunno but he sure gives reality a run for the money
<START> i'm not a fan of adam sandler in fact i don't think i've ever liked him in anything i've seen him in the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears there was adam sandler playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a motor scooter looking pitiful and lost typical sandler type loser character again i thought i almost gave up then and there but then as i stuck with this i actually discovered something i never knew before adam sandler can act he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie a lost and lonely figure whose entire family including the dog was killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9 11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better of course cheadle's alan johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties the two of them made a completely believable team and sandler in particular made charlie real working through his emotions and feelings this is not a sandler comedy if your looking for that go to some of his other sillier stuff this is a pretty heavy movie sometimes sad sometimes hopeful and always engrossing there are some funny parts in it i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college and then the conversation the two of them have afterward br br i personally didn't think that saffron burrows added much to the movie as donna an obviously needy patient of johnson's the only reason for the character seemed based on one flashback to be that she looked eerily like charlie's late wife but that was never really developed and i just didn't care that much for the character do look for the part of the judge however played by donald sutherland who i thought nailed the part bang on as far as i'm concerned though this is sandler's movie and kudos to him for a great performance definitely his best in my opinion 8 10
<START> br br have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps tabs on every move you make well just remember before you decide to break the law the fbi will always be there at least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama the fbi story it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world in 1959 by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents chip hardesty james stewart br br chip was with the fbi from day one and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world even occasionally his family the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots go undercover to solve an indian murder estate scandal bring fugitives into custody rescue hostages and helped fight in wwii he even helped bring communist spies to justice br br stewart in a vaguely complex performance is stellar as always as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip's family life and his job we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son we also observe his wife having a miscarriage and his marriage having rocky times almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job vera miles gives a spotty performance but it's very convincing none the less she was never a brilliant actress but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her well maybe that's just me sadly none of the other performances are worth mentioning but the attention grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested br br the cinematography of this film was impressive especially the scenes in the south american jungles the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy's fabulous direction every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story it's chock full of ingenious camera shots some with a very hitchcockian feel br br all in all the fbi story is a spectacular but overlooked film clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance and the captivating story
<START> there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best br br the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system br br they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that's where the moral comes in it's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lot's of it thus enabling them to continue their struggle br br this film hit's the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out it's pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing
<START> i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that i didn't this movie has a very hard time following and or staying to a plot if someone tells you it's a comedy don't be fooled it's about 98 percent odd drama and 2 comedy all actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what this had potential and instead it was really a flop i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time save your money and see something else
<START> i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety was there actually a point to the film and the ending well im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film br br im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life if so was it an attempt to kick start her career if so im afraid it must have failed br br i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world if only i had had the same advice
