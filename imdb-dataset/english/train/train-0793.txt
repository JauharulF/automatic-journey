<START> there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe br br journalism 101 tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein's demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the us have declared marshall law i'm sure the papers here would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force br br aside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming so and so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writer producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldn't roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearing br br this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists which are by and large unthinking herds br br anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think
<START> for the first time in years i've felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review because it was just such a let down to watch the plot sounded awesome when i read it i expected a minimal mystery thriller a claustrophobic phantom hunt unfortunately it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth gnashingly stupid no one says things like this except in bad movies dialogs that it's just agonizing br br here's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film br br the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable no actually it's angering and lazy br br related to that cheap thrills a long parade just in time moments br br the main characters alright it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies thus his characters are boring lifeless second generation clichÃ©s they are mere plot devices place holders without the slightest bit of personality they are man and woman in break up who still love each other never seen that one before except in 100 000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable think of the blandest two dimensional hollywood fare and you've got it there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh charming or interesting br br the far fetched vague resolution that's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple though the word resolution might be ill fitting here because the movie is a swampy mess that isn't going anywhere anyway by the time you're through though you don't care anymore the last third of the movie i just fast forwarded because it was just so unbearable to watch br br okay that's it whatever redeeming features this movie has it all gets buried under incompetence don't watch this turd
<START> i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sour br br the story a u s soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u s has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesn't have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company the family comes to love him and vice versa the soldier also becomes in love with the family's daughter the woman that sent the christmas card there's only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that she's in love with it's also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the woman's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what's best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now she's so confused she's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but she's become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesn't know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesn't sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what he's done and doesn't want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the dad's urging him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasn't left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he broken hearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together br br things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film he's basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br things i don't like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language br br conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i don't recommend this film to anyone
<START> spoiler alert br br i had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks though i did like the extended version i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd br br the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length it was too long and dragged the movie along though the dancing is great would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene br br all in all this is a great movie my 5 year old liked it and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation this and mary poppins are added to my collection br br just as i had remembered br br out of br br
<START> i have a high tolerance for the weird but frankly some movies go way way beyond weird so far that they make your brain hurt this is such a film trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking drugs it's that incomprehensible br br the film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat however out of the blue tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur making me wonder if i am losing something in the translation however even if this is so why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever defecation puking lighting animals on fire etc all this really seemed random and pretty awful oddly and i don't know why some see this as a work of genius i just don't get that
<START> this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore br br taking no political sides this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about the by products of economical growth the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser developed communities the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles br br amazing heart breaking impossible to ignore this is a challenging journey but one worth taking please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues 10 10 definitely
<START> this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad acting bad plot bad casting bad directing bad cinematography if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn't have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood don't waste your time
<START> the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlin's character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that i'd like to believe that it is an insomnia cured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleep br br keep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
<START> bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesn't get any better than this zadora's over acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such don't miss ray liotta's debut film line looks like a penis
<START> sorry but aside from kim basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers i've seen in awhile logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard yet no one seems to notice then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit i can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs carrying a red toolbox screaming for god to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well
<START> 0 's christian slater tara reid stephen dorff frank c turner mathew walker will sanderson directed by uwe boll br br based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic relativity of what's going on in the dark and the light the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the feedings were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating 0 10
<START> i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this i was sure the incredible melting man would be a lot of fun br br it really wasn't i mean the acting was entertainingly bad the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor so i should have loved it unfortunately it's really draggy between these highlights i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return that's how boring this film is br br nevertheless if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr ted to be fair to the poor man he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man br br i'll find him with a geiger counter is he radioactive just a little bit br br yes the plot has dr ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini dyson he's a brave man unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree oh god it's his ear says dr ted to the audience i'm so glad he cleared that up br br i realise i'm making this movie sound rather fun it would be if it were only 10 minutes long but unfortunately it goes on and on and the incredible melting dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion i think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it just don't have pop tarts during the movie because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end
<START> i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide and even though this was his only film he is what made the movie so great at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide then i found out due to the current webpage at www imdb com he was born in 1957 in dayton ohio simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses he did a good acting job who can disagree i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered and that high schools do not have bath tubs i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films the reason s for his suicide are a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high he looked like a teenager i give this film two thumbs up the best horror film made probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business jacob young
<START> marjorie a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates pat and terry one night she gets in her car and is attacked by masked man with a knife his plan is to rape her but she manages to escape the man has her purse the police can't help her since the actual rape didn't happen then one day when marjorie's roommates are at work her assailant comes there his name is joe a long battle begins against this man but then she manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent stuff that will kill him if he won't get help soon she ties him up and makes joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental assaults he used on her earlier the extremities 1986 is directed by robert m young it's based on the controversial off broadway play from 1982 by william mastrosimone farrah fawcett who sadly lost her battle with cancer last year is terrific as marjorie james russo who played the attacker also in the play is convincing as joe alfre woodard and diana scarwid are great as pat and terry james avery is seen as security guard she got a golden globe nomination this is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you it asks a question is revenge justified this is not a perfect movie but i recommend it
<START> i was eager to see mr fix it because i'm a huge david boreanaz fan what i got though was a 1 1 2 hour nap the premise seemed enjoyable boreanaz is lance valenteen proprietor of a business called mr fix it where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back br br among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting although i've found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that crow movie he did this was disappointing at times his character was interesting and others flat the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasn't a big budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right br br my advice watch at your own risk
<START> in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be corrupted by bad language close proximity to thousands of men and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director jafar panahi's offside follows six girls disguised as men who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between iran and bahrain a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup in a departure from the bleak minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran br br shot with a digital camera using non professional actors who are more than up to the task the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium they are guarded by three young army conscripts safdar samandar mohammed kheir abadi and masoud kheymeh kaboud who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules the women are soccer enthusiasts not political activists and cheer for iran's victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future br br outspoken rather than acting like victims they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions making their absurdity quite obvious although they can hear the crowd noise the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female prisoner is escorted to the men's room by a soldier the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside br br little by little to paraphrase adlai stevenson that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century
<START> set in south africa a young black guy tries to land a part in a 'gangsta' movie but with no knowledge of street life he's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part he manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted but for the gang's leader the burgeoning disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own br br while that may sound relatively interesting it's anything but the first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious while the hijacking only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases in those chases only two police cars are used both of which are early 90's nissan sunny's not only would these be rather cheap to pick up and i find it rather hard to believe they'd be using such mundane old cars in south africa in the year 2000 but as far as i can remember there's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once the car chases are very badly shot with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads and they're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting this now leads me onto the characters and the acting which are equally bad the aforementioned kid who drives the car looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police everybody else is equally unconvincing so much that they even look bored at times themselves br br at the closing scene of the movie our main character sox moraka is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park while having trouble opening it the police arrive and ask him what he's doing and he replies by telling him it's their car after a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car after he's in the police return fire and in turn he gets wounded after another pathetic chase sequence they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence what follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects i've ever seen when the car explodes superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time it's so badly done and so phony looking that it's hard to even put it into words and really needs to be seen to be believed if you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier i've seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries the car is a volkswagen golf mk2 gti something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion i'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was it feels so cheap that i'm surprised it made it outside of south africa and even more surprised it made it to a dvd release br br i know it's not a big budget hollywood production i know it's meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of south africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market but with the laughable effects poorly executed car chases awful acting and ludicrous characters any sense of reality is completely lost br br overall i most certainly do not advise you to watch this if you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done low budget messes of amovie ever created then i'd recommend it for that and only that br br it is a wretched poorly made poorly edited poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts i've seen many south african movies including lots of cheap nuimage nu world action pictures and despite their cheesiness they're far better than this on all counts
<START> i am not one of those who think king is a great writer his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought br br this film suffers from being a pretty exact re telling of king's story if you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters this is a film made by king fans for king fans br br for the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a 'gypsy curse' horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner the final third has some severe structural problems and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little br br there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here br br
<START> i've been a jennifer connelly fan since phenomena and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven i saw it as soon as i could the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie
<START> i first saw breaking glass when it was released in england in 1980 i loved it then and having just caught it in august 2005 on a canadian station it still is great the only thing i regret is i can't find the sound track or the dvd in the stores anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time hazel kate had something to say about 80's britain actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being thatcher and what she was doing to the country at the time please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry
