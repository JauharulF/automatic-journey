<START> the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price i expected a based on the true story movie only to find a shot on home video hodge podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non related slaughter house scenes the video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but low and behold it only got worse if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one
<START> this is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home old and wise golden retriever shadow young american bulldog chance and himalayan cat sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family homeward bound the incredible journey 1993 is a family adventure directed by duwayne dunham it's a remake of a 1963 film this movie got a sequel three years later michael j fox is the perfect man to do the voice over for chance fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role sally field does great voice work as sassy don ameche is fantastic as shadow this was this veteran actor's second last movie also the visible actors are great kim greist plays laura burnford seaver robert hays is bob seaver benji thall plays peter burnford veronica lauren is hope burnford kevin chevalia is jamie seaver jean smart portrays kate it's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness we see sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner the bear scene is exiting and funny chance has no chance with that big hungry bear and his meeting with the porcupine looks painful this is some great fun for the whole family
<START> it's been said several times not least by me that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesn't deny it but then how could he he just resents it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch allah is set so far back in time that it's like watching woad dry those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea reality is not high on rohmer's agenda so that in 5th century france we have at one extreme a chÃ¢teau that would not be out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say 'come back godard all is forgiven' but even this woeful production can't make me utter those words
<START> this engaging which it shouldn't be low grade spanish exploitation quite tame i might add looks good but huh let me phrase that again 'huh ' actually the word 'huh ' would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too i just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle but there's no denying how laconically uneventful strange and wordy it feels br br unrelated sequences tied like that nasty opening involving a little girl dead cat and fire in to a sparse story involving photographer mario played by a chest puffing john caffari who's mustache is a dead ringer for nintendo's iconic mario what's the odds that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady a gorgeously fixating patty shepard who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches br br look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages but for most part seems sporadically non existent and unfocused just like his writing ramon sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on fernando garcia morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created the leads are capable but there's also a sturdy bunch the pick being vÃ­ctor israel of secondary performances br br slow with little in the way of interest but this dreamy set up that seems to go on and on manages to keep you watching until its closing
<START> i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull i don't think they were watching the right movie this isn't the prototypical action movie thank god br br this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people in this way it works extremely well with terrific performances from berenger and zane who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles he actually looks like he's acting br br i was disappointed with the action towards the end a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie but watch zane's face as he panics alone while berenger does the dirty work
<START> i love this show and my 11 year old daughter and i love watching it together it teaches good old fashioned values in a fun adventuresome and entertaining way albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time it's also really fun to make fun of you know rewind and insert your own dialog in place of the actors' br br i have my dvr set to record all the episodes and i happened to catch the tail end of an episode just prior to the next one starting so i don't know what episode it was but there was an absolutely terrible sequencing mistake adam had handed sheriff coffee a small swatch of leather which was torn from some outlaw's coat as he tried to make his getaway i suppose br br well roy happened to have the coat so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from the swatch was exactly rectangular which i reckon would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather post 1950's naugahyde yes leather i don't think so well the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved br br not 10 seconds later in the scene we see the coat again still lying on roy's desk but this time the swatch is more like the shape of north carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat and the seam which was smack dab in the middle of the swatch is now gone as is the seam in the coat my daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again it's prime for youtube i tell ya br br we still totally love the show though and the sequencing errors make it lots of fun
<START> wow some movies just leave me speechless this was undeniably one of those movies when i left the theatre not a single word came to my mouth all i had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half unfortunately it didn't work honestly this movie has nothing to recommend the humor was at the first grade level at best the acting was overly silly and the plot was astronomically far fetched i hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring chris kattan or any other cast member of snl
<START> this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace' no script since it was apparently written and added to daily no attention to camera or shots in mind poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101 how this pile got through no one can tell it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries this movie has one good part its end this film is my 1 worst film of all time finally howard the duck is no longer the goose
<START> beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish
<START> as a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic my post post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography stained glass ceramics metal forging welding and art drawing that also included silk screening br br i also keep healthy with jogging walking and lately hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah arizona and nevada jogging walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds br br within that background i was obsessed with rivers and tides i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of director cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer br br wonderful wonderful wonderful
<START> fabulous film rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson dorothy malone oscar winner robert stack oscar nominated and lauren bacall that words cannot describe paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone's murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct what a great joke br br by turns the film is hilarious riveting campy biting trashy compelling and eye rolling it's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big and little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you'll see here the camera work is smooth and polished the use of color is breathtaking the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable the one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut br br while most older highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it's actually a shame when it ends thank you to mr sirk for crafting and todd haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time see this movie
<START> scary movie 3 2003 was a bad idea to begin with the last film was a mediocre effort put it next to this load it's a comedy classic whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots at least it was funny there's nothing funny about forced humor jokes pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool the humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything when they catered to the junior high school crowd any sense of self respect was tossed out the window ring parodies are not funny i have watched them in comedies since 1998 they're so dated michael jackson jokes are not cool either what's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been performers whose best days were never br br the death of american cinema has been a slow one films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it's coffin whatever happened to real humor i haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time too many bad movies rot the brain you want proof go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves this movie is bad don't believe the hype i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again br br definitely not recommended unless you have a handful of brain cells
<START> forget depth of meaning leave your logic at the door and have a great time with this maniacally funny totally absurdist ultra campy live action cartoon mystery men is a send up of every superhero flick you've ever seen but its unlikely super wannabes are so interesting varied and well cast that they are memorable characters in their own right dark humor downright silliness bona fide action and even a touching moment or two combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner the comedic talents of the actors playing the mystery men including one mystery woman are a perfect foil for wes studi as what can only be described as a bargain basement yoda and geoffrey rush as one of the most off the wall and bizarrely charming villains ever to walk off the pages of a dark horse comic book and onto the big screen get ready to laugh cheer and say huh more than once enjoy
<START> john holmes is so famous he's infamous as the three amigos would say this is a rashomon like story about the events surrounding the wonderland murders of the early 1980's in los angeles the story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants there is story from the friend's perspective namely david lind played by dylan mcdermott he is a participant in the robbery assault at eddie nash's place eddie nash is a infamous drug dealer and is the suppose to be the same character alfred molina played in boogie nights and is heavily into the drug scene there is john holmes' perspective played by val kilmer which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings with a severe case of cocaine cravings there is also the patchwork recollections of john's wife sharon played by lisa kudrow and his girlfriend dawn played by kate bosworth that fill in the spaces between the two stories it is basically the same time frame that we are looking at just each character's version the only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people br br paul thomas anderson's boogie nights portrays john holmes as a slightly heroic character with a tragic yet comedic karma he is a caricature of a real person he was more of less a mixed up kid that got what he got through his large endowment director james cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in john's life into a nightmare for all of us watching the details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie br br val kilmer took what he learned of jim morrison from the doors enhanced the performance for the salton sea and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of john holmes through cocaine all of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal's of cocaine junkies josh lucas' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie he plays ron launius i think this character is suppose to be the same as the thomas jane character from boogie nights ron was the leader of the gang loved having john holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood the cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think did they really use splenda br br where boogie nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it lots of color and 70's nostalgia wonderland is dark the action is fast and furious with a lot of jumps it is twitchy and grainy there is no comedy just a never ending pace as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous fast paced edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling this is a graphic movie it has one of the most intensely violent scenes i have ever seen in a movie it actually shows the murders themselves through the eyes of john holmes at first and then from a third person perspective it is so graphic it looks like police evidence of a crime i had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie this movie is definitely not recommended for everyone i recommend it as a good alternative to boogie nights for those interested in the other sides of john holmes br br celluloid rehab
<START> this film is absolutely stunning a new blade runner future noir at it's most gritty the vision of paris is superb both recognisable and visionary with sweeping vistas grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality br br the story line is quite simple with few surprises but that's not what i like most about the film it is a visual treat br br done in 3d and rendered in black and white no greys with only one short spot of colour it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds there are many arty camera shots closeups and odd viewpoints but that just adds to the temperament of the film overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form br br i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions but unlike a scanner darkly which suffers from or indeed is enhanced by inconsistent character definition just watch the way some of the hair changes shape renaissance is consistent and precise throughout when the character is in close up added details and texture can bee seen but when in mid shot or further away details are omitted but not to the detriment of character definition br br for me the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one off project such a shame as i would like to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline and especially in this cutting edge graphic style br br oh and the english dub is great too br br all in all a great film and highly recommended
<START> watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago and now that i've found it again it still has a film experience like few others if risky it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids while it still holds up as an adult i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago trying to find it today is hard enough but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata's filmography with impressive art work and unique designs chirin no suzu represents a worthwhile experience while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english the musical score is nevertheless captivating but even the voice acting is far better than much released today unfortunately is went out of print in the mid 1980s from rca columbia home video and has not received any new format release to my knowledge at least in the us look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied it's an artful intense enjoyable and important landmark in japanese animation
<START> re pro jury br br although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story br br one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year old's they barely know but i doubt it br br easily give away virginity what a shrewd remark about this film truly br br one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world br br you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes that's sad br br one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake but i think not br br and another expert opinion drawn from experience dandy br br one may believe that 30 something year old troublemakers can enter into and hang around inside a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this br br now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up br br one final nit throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome but because it was never detailed each reference distracts from each scene br br of course there's probably an explanation good job figuring that out now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery although it was translated as a general foursome the word 269 etvorka has another meaning it's a sports term used to designate a 4m or 4w setup a rowing crew consisting of 5 persons 4 rowers and a coxswain br br this movie did not ring true for me br br we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion dude
<START> i just thought it was excellent and i still do i'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with saving grace is smart and enjoyable those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america's bride sort of movie br br saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband's debts br br in a nutshell a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing you couldn't ask for more br br 7 10
<START> it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april 1992 and the enchanted cottage 1945 both movies used wonderful actors not stars in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic performances br br enchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic
<START> to be honest i had to go see this movie backwards didn't expect that much but hey i was not deceived i had a good time br br i would say this movie is way a fresh breeze despite some facts that they tried to modernize nancy drew but this made me remember these youth movies of the 60 70s from europe and quebec where they manage to have children getting interacting with adults in this case a 16 year old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of an actress who died 25 years ago anyway as her dad had business in hollywood why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors well at least emma roberts does a great job here kinda like the chubby kid who at first is naively brought to support his sister's pranks to nancy but at the end found nancy quite cool enough to stick with her even with her matters br br rest of the supporting cast is great and was happy to see rachael leigh cook in a different role this time a single mother she did it in family rescue but this time she plays a mature woman anyway don't dump this it is fun
