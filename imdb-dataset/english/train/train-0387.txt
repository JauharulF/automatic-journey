<START> despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad documentary i must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative that said after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands br br one suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us or those we know are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping br br the film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and unlike the musical offers no cautionary clues or explanations only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight br br this soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable all the more remarkable act ii is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely setting the sad inmates' plight to music raises the human tragedy to art even more important this act is preceded by a fine act i where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about in short everything which the film is lacking br br to the filmmakers' credit or their successors the excellent criterion dvd release includes out takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film behind the scenes photographs interviews and commentary filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression they can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible br br ultimately though it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer doug wright composer scott frankel and lyricist michael korie which raises the rating of the original grey gardens above a single generous star
<START> hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn't without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can't use this word forever but i can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn't rank along the best 7 5 10 bethany cox
<START> was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of ed norton's facial hair without revealing any plot details on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place it was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard later on in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven this was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option these continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had also i found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of de niro in taxi driver even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer
<START> the author of nekromantik jÃ¶rg buttgereit's second feature film der todesking is a powerful masterpiece centered around a chain letter originating from a group called the brotherhood of the 7th day the movie shows 7 episodes each consisting of one day during one week where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it's rounds do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals enjoy happy or even remotely normal movies or expect a movie to be good only if it is focused on stage acting br br the nihilistic avant garde approach of der todesking well explains why buttgereit's movies in general were banned in germany their native country of origin during the 80's and most of the 90's der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on screen but the meaningless apathy or depression most people's lives consist of in general buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living only reasons to stop and in choosing how and when you die you can also be the king of death der todesking br br buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies art film would probably be the closest description every time der todesking features an original method to shoot create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene during one scene the camera slowly continuously pans in 360 degree circle while a person lives in a small one room apartment for a day during another buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man while he dwells in his desperation during a third seemingly pleasant scene names ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on screen supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movie br br episode movies and especially this one as the scenes are only vaguely connected generally suffer from incoherence and der todesking is no exception while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it's consequences or subsequences in all it's variations there are very powerful episodes yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material partly draining the overall power of the movie still the the jaw dropping immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it's more vague moments back to the status of greatness the general atmosphere is baffling awe inspiring highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of br br this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans this is a small different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience whether it be confusion amazement or even hate you aren't likely to be left cold by this in my opinion the best achievement of this small indie crew br br the main theme of the movie die fahrt ins reich der menschentrÃ¼mmer part i iii was released in a limited 666 piece 8 vinyl edition which is now much sought after you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting the nekromantik soundtrack cd which i highly recommend the lo fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky almost illbient like makes an essential part of the movie's atmosphere and is something you would very very rarely hear otherwise much recommended
<START> this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didn't even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too when he stuck the needle up ma wu's butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the 90s
<START> the movie is very realistic absolutely it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts their everyday life adventures overall the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent not everything happens the way we think it should happen i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note we watch we learn we experience ourselves that is probably the moral of this story
<START> i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get go when miss stanwyck starts her narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it here it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really stressful even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award
<START> this movie is one of those wow movies not because it's the greatest movie of all time but because it surprised me not only was it a t v movie but it was on elvis i can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one elvis but i can also safely say that kurt russel came extremely close to being the real thing it was one of the greatest impersonations that i have ever seen he had me believing that it was really him i learned a lot about elvis' life from watching this movie and don't led the television part of it let you stray it's actually a really fantastic film and kurt russel could've been elvis' twin
<START> hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no thought required there are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies a pretty good cast with donald sutherland john lithgow and the lovely tia carrere this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one on a scale of one to ten a 4
<START> had this film been put together a tad better it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers as it is it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot i e randolph scott romancing rogers' sister played by harriet hilliard that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers br br astaire and scott are two navy men scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend a blond but unmistakable lucille ball to glamor her up meanwhile astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off the result is some wonderful dance numbers with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately i'm putting all my eggs in one basket let yourself go and i'd rather lead the band hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl although she sings her two songs well but where are you and get thee behind me satan one poster didn't care for that song but i love the title rogers is vivacious and a youthful astaire is a dynamo br br the highlight of the movie comes at the end with let's face the music and dance one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire in it they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again
<START> typical 90's comedy situational comedy similar to our modern day my family thatcher being the height of most political jokes bill belinda lang blames thatcher for anything she can bloody thatcher possibly shared with most of us david the typical teenager cutting up brains with bread knives jenny the moody older teenage child only interested in boys and more boys bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family afloat struggling within the economical climate of the early 90's granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however series 3 onwards is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count overall this show didn't get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer clearly they couldn't have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of catherine tate the office little britain and bring back the classics
<START> on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer becky julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future mother in law calls him and informs that his fiancÃ©e karen selma blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and selma blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seven br br title brazil louco por elas crazy for them
<START> although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars frank sinatra gene kelly kathryn grayson and director george sidney a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at and in conjunction the line up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws br br sinatra and kelly are clarence doolittle and joseph brady respectively two navy men as the film begins they're just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears appropriately enough and seeks advice on women from brady in private publicly scriptwriter isobel lennart and sidney have all of the navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other brady promises to help get doolittle hooked up but primarily because doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise a kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy he won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives brady helps and he and doolittle end up taking the boy back home when the boy's guardian susan abbott grayson finally shows up doolittle goes gaga for her brady tries to convince him to forget about her brady just wants to get back to lola but they keep getting coaxed back to abbott's home and eventually something of a love triangle forms things become more complicated when brady lies about doolittle knowing a famous musician jose iturbi who is in residence at a film studio and claims that doolittle has set up an audition for abbott who is a singer and actress in front of iturbi br br because of the story the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the navy premise obviously broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings opera what abbott's character excels at liberace like popular classical what iturbi did and mexican music because abbott frequents a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l a the combination doesn't work as well as it could plenty of the songs are good and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence worse there are a couple showcases for iturbi who was apparently a big star at the time that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music robert altman's kansas city 1996 but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film anchors aweigh takes a similar tactic yes this is a musical but there's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material br br there are also some plot problems it's not very well established why brady is so against doolittle's pursuit of abbott we can guess that brady thinks doolittle shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid and who seems relatively proper and traditional but on the other hand brady can tell that doolittle doesn't have the same womanizing disposition that brady admits of himself abbott seems like a good fit for doolittle and furthermore lennart works hard to establish that brady just wants to get doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting lola it seems that brady's character should be quickly pawning doolittle off on any candidate whether she's a good fit or not this might seem like a minor detail but it's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot the story also seems a bit drawn out length is a problem anchors aweigh clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes should have been cut down by at least a half hour br br the above surely sounds like i'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8 i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws br br sinatra kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic separately and together they turn in good interesting performances sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29 Â 30 while shooting he plays an unusually naÃ¯ve virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later and different than his public image as a crooner for kelly this was his breakthrough film and rightfully so his choreography is varied and impressive as is his acting grayson is charming her performance is sophisticatedly understated and she's simply gorgeous all of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing br br and there's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame in an extended fantasy sequence this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson where brady is imagining abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony br br as uneven and flawed as the film is it is largely successful and entertaining to watch fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss anchors aweigh and neither should sinatra fans who'll get quite a kick out of his character
<START> truly awful film made by cinematographer turned director ted tetzlaff decent enough looking film but for a time bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk there are some details thrown around canadian ex army or raf defused bombs in the war his wife is leaving him but none of these back stories add up to much the bomber himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or postwar i assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more salient generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good time bomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger uxb for a more exciting time at about the same running time
<START> do not waste your time watching this unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good film i am not one to usually review a movie but this one is personal i wasted precious time which they cannot give back i feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap if this was a student project i would have to say not bad but only for the first 15 min after that it gets annoying the screaming the bad audio the bad video a good camera man could have made it much better and yes whats with the blair witch effect no budget i was hoping it was going to get better but it doesn't now how the hell did it deserves a 4 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time i have said my peace
<START> after her oscar nominated turn in secrets lies brenda blethyn starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day br br after her husband commits suicide grace trevethyn brenda blethyn discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana that's right grace starts cultivating it br br every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn't see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances but of course there's a lot more to it than that
<START> i'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful despite several good performances and generally competent acting for the camera direction it's a first and last attempt by writer director soo lyu rub and tug 2002 is one of the unfortunate by products of canada's program to promote home grown film making while the program encourages worthwhile efforts like new waterford girl it opens the door for untalented novices like lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials br br you don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design bad lighting poor audio and dreary docu style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter the workers in canadian massage parlors but the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with the editor much to assemble or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief when your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique even though nothing happens the movie is hard to follow and point of view impossible to pin down br br don mckellar's performance as conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in exotica lindy booth's lea is her standard quirky airhead as always she is likable but here she is little else kira clavell's cindy is a pleasant surprise a kind of asian shelley duval the only other role of any consequence tara spencer nairn's street wise betty more than cancels out her excellent performance in new waterford girl her shallow performance in rub and tug should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared unless you need further confirmation of waterford director alan moyle's skill in working with young actors br br you quickly conclude that lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity so the need to insert a lazy and lame deus ex machina device toward the end is hardly a surprise still it could be worse the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say is what did i just watch and i mean that in a good and bad way br br the plot is really simple stiller and black play friends neighbors stiller is the focused hardworker while black is a dreamer black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo the idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich the extravagant lifestyle that black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with stiller causes stiller to become crazy with envy br br as i said the plot is simple everything else is plain odd the direction is odd with a weird rotating opening shot to out of nowhere sped up sequences the dialouge and the acting is very odd odd in a rambling sort of way and the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie from the weird envy song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in japanese br br so the true question is this is odd funny that depends purely on the individual i was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie after the screening i heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free strangely i understood their point there are no jokes whatsoever so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all you will hate this movie absolutely hate it br br this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a dvd cult classic if you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes like cable guy or punch drunk love then i suggest you see it if you don't run away from this movie it'll only make you mad
<START> this is a review of the wizard not to be confused with the wiz or mr wizard the wizard is a late eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz and mr wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it br br now that we've gotten all that out of the way let me say this there's really no reason to see this movie it's simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3 i use the word designed in the loosest sense possible because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos br br i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you it sure hasn't been for me in fact i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it next time you're at the video store and you see the the wiz the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead
<START> i enjoyed it in general i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi i'm also partial to sci fi fantasy and the dinosaur craze i read for pleasure but when i'm feeling over stressed or really mind dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex enabled me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesn't really matter to me and no i'm not a juvenile nor am i a moron
