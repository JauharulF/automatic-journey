<START> i saw this movie in new york city i was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 in the morning it was raining and did not want to wait at the port authorty so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life it was so bad that i chose to stay and see the whole movie i have yet to see anything else that bad since the year was 69 so call me crazy i stayed only because i could not belive it
<START> there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public seen today some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda which they technically are but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre having a pretty realistic script and good production values pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films you know the tough talking hard driven but swell guy randolph scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews the film is well crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far fetched that it perhaps except for the very end where the film is a bit over the top but also very satisfying about the only serious negative and this is mostly for nitpickers is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this all others probably won't notice
<START> this is ostensibly a movie about multiple grief as such it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters however its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible the camera continually switches from one scene to another from one personal crisis to the next creating a choppy disjointed effect most characters appear to live aimless unstructured lives held together by their professional commitments it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met the storyline if there is a storyline is difficult to follow in sum the overall effect is rather disappointing in spite of all that the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful
<START> an innocent man steve guttenberg has a one night stand with his boss's wife isabelle huppert she spots a woman elizabeth mcgovern being attacked outside but she can't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg's boss paul shenar so guttenberg honest citizen that he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert well never bear false witness against thy neighbor as they say br br this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted when he meets the first near victim mcgovern she immediately twigs to what happened but agrees to keep quiet for the moment but then guttenberg finds himself in court supposed to identify the heavy greenquist and we discover through cross examination that he is near sighted and can't identify objects at a distance let alone faces not that it matters because after all he never saw the creep in the first place the plot gets practically labyrinthine guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too br br he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now sympathetic mcgovern guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer she will serve as bait they'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to just to get him to try to kill her but everything will be okay see because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive but she will keep a can of mace handy just in case br br i ask you the alert viewer does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times but she's vibrant steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that's about it otherwise he's as helpless as the character he plays if isabelle huppert can act it isn't evident in this film the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs br br didn't the director curtis hanson go on to make l a confidential that was a nicely done piece of work here everything seems clumsy and contrived down to the small bit parts just before the inevitable violent climax a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern's rescue and the scene is embarrassing to watch dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper he's a neat guy and always reliable paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too br br that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes was shot at a bar in carolina beach in north carolina not far from where i lived the way the interior is set up it's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality br br overall this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story
<START> i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it but this movie was terrible i have yet to see why people thought it was funny the idea behind it is stupid plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me
<START> this movie does not rock as others have said i found it really boring and silly the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer the singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on halloween which would actually make it november 1st a much less potent date to be sure the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back play messages it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world br br the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special we see the metal kid the outsider tormented over and over by the popular kids and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party don't go it is a trap especially if it is a pool party anybody surprised when he ends up in the water it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson br br so back to the horror part of the film so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys which would have made much more sense he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm what a sensitive hero what fun is that in a horror movie thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him if it were me i would have put that music on and pronto br br the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized why not partner with him and really do some damage why you ask it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt more appropriate for a molly ringwald film is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast the movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss
<START> great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often slow movie enjoyable at times it had me checking my watch although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line
<START> attack of the killer tomatoes consists mostly of rambling poorly assembled footage in search of a movie the plot makes no sense and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all watching this silly spoof you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately that it's easy to make a cheap low quality film and then use the parody angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality in one scene female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them how far can suspension of disbelief go even in a parody the title song is great though 1 2
<START> near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael corleone's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael corleone does not want this but his estranged ex wife kay manages to convince him to let anthony corleone pursue music as he wishes so he does br br that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here you'll see where i'm going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud so of course michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semi incestuous affair with michael's daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part ii br br it is like a soap opera one horrid awful 169 minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a 16 year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the 1970's br br what's worse the godfather part iii isn't even a logical follow up of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasn't just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if it'd be no fun to watch he's become a goody goody that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for heaven's sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear she aborted his baby and his sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it didn't francis ford coppola even think of these things br br and don't even get me started on mary and vincent's affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging sofia coppola's acting did nothing to help she made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles in the climactic scene i won't go into detail but you'll know which scene i'm talking about when if you watch it she looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughter br br now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony corleone's musical ambitions after 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances anthony corleone returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about 10 15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killers they were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the corleone family's origin i'll bet it was one swell opera and i'll bet michael corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music br br my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony corleone's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama better yet i wish he hadn't made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was self indulgent and unnecessary br br p s this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all 3 godfather films over a month ago though i was rewatching the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii weren't screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means i've had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i ii and pretend like part iii never existed
<START> i love zombie movies and i love amateur productions and meat market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to fulciÂ´s classic zombi br br so i leaned back and waited to be impressed okay some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors the vampirelady and the cook really stand out but else thereÂ´s nothing br br i didnÂ´t expect a new romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value the director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits but now after two parts itÂ´s time to learn something more br br in meatmarket2 gore rhymes with bore for me thatÂ´s not enough sorry br br out of
<START> i just couldn't stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don't need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame the dinosaurs are the same rubber oh my i could see the stick that holds t rex head for a moment the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2 t rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but oopps to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel br br what can i say don't rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining
<START> i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped well we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol you see it's not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let's face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched br br give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldn't say that this movie was overhyped at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more br br personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let's face it the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job it's not thier best work i've seen much better work from both of them but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before give them a break br br
<START> ok who brought the cheese i love it during it's run it became a phenomenon the anorexic twins became popular bob saget started making a paycheck instead of his really funny stand up and people knew who dave coulier was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i differ from the norm i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare say it could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an 8 10 because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of bob saget
<START> brilliant film the next best film to the drunken master jackie chan i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film and many other old fashioned chinese kung fu movies great the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic i have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the 36th chamber is played by a different character it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu
<START> here's why the jane show won't work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people don't watch a lot of t v from the u s which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break here's a little advice for the writers of the show don't write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
<START> to say funky forest the first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions i can really get into a good art house film even a surreal and twisted romp like el topo naked lunch and survive style 5 because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll br br fffc attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual essentially there is no substance in this movie this movie is badly done the visuals in this movie are not inspiring the dialog is worse the musical numbers destroy this movie i chuckled for guitar brothers but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant it attempted to be deep and meaningful i think but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting br br guitar brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each everything else is just badly paced pseudo creative heavy handed attempts at being as good as films by other real directors like sogo ishii david lynch and jodoworsky give me a break i am convinced that people that rave about fffc are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes br br this movie was an extreme disappointment coming off the high that was survive style 5 a film that actually has meaning combined with excellent use of scenery cinematography catchy dialog funny moments good soundtrack excellent performances fantastic pacing and flow fffc features the exact opposite in every way boring scenery 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night a completely white stage alien balls floating in white space a dinky school hallway and then a school hallway terrible cinematography forgettable dialog nothing funny or humorous save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours soundtrack amateurish performances uneven disjointed and often flat out dragging pacing zero flow whatsoever br br there are those that claim this is what makes fffc a great movie that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius this is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems because unpredictable could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with boring innane and terrible personally i have spoken with two people who admitted to me that fffc was terrible when they left the theater but overwhelming rave by art house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a hey it was pretty good i liked it br br i'm going to put my foot down this movie is slop i don't care if roger ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity the emperor's new cloak i say this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic trippy films to come from japan in the last 10 years taste of tea party 7 and kamikaze girls are much better movies even with a low budget and none can honestly compare with survive style 5 watch fffc only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget
<START> hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red orange filter which makes everything very murky the martian landscape vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing there are echoes of 'bride of the monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci fi' music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time
<START> goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ of its time br br this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike you'll enjoy it br br unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very 'bond' able storyline you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie br br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is a stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it's still a good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it i've got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and well written storyline br br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome br br i've gotta go throw this game on now if you haven't played it yet you're missing out
<START> the killings in this movie isn't that bad but for sure the movie is it's even worse than that it's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd player br br not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd store not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it horrible br br it's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching add to that the group pressure from my co watchers br br the manuscript is awful the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable br br i hope you don't see this as a spoiling your fun i'd rather see it as a fair warning do not waste your time watching this garbage
<START> despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous it's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve o'clock high has very little action but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of g i joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fast paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turn off is pvt dondaro played by wally cassell who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert by contrast sgt warnicki is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when volunteering for another patrol every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step Â one patrol too many Â drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for meredith's portrayal of pyle it is practically comatose
