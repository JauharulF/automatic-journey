<START> the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time br br the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york and the impression i had of trying to be as american as possible which i think has absolutely failed br br the scenes in the back really got to my heart the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen in future i will watch more of her movies great luck for me that i am a native german speaking and only for a year in the us so as soon as i am back i'll buy some riemann dvds br br so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet watch it i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain but simply watcxh it you will be zesty
<START> i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving and gay relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave taking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
<START> i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piece by piece on tcm last night the question arises to me why did they do that putting their lives in jeopardy many of them died on the trek why would they undertake such a life endangering journey just to find food for their animals once they reached the land of milk and honey why didn't they just stay there would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i
<START> the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies but this just didn't qualify it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity which again isn't a bad plot but is done poorly here there are some scenes such as the ending which are not intended to be funny but actually made me laugh out loud there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction but it never fulfills what it could and should be in my opinion if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick try silent night deadly night
<START> encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i've seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it's awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline 'acting ' soundtrack the film's only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only
<START> this was a good movie it wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different this movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war this film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made colin farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and clifton collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well seeing colin farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years you would never thought it would happen i will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future
<START> i really wanted to like this movie the location shots were mostly filmed in pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography but even for a filmed cartoon it was a really badly made movie the continuity and pacing were both simply awful the best bits in the movie are under the ending credits so it's almost worth sticking it out to the end though oddly it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so br br when the best performance in a movie is by andy dick you know there's got to be a problem
<START> i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american servicemen and japanese women in post war japan as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them brando goes from having contempt for the japanese which is natural considering ww2 to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her his performance is okay i am not a major fan of his acting style and the movie is marvelous throughout red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another gi who falls in love in japan though the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job br br i don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of tissues br br this movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time a mostly underrated gem
<START> my personal favorite horror film from the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist this is carpenter's masterpiece br br halloween night 1963 little michael meyers murders his older sister all hallows eve 1978 michael escapes from smith's grove sanitarium halloween night michael has come home to murder again br br the story is perfectly simple michael stalks and kills babysitters no bells or whistles just the basics it's carpenter's almost over powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension like any great horror film events are telegraphed long in advance yet they still seem to occur at random never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film br br the dark lighting the long steady cam shots and most importantly that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes i have yet to see in film there is a body count but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small that and most of the murders are nearly bloodless the fear is not in death but in not knowing br br the acting is roundelay good pj soles provides much of the films limited humor and one of the best deaths nancy loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young at the time jamie leigh curtis her performance at first seems shy and un assured yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character who is herself shy and un assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face and of course there is the perfectly cast donald pleasence as the determined perhaps a little unstable dr sam loomis rest in peace mr pleasence br br if the film has a detrimental flaw it would be the passage of time since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones copies rip offs and imitators have come along and stolen usually badly the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites one finds much of the films raw power diluted to truly appreciate it in this day and age it must be viewed as it once was as something unique br br never the less i have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good scary time highest reguards br br 10 10
<START> i totally disagree i thought that this was a great movie for kids dawn wells from gilligans island and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be i wont ruin the ending but it was unusual the way that it was done i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially it also helps them out of a jam towards the end it also has the plus of not being overly long i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes
<START> begin spoiler fitfully funny and memorable for mr chong's literal roach smoking scene chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe's bowl lights up coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat re loads the bowl properly re lights re tokes end spoiler alas i began to lose faith less than half way through the proceedings it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners harold and kumar i simply prefer brighter company yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they the former are sober notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in pre pee wee form
<START> with the release of peter jackson's famed lord of the rings trilogy it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshi's 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior i agree with the majority that jackson's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkien's work but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi's ambitious pioneering effort jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations br br the film's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive but these points didn't bother me very much however the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie the only character representation i was bothered by was sam's he was made to look unbecomingly silly br br this film is novel for its animation techniques in addition to hand drawn characters live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping it is quite apparent which characters are hand drawn and which are rotoscoped but none the less i found that the film's style was a novelty the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well br br the voice acting was generally of high quality particularly good was john hurt who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn aragorn isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories but backed by john hurt's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation my other favorite was william squire whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam whose voice acting was irritating and added to sam's unfortunately silly image the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as aruman br br in producing this film ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films hence this film contains about half the story from the start of the fellowship of the ring to the end of the battle at helm's deep in the two towers the obvious implication of this is that the film's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations but the liberties taken to compress the story didn't bother me even the choice to leave arwen out of the story enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helm's deep were tremendous br br ralph bakshi's version of the lord of the rings isn't perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story however for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel
<START> this movie is not the same as the 1954 version with judy garland and james mason and that is a shame because the 1954 version is in my opinion much better i am not denying barbra streisand's talent at all she is a good actress and brilliant singer i am not acquainted with kris kristofferson's other work and therefore i can't pass judgment on it however this movie leaves much to be desired it is paced slowly it has gratuitous nudity and foul language and can be very difficult to sit through br br however i am not a big fan of rock music so it's only natural that i would like the judy garland version better see the 1976 film with barbra and kris and judge for yourself
<START> i had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as i did when i saw daniel day lewis play christy brown in my left foot in fact off the scene his role wasn't even over he played the role of christy brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back to me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role i believe it is quite true to say he put on the most oscar worthy performance in history he was so masterful in this tough a part that i believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him although i cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time i can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasn't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet i will ever seen an actor do probably a man too for that matter
<START> this horror movie based on the novel of the same name suffers from flawed production and choppy amateurish direction but it's nonetheless strangely compelling unlike shocker horror flicks such as the exorcist this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil it drifts into horror which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who's been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world this falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life br br the story is true to the book which was riveting but the way it's edited can lose the viewer there are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily which hurts this film that's a pity the sentinel is not an edge of your seat kind of flick it's more a watch and squirm uncomfortably like a bad car wreck there's a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable this movie isn't all bad and still has a capacity to shock br br the cast was competent christina raines was captivating as alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a pawn in the never ending battle between good and evil chris sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self centered boyfriend eli wallach and a very young christopher walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they've been handed ava gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property the gaunt elderly john carradine with his arthritis twisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced the devil is played to charming perfection by burgess meredith he's so sweet and yet so evil there are future stars hidden in this film beverly d'angelo and jeff goldblum as friends of the poor girl and jerry orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director the damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius br br the horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly such as when alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores she relives her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake time and again she's yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope in truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel will he succeed in summary slow moving yet indescribably creepy well acted but poorly directed and a very typical 70's horror film before the real shockers cut loose no pun intended this movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some low key shock value it remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil
<START> but how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win for george knox it is not easy as the movie opens roger beaumont joseph gordon levitt and his best friend j p milton davis jr are riding on thier bikes around the angels' stadium when they return to thier foster mother's home roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad dermot mulroney his mom is dead and when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes i say when the angels win the division championship so later on roger and j p hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball when the manger george knox danny glover take out his pitcher the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the fightm that gets knox ejected from the game that night roger makes a prayer for the angles win the championship when his foster mother maggie nelson brenda ficker agrees that roger and j p go to a basball roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder matthew mcconaughey makes a catch that leaves the manger and the play by play man jay o sanders how did he to that roger learns from the head angel christopher lloyd that only he can see the angles because he was the only that prayed for help br br 10 10
<START> because that's all she does through out this whole movie is get naked for no good reason when tarzan is bitten by a snake she suddenly removes her clothes since when is a boa constrictor poisonous how did tarzan get poisoned by the way this whole movie is screwed up they couldn't get the species of animals for this movie right whats an orangutang doing hanging around those chimpanzees he must have wandered off the set of a much better film the group of cannibal tribe's men look caucasin why and why was bo and her dad painted if they were going to be eaten later it was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again her dad while hunting approaches and acts stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it any real african bull elephant that wasn't from the circus would've stomped this moron's butt any smart hunter would've started shooting the minute he saw it and i can't help but wonder if the camera was on lsd because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion for no good reason it didn't make good sense at all the boa constrictor that tarzan wrestled with in the water looks like one of those 12 ft rubber snakes you can buy at a local spencer gifts tarzan was strangly speechless in this film maybe from bo flashing herself so much i'm sorry but this is a rip off of a classic black and white tarzan movie with a similar but better story not to mention plotting there's one scene in that i saw that everyone forgot to mention spoilers alert the scene where he is trying to rescue jane and her dad has him standing too close to a running water spout it made it seem like he's urinating on someone below him eww also him and jane are fooling around on a beach with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping she sure did take her dad's death real well end of spoilers there should be a surgeon general's warning on this film that seeing bo naked too much in this movie will make you go blind
<START> i dug this out and watched it tonight i honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time i saw it i remember it being a seriously flawed film i don't remember it being this bad br br i am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly who am i to blame for this the 2 guys who wrote and i use that word loosely the script the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story only 2 of them are among the amazing 5 the director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing bad acting everywhere i liked the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film don black who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music br br it figures that i should pull this out less than a week after re reading the comic book adaptation the first 15 20 minutes of the film more or less really less parallel the first issue of the comic as i watched it tonight i kept wondering why was almost every single detail changed doc showing up then using his wrist watch remote control to open the safe and the sniper's bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass were just about the only things left the same i mean if you're gonna do an adaptation why in god's name change everything br br once they leave doc's hq virtually nothing is as it was in the comic which given roy thomas i figure probably follows the book i read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie again why i've heard it was changed because they weren't able to secure the kind of budget they wanted i look at the film and think lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screen br br you know when people complain about joel schumacher they should really take a look at this thing the best thing i can say is i think it would make a great double feature with the 1966 batman feature and probably a great triple bill with that and the 1980 flash gordon all 3 films are silly maybe we can blame the 1966 film and tv series for this some fans have complained over the years that adam west's batman ruined the image of comic books in the minds of generations of non comics fans i think the same could be said for hollywood i'm reminded of how many really really bad films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late 70's early 80's charlie chan fu manchu tarzan buck rogers flash gordon the lone ranger all murdered by hollywood types who think oh comic books so you know it's supposed to be stupid more like they're the stupid ones what a waste of potential br br let me say some good things despite the script and the directing ron ely is great when i read a doc savage story i don't think of the james bama paintings i think of ely bill lucking who later was a regular on the a team is terrific eldon quick who i've seen somewhere else but can't recall where is terrific paul gleason who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film pamela hensley though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story is terrific before she let her hair down i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like ardala valmar from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips i just read the other day she's got a big nose like ardala only not quite as pronounced the comics ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura or cher or maybe streisand take yer pick ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips after she was stunning br br paul wexler funny enough i saw just last week in a get smart episode i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing i don't know because that character sure wasn't in the movie the film takes its title from
<START> actually had to stop it don't get me wrong love bad monster movies but this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts was way too obvious a clichÃ© this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting from the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but that's another review deep shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget
<START> i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman it is great when jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless then when he starts to address the priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the pee woman great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode i'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo
