<START> enjoyable and watchable tim meadows at his best a big boost from billy dee williams he and a very funny john witherspoon provide a solid foundation for mr meadows' riffing have fun with this one
<START> excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and dad br br dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage mom olympia dukakis has left him br br the rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad's thoughts off what has occurred with them away the daughters can play detectives br br the story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life what should have been why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of life br br we see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl both men seem to break out of their daily lives br br the end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity it's never too late to change
<START> this movie was strange i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis mushrooms it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but mushrooms weren't enough i couldn't stop laughing maybe lsd would work the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didn't think it was very interesting and i was on mushrooms at the time if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit pop it on you'll get a few laughs
<START> when this movie was released it spawned one of the all time great capsule movie reviews sphinx stinks it does but in a mesmerizing sort of way the casting is silly starting at the top frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians not enough makeup in cairo for that at least not while this film was being made but it's rather amusing to see them try the performances run the gamut from mummy like sorry the obvious observation to over the top with very few stops in between the lesley anne down character seems as though she couldn't find egypt on a map much less expound upon its archaeological treasures that's due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie it's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric such as egyptology are ripe for silly overwritten dialogue it doesn't disappoint and the convergence proves a double whammy the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension can this get dumber and less believable the answer is usually yes the location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low budget production that and the fact that there are so many well known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher cheap no cheesy yes
<START> impenetrable rubbish this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the horror effects are laughable the only thing that kept me watching was the ever splendid and totally underrated michael cule
<START> woman with wig who dyes her hair in the middle of the film takes of wig presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away br br begin spoiler alert that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of spoiler alert br br and what a spoiler that was the title already gives it away doesn't it bad acting bad script waste of time oh yeah in the end she lives happily ever after br br if you liked this movie you'll really love cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death
<START> i liked this film very much the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow there is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points
<START> what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches unctuous priests spitting before handshakes town square cattle marts cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches religous strife it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic fathered child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the '50's county wexford villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for belfast then scotland where a few more cliches are reguritated while she's there her father who looks eerily like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott which turns very nasty i'm not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because it's not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it in addition it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches in the past
<START> everybody knows that gregory widen's original the prophecy didn't really require a sequel but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable part two is a very prototypic example of a straight to video sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action more witty one liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental if it wasn't for walken's performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig the prophecy ii surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales jennifer beals from getting born for you see her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel's evil dominion thus just as in the first movie he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown the prophecy ii is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity whenever the storyline becomes too tedious the makers luckily enough always insert a near brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences on a slightly off topic note i often felt like the prophecy ii ambitions to look similar to terminator ii Â gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location where the final battle takes place looks very similar to the steel factory where terminator ii ended as well coincidence i guess overall this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of christopher walken's unique acting charisma and who isn't
<START> i didn't mind the film that much but it was incredibly dull and boring a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for br br you should give it a go if you like silly stupid humour because this is the film for you
<START> the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow but good there is also a pause button bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996 thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990 then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever this ex monty phyton man knows exactly how genius sf stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better there is the lunatic brad pitt his performance in the asylum is memorable and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzenegger wanna be it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated and yet you can follow that every view gives you other surprises one of my big favourites
<START> this movie was great and i would like to buy it the boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe the eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know i haven't seen it for over 30 years but still remember parts of the movie deniselacey2000 yahoo com
<START> malÃ©fique is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well executed plot and a lot of heart its cast doesn't have recognized names it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well written script an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills eric valette may not be a well know name yet but with malÃ©fique his feature length debut he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet gans or aja br br the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out carrÃ¨re gÃ©rald laroche gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi millionaire fraud his cell mates the violent marcus clovis cornillac the intellectual lassalle philippe laudenbach and the mentally challenged pÃ¢querette dimitri rataud are all convicted for murder and give carrÃ¨re a cold welcome their personalities will clash as carrÃ¨re discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic br br written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier malÃ©fique is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker's stories the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities the story's supernatural element is very well handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel despite being a movie about four men locked in a room the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust claustrophobia and specially paranoia br br director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere mood and his cast to give life to the plot despite its obvious lack of budget he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original fresh and very attractive his subtle and effective camera work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot the very few displays of special effects are very well done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore br br the characters are what make this film work and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit gÃ©rald laroche is excellent as carrÃ¨re a man at first sight innocent but who hides a dark past philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too specially rataud in his very demanding role however is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them br br the movie is terrific but it is not without its share of flaws of course the most notorious one is its the low budget some of the cgi effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make up and prosthetics used in other scenes however it is never too bad for it probably the bad thing about malÃ©fique is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view br br anyways malÃ©fique is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately and one that deserves to have more recognition valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest albeit complex tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities personally this film is a new favorite 8 10
<START> i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my 3 film i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film it's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like sÃ¥ som i himmelen this was a very good film and i'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well rounded cast i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9 0 on a scale of 10
<START> the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring it focused on the personal problems doyle had including his sick wife death threats by fans a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle's life i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes the last 40 minutes were excellent we finally got a look inside doyle head how he created holmes and why he had to 'kill' holmes the actors are excellent including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny arthur conan doyle a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox as the 'role model' for sherlock holmes dr bell the locations are good especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece
<START> this happens to be one of my favorite horror films it's a rich classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors beautiful on location cinematography a haunting musical score an intelligent and novel plot theme and an atmosphere of dread and menace it's reminiscent of such classic films as rosemary's baby and the shining wherein young vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old creepy buildings with a macabre past here cristina raines plays a top new york city fashion model named alison parker her happy outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul this is evidenced by the revelation that in her past she attempted suicide twice once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor and the second time after her married lawyer boyfriend's wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair telling her beau played by a suitably slimy chris sarandon that she needs to live on her own for a year or so she answers a newspaper ad for a fully furnished spacious one bedroom apartment in an old brooklyn heights brownstone this building actually exists and is located at 10 montague terrace right by the brooklyn heights promenade off remsen street the producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments paying the residents for their inconvenience of course the real estate agent a miss logan ava gardner seems to be very interested in having alison take the apartment an interest that cannot be solely explained by the 6 commission she would earn especially when she quickly drops the rental price from 500 00 a month to 400 00 alison agrees and upon leaving the building with miss logan notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top floor window miss logan identifies the man to her as father halliran and tells alison that he's blind alison's response is very logical blind then what does he look at after moving in alison meets some of the other residents in the building including a lesbian couple played by sylvia miles and beverly d'angelo who provide alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building alison's mental health and physical well being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells when she relays her concerns to miss logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself no one has lived in that building for the last three years summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs she is confronted by the cancer riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self defense when he comes after her the police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment no corpse no blood nothing yet alison fled the building and collapsed in the street covered in blood her own as it turns out but there's nary a mark on her what alison doesn't realize until the film's denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose she was put there for a reason a reason whose origin dates back to the biblical story of the garden of eden and of the angel uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the devil she is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the catholic church to assume a most important role one that will guarantee that her soul which is damned for her two suicide attempts can be saved at the same time the invisible neighbors who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs have a different agenda in mind for her this is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light
<START> my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british film makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called thatcher's britain the ealing comedies were intended as satires on attlee's britain the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and coronets which is if anything a satire on the edwardian upper classes or to the ladykillers or the lavender hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially passport to pimlico br br pimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly working class district of london set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about pimlico declaring itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy this means that technically pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply br br because pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the burgundians as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves to surrender br br many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the lavender hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in whisky galore or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the film's particular target is the rationing system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 and organisations such as the british housewives' league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the housewives' league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules' sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all br br i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in 1949 however four years after the end of the war the film makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain one of the best known lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and it's just because we are english that we're sticking up for our right to be burgundians there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics br br most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important br br there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton the grocer and small time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the ill will and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and coronets is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies 10 10
<START> this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a off watch enjoy it's funny
<START> i have to admit that over her dead body actually wasn't as bad as i was expecting my mom wanted to see it so i rented it i figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes but actually this wasn't too bad i was just expecting this horrific movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of eva longoria parker sorry she seems a little off set for the movie i think i may have found it to be a little better without her just she does annoy me but paul rudd and lake bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable but you have to admit there was no point to this movie it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing the movie could've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast br br henry just lost his bride to be kate who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day but when his sister takes him to a psychic ashley henry falls for her but kate is haunting her from beyond the grave kate is jealous and doesn't want henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that ashley doesn't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles believe me with kate's voice that's scary br br over her dead body is an alright movie not sure if it's worth the money but i'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious eva longoria just doesn't have enough star power to make the film work no offense to those who love her she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen not to mention the character of ashley she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls or her gay friend dan just again not really likable just with some re writing and proper attention this film could have been better but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling br br 4 10
<START> but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time and that takes some doing what with the likes of various lifetime efforts don't get me wrong i have nothing against cicely tyson i've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles look at sipsey in fried green tomatoes for example but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery and chew it she does with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas goose br br give me the classics anytime alastair sim 1951 with the exception maybe of scrooged all the others are just over the top efforts to grasp the past present or future spirit of christmas
