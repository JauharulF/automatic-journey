<START> as an adult i really did enjoy this one i watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1 2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice br br the music is fun and the animation is wonderful this sequel does what return to neverland didn't accomplish a good follow up to the cinderella story but what becomes of drusilla another sequel i hope so
<START> this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices br br movie history the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women when his wife discovered the film reels he was forced to quickly contrive a story he claimed he was making a movie called the brain that wouldn't die eventually his wife demanded that he show her his so called movie that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and the brain that wouldn't die was born br br i hate this movie plot synopsis the main character's fiancÃ© is killed in a horrible car accident that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it after reanimating the head he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie at the end he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet the monster appears with little to no explanation however the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after br br side notes the end credit screen claims that the movie is called the head that wouldn't die br br i hate this movie
<START> textbook example of an underestimated movie br br although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it it's still regarded as just another funny picture and although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers moon over parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and raul julia to mention one is not able to change this perception br br but after watching raul julia as roberto strausmann make richard dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion this stuff is timeless in fifty years we will have the proof
<START> as a pagan i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance it's a fun witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way that's a lesson everyone needs to learn not just pagans br br that having been said this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart br br hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca elsa lanchester with too many movie credits to mention except as ms jane marbles of murder by death was wonderful as ms novak's absent minded yet capable upstairs neighbor queenie also starring jack lemmon wonderful performance and jim kovacs brilliantly witty br br witches can't cry why they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick they don't have time for silly things such as love queenie br br gillian holroyd novak and her brother nicky jack lemmon are manhattan witches cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft they live among other new yorkers as one of them without so much as causing a raised eyebrow br br but then along comes shepherd shep henderson stewart a steadfast no nonsense dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillian's old college rival br br by a quirky mishap of chance he finds himself moving into gillian's building and is instantly bewitched by her charm and grace by the use of magick with a little help from pyewacket gillian's familiar trained by robert e blair and queenie gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy br br but magick should never be used to control nor to hurt and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way not only does she have to face what she's done but she has to face shep in her guilt br br from the critical perspective however the movie takes a serious turn the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home but at least the characters were quirky and fun br br on a personal note pyewacket steals the show great cat great training by robert e blair br br as a note of trivia this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom this introduces the original samantha and darrin all the characters of note are present and accounted for you have but to look to see it for yourself br br this is one of my favorites and i watch it often br br this movie gets a 9 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> let's hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i don't know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by br br tom and roseanne arnold i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote directed this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending aren't those glasses nifty and you get to keep them it's the equivalent of you just spent 9 00 making me rich here's 10 cents now don't you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special br br and freddy's had yet another face lift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of prosthetics he looks less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait they've done that and done that so i guess it doesn't matter but it mattered to me freddy is no longer scary he's just another low rent monster like the leprechaun br br it's more a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one liners and clever repartee sadly it fell short on both accounts br br so there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film br br it rates a 3 2 10 from br br the fiend
<START> right away this film was ridiculous not that it didn't have redeeming aspectsÂ for example the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery anyone not living on the east coast should know the south doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the west i knew it was utah right off the bat but perhaps dalton couldn't suppress his english accent so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town subverting his accent into a southern one was easier sure the film has plot twists but its phony sense of place was something i couldn't get past it's not like utah doesn't have meth labs so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me br br one other thing in action pictures always puzzles me why do they always make the cocking sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun it seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a chuk chich signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire of course the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary br br lastly the pyrotechnics were way over the top but hey this film was targeted to a certain 'market segment' i suppose it's too bad each of the actors can act but this film was lame
<START> noel coward a witty and urbane man was friends with louis mountbatten mr coward a long time admirer of all things naval was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of mountbatten's ship in a peculiarly british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda it was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the ship's captain amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated point songs does not come very high up the list at admiralty house or at least one would hope not a captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at drury lane and binkie beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question he folds himself languorously around the bridge patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home much is made of the warship as a microcosm of british society theme and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys canny northerners etc without whom no war can be fought they spend most of their time on board smoking moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up never mind there's plenty more where they came from once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up by contrast mr coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up he his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames that nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships mr coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master he marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion so yes we do have a microcosm of british society here but perhaps not in the way the makers of in which we serve intended at the end mr coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him goodbye edwards it was a privilege to sail with you he enunciates as if he was reciting how now brown cow it may have been david lean's feature debut but the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picture he was a funny and clever man better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song he had a talent to amuse no doubt but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue being noel coward was a full time job he had no time to be a real person
<START> when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock australia lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus lindy doesn't help matters either because she won't play to the jury or courtroom she's only herself and she's a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's a piece of evidence that hasn't come to light sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain a seventh day adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife it's good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too because the australian public doesn't believe the story and the media only fans the flames eventually lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and she's freed but not until after the family's life is basically ruined a heart breaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing 8 out of 10
<START> in what is a truly diverse cast this show hits it's stride on fox it is the kind of sitcom that grows on you if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much but once you watch two or three you get hooked br br this is because some of the jokes hit some miss depending upon how you view them as is usual today the themes are very mature the humor is usually very mature too often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones br br red kurtwood smith a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show debra jo rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too danny masterson the oldest actor of the kids is very good too laura prepon donna looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead who got the idea of making her a blonde she shows very good talent comedic timing often she looks good without make up too br br this is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department it's most successful live action one since married with children
<START> in cinema retro magazine 2 it is revealed that mark lester's voice was actually dubbed by a 20 year old female kathe green although leste was considered perfect for the title role director carol reed was not at all pleased with his singing abilities the secret was revealed by on a 2004 uk documentary titled oliver after they were famous greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation secret as did mark lester they kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the tv show decades after release of the film for the record mark lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in england
<START> dramatic license some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story in the case of lucy the main points of lucille ball's teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked way br br the main emotional points of lucy's life are made clear lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv's most memorable sitcom couple br br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strong willed yet likable and is very funny in her own right even though her comedic timing is different than lucy's she is still believable the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion br br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi's accent especially in the opening scene madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teen aged lucy br br vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles not that they aren't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at times br br although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucy's radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season also though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints the ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and off scale from the original as well the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured br br there's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucy's red scare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them it's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when obvious changes are made the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away the we're having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on by far the best was the grape stomping scene with rachel york really nailing lucy's mannerisms the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them these scenes proved effective because of that approach br br the film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy's life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy desi's marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively

<START> lorna green janine reynaud is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon it's quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someone a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love making is about to begin after the murders within her fantasies are committed lorna awakens bewildered often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality br br if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco i'd say it's elegant difficult by now you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career as far as film making style and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience and as you read from the reaction of the user comments here some like this decision others find the style labouring dull and bewildering i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head but even franco himself when quizzed by critics who watched succubus admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it some might say that succubus was merely a precursor to his more admired work venus in furs considered his masterwork by franco faithful because it also adopts the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he she is experiencing something real or imagined in a sense like the protagonist we are experiencing the same type of confusion certainly succubus is unconventional film making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on and a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters succubus is also populated by beatnik types and poet speak corman's film a bucket of blood poked fun at my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually great locations and jazz score i liked this film myself although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna a wee bit drunk writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig equally wasted rush her in an embrace of kisses
<START> i was born in 1982 most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80's and 90's i watched the groove tube for the first time in 2001 when i was 19 br br and i found it hilarious br br so for anybody who thinks that something dated can't be quite funny 30 years later think again it's funny even if you have no idea what the 70's were like and the thought of bell bottom pants make you cringe who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature there is plenty to laugh at the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best
<START> even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn't join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
<START> although i had some hopes for this film particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason segel freaks geeks undeclared so much i must say it was one of the worst films i've seen in recent memory loser and dr t and the women are also on that list br br yes there were a couple of laugh out loud moments although the movie could have been so much better the premise was not bad scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they're discovered by someone with a proposition for them the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable that i didn't care about any of them the blackmailer played by talented jason schwartzman was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him he wasn't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way he was just a crazy loser who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch the editing of the movie was hard to follow it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists showing their schemes would have made for a better movie the so called love story was absurd and unbelievable in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout i could go on about the movie's shortcomings but you get the idea not worth the 4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent
<START> this isn't another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein jutta lampe is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side ruth's daughter hannah maria schrader slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer doris schade and so she travels to germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse br br spoiler alert br br lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release eight year old ruth svea lohde awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena katja riemann who takes her in lena's husband fabian martin feifel is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do something br br this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved this film isn't trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and it's always good to see schrader aimee jaguar in a pivotal role this isn't a great film or something that's going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story
<START> as an aging rocker this movie mentions heep and quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline i just love this piece of creative genius i cannot recommend it more highly and mick jones added so much foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever lou gramm i have watched this great work more than 10 times bill nighy what a voice and jimmy nail talent oozes from every pore then astrid and karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 10 10 bloody brilliant br br alastair perth western oz originally from windsor england
<START> the world is made up two different types of moviegoers there are the english patient types who can't be bothered to enjoy anything that isn't high brow enough to be shown on pbs and there are the happy gilmore types for whom an hour and a half of genitalia puns are definitely worth the 7 br br certainly there's a ton of gray area but you know to which side you're leaning if you're an english patient person save your time save your money and save us all your oh this movie is so childish and stupid comments i know you thoroughly enjoy belittling every movie you don't like and every person that likes them but maybe you could hold off just this once br br but if you're a happy gilmore type go see this one you'll find it hilarious tim meadows has created a hilarious character and will farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does go check it out you'll be glad you did and that's ok
