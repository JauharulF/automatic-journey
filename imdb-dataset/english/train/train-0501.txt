<START> this film which is based on a true story comes from first time director and long time actor denzel washington denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade as a black soldier in the civil war in glory and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia and of course he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor i guess denzel wanted a change of pace so he chose to direct antwone fisher in which he also stars fisher is played by derek luke who is new to the silver screen but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyz br br this is a truly well done film from denzel washington considering it was his first time directing undoubtedly denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport played by denzel washington davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison what makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting with a lot of swearing fighting and vulgarity not that i didn't like good will hunting or the swearing fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place quite the contrary however antwone fisher is a true story and i don't think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film don't get me wrong there are moments when we see antwone fighting carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him after all in his first session with his psychiatrist the character played by washington devenport asks fisher where he was born and fisher's response is from under a rock ' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fisher's soul but i had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichÃ©s that are common in hollywood films even those based on true stories one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting over all performances were good in the film but not great at times i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors but overall to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis she plays antwone's mother but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all but not so much because she appears at the end of the film but more because she in shock that her long lost son antwone has found her what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her she in basically a character actress and i haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles she made appearances in traffic out of sight kate leopold and two recent films far from heaven and solaris in steven soderberg's remake of solaris she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet in that film she is confronted by george clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene when i first saw solaris i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking wow this woman can act it was as if you could feel the character's grief in that brief shot of her face she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles rather than just as a character driven actress nonetheless antwone fisher is a very good movie denzel washington as always pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut also derek luke is a very talented actor i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz which also stars lawrence fishburn antwone fisher is based on the book finding fish a memoir ' by antwone quenton fisher
<START> allow me to just get to the bottom line here i've got 3 kids ages 5 to 10 i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz the over 18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red nosed reindeer i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone br br what makes me support the one child of mine it varies who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening in a word showerman br br moment of silence br br sigh
<START> it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake there's nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop
<START> anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times but that is its intention it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be bret carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has the intention and the message is clear and profound people's apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities an open minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it sometimes a life changing realization does come in a flash a light bulb going on this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way
<START> an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution however he is not any ordinary extra he is serguis alexander former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander it can now be the time for this broken man to finally win his penultimate battle this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg providing the greatest irony in alexander's character in every way he can jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings' love all around brilliance rating 10
<START> nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an audience like or empathize with any of the characters either there are movies so bad they are good a la ed wood or tod slaughter films and there's just plain bad like 99 of uwe boll's work this film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented mstie riffer e g mystery science theatre 3000 thankfully while i am rather talented in that regard it's how my mind works all the time for those who are not so naturally talented in mstie riffing eventually into this film you'll just want to pull your own head off painfully aware the movie taboo robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back even my mstie talents were barely a match for this slow paced boring waste of time the most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone green lit and or funded it i rented taboo solely for the normally talented amber benson who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film i've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue the reviews to which i'd better read first ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location
<START> considering the risk of showing same sex relationships before the late 1980's personal best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between hemingway chris cahill and donnelly tory skinner as a more than experimental phase of cahill's life br br it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 oregon track and field competition br br this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel hemingway's body and the same sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film br br pepper thompson
<START> you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies even the really bad ones why to see their heroes in action one more time that's the way i feel about doc savage i am a major fanatic for the character and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie resulting in a somewhat disjointed film there's a lot of promise in here diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music the camp elements etc but the spirit of doc is there and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to so in my long winded way what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it's just not as good as it should have been and anyone who is a fan of superman james bond indiana jones buckaroo banzai and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all
<START> having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it doesn't every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments and this movie isn't bad at all br br the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties films were pretty much a happy medium back then the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television i don't know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes br br teen idol pat boone plays nick conover a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta jeanette nolan and uncle jed arthur o'connell out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son jed jr so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums story lines like this being what they are jed and nick don't really care for each other too much of course jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors fran dolores michaels and liz shirley jones templeton immediately jed develops a crush on fran and of course i don't have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed then there's the matter of uncle jed's horse a trotter who has turned wild and won't let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises doesn't matter though you'll enjoy yourself anyway br br once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone as a supposedly bad boy you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film considering that boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick certainly the role doesn't require much depth but still it's a nicely done job when you would least expect it as jed arthur o'connell is the perfect choice for the role in the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to nick we see that he's really a pretty good guy jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents as liz she's gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times dolores michaels as fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertaining br br the best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen not one true villain in the whole thing everybody is so darn likable you can't help but enjoy the film i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them another thing i really liked is that they didn't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it as a matter of fact you'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn't skimp in that department the chemistry between jones and boone is good best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect br br this movie will never be confused with great cinema yet sometimes instead of going to disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and that's what april love is br br my grade b br br
<START> jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier but did that movie saved him i think he goes to hell after he dies br br in the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad guy of the film scary huh but not as scary as the acting details are following br br then we see van damme with a black girl do not remember the name well it doesn't matter anyway trying to escape from some muscle men of course they are the new universal soldiers more muscels less brain just like the movie after a while van damme fights goldberg but then the mission gets aborted it was just a test is this movie a test for our nerves it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing that yould van dammes character could do but it is a sequel and a story has to come up ah i forgot he has a daughter very important for the story br br well after about 20 minutes a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him it wants van damme as a soldier because he is the best really and guess what goldberg is one of the hunters who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked funny yes just like the rest of the film br br after some story van damme tries to rescue his daughter of his wife the reporter in the first movie it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie please see for yourself it is just too funny to tell br br you'll see that this movie is a waste of time br br so do not watch it but if you do keep a sixpack with you
<START> this despite not being the original it began life as a play in central europe has weathered the several incarnations that followed mgm's own remake with period songs in the good old summertime the broadway show she loves me even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of years ago and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today try for example removing ugarte ferrari renault etc from casablanca and yes you'd still have rick and ilsa and viktor lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below jimmy stewart and maggie sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of frank morgan felix bressart joseph schildkraut and andy hardy's sara haden and this is before we factor in that lubitsch 'touch' okay maybe they were a tad more naive innocent even in that jurassic age but how many genuine film lovers sated with scatology screwing and in your face sex turn back to those days of stories style slickness and skill and wallow in great movies like this one by far the best thing about this technological age is not csi but dvd that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it
<START> the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as plot and character the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark out of focus and blurry the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn't help on the other hand the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole gaggle of women on the side though he does show his anti social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b d who's just minding his own business images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci maybe it ruined his career but it wasn't really much more stupid than zombie worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help
<START> if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman the animated series i for one think it failed terribly the character drawing is lousy catwoman for instance looks awful but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle without the help of two even three sidekicks i mean he's batman for god's sake i know the comic books i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batman's allies besides robin but still making batman say that he needs help from them what he can't handle a few punches in btas he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem he's getting old come on br br and another thing i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training one it's irresponsible and batman is everything but irresponsible and two it's not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them br br batman the animated series made history with its animation its stories and its characters that really was a legend of batman the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick
<START> i saw this movie when it was new later i rented it in japan after having been here three years afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania where i'm from not all the stuff is factually spot on but the tone is perfect br br i'm still in japan many years later and i continue to enjoy this film for its even handed treatment of the two sides in the story interestingly although the japanese american actors spoke japanese in the original the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second language delivery problems br br i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the serious books on the matter most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies br br don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one star reviewers who among other things found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us of course the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichÃ©s like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music michael keaton has never been funnier
<START> in many ways dirty work is a predictable l h short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone s chimney guess what happens next that s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues br br but there s one or two things that seem untypical ollie for example is very unlikable he s arrogant he s rude and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with hey you and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being i have nothing to say in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he s always at his funniest br br dirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other l h shorts like finlayson long busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie br br having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan also watch out for a scene featuring a fish many jokes plots from l h feature fish and this is another one
<START> i haven't seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by i'm compelled to see more the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva an unemployed mother of two discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i won't reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film i recommend it to anyone any adult don't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it's a family film who love comedy even those unfamiliar with the language
<START> this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david croft who wrote tv's best programme ever dads army was not as good as dads army but still very very funny br br it is about a concert band in india most episodes were about bsm williams windsor davies trying to get the concert party who he referred to as a bunch of puffs posted up the jungle he was always unsuccessful as the vague colonel reynolds donald hewlett and the stupid captain ashwood michael knowles were big fans of the concert party the concert party consisted of bombadier solomans george layton ginger rogers impersonator gunner gloria beaumont melvyn hayes university educated piano player gunner la de da gunner graham a k a padarouski john clegg singer gunner lofty sugden gunner parkins christopher mitchell williams thought parkins was his son he was quite wrong big eater gunner nosher evans and animal impersonator's kenneth macdonald he was no percy edwards also heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant rangi ram michael bates with the char wallah and the punkah wallah dino shafeek and babar bhatti giving ram wonderful support br br the show just like dads army left many catchphrases rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah don't be such clever dickie and he ended a lot of the shows saying here is a very old hindu proverb e g when wife is having affair with best friend it doesn't stop your house from catching fire it was williams though who had the most catchphrases he would always shout shuddup say oh dear how sad never mind and when talking to gunner graham he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent br br this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did this is probably due to a question of taste this is seen as being crude williams is homophobic calling his men puffs though it has to be said williams is a bore also some people think there is a racial element in the humour using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist i know someone who is half indian and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show when i see an episode for the first time i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom but when i see it second time round i don't laugh all that much but no matter how many times i see dads army i laugh many times in an episode br br best episode the road to banu series 1 episode 7
<START> by no means is this movie as bad as 'perfect stranger' but it just wasn't funny it couldn't stick to one type of comedy it jumped from snl to adam sandler esquire to romantic to little guy scores big to slapstick to 'loser' the movie types of comedies although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments the fall down the hill no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way 'schindler's list' was funnier and felt shorter you never knew if andy samberg was supposed to be in high school a college dropout or just a loser living at home with his mother sissy spacek in her worst choice of roles and poor ian mcshane the serious actor if i only had to name one is given crap to read into the camera the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end no spoilers here in case adam samberg's mom wants to see it don't spend any money going to see this movie and maybe lorne michaels will get the hint and start producing quality yes wayne's world and tommy boy are quality movies
<START> this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the writer director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious it has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions dominic monaghan really became the insomniac he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really poured his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative writer director cinematographer
<START> making a book into a movie by following the story page by page is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybody's mind's eye opus is different which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a ticked off segment of the movie going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up br br all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see br br there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying carrie 'salem's lot the dead zone or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd awful mess kubrick's version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers br br although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation pet sematary has so many moments of just skin and bone deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings for that we have music video turned film director mary lambert to thank she also directed siesta not exactly a horror movie but another freaky as hell must see you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the 'man ster' himself and probably one of his better ones br br since the majority of you know the story i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details dr louis creed dale midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math it is a king story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br it's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream inducing life here rachel creed's star trek's denise crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow brad greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery and that third act if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse br br good performances by all here especially the late fred gwynne as the well intentioned neighbor jud crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up sometimes dead is better br br about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son gage miko hughes knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately hughes at the time was just too damn cute to sell his intended role as an evil demon possessed zombie this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged especially gwynne's death scene br br other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned but sematary is right up there in the top five br br still will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story not bloody likely for now
