<START> the longer this film went on and it seemed to tediously go on for ever the more annoyed i became as quite frankly what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense how on earth do people get to make films like this or indeed receive finance for such rubbish don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal 'gun culture' br br anyhow br br the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children a teenage girl and boy taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice versa and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser br br the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally br br ask yourself br br who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash br br this film is pointless drivel br br it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music br br 2 10
<START> the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichÃ©s which do not offer a real cross cultural insight the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick villages dirt tracks in the middle of the desert women clad in black robes and belly dancers i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible br br the original idea might have been interesting but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight you should skip this movie
<START> a film written and directed by neil young greendale is little more than an 87 minute music video set to a doxen or so of the songwriter's works in lieu of dialogue the film relies exclusively on young's lyrics which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary to tell the story while actors act out the scenes br br given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture the effect is the equivalent of young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption although there is allegedly a story running through the film we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting all we get for eighty seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack the whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self indulgence greendale gives off hollywood low budget movie making a bad name
<START> i rented this movie for a few laughs i had never seen the snl skit but with hits like tommy boy and waynes world it couldn't have been that bad could it the answer it was this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part but there wasn't any the highlight was tiffany amber thieson and thats just about it
<START> riding giants br br this documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well made and acclaimed surfer films dana brown's endless summer its follow up endless summer ii by bruce brown dana's son and step into liquid imax i saw the first not the others br br while the surfing footage is spectacular i valued most the film maker's historic perspective he takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to its present form this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers how surfboard designs changed over time which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the world class surfers and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches surfed from dawn to dusk camped on rudimentary bunks fished for food and went back out on their boards the next day what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days br br we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start what was the biggest boost to the sport believe it or not it was the movie gidget although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys' surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing who knew there was such a tome are mentioned for their contributions we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport their families and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s one such story is how 40 year old laird hamilton considered today's greatest surfer bonded with an earlier leading surfer introduced him to his single mom who he married before becoming his step dad br br a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story have i whetted your appetite wonderful have a great ride
<START> there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible re was a survival horror game and a damn effective one at that yet paul ws anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil so of course there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie instead alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies br br the plot despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter is the largest of many problems with the movie the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important as after a minute passes the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them then there's something about an orphanage some artefacts an ancient tribe some bureaucracy and some demons all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on characters move in and out of the plot like candy some having huge build ups for meaningless deaths basically what i can understand is that some demons got released and edward carnby slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex girlfriend anthropologist reid who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason then out of nowhere all hell breaks loose and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander dorff who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby br br it's all ridiculous and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled but it leaves no room for anyone to really care instead i highly recommend that if you must see this film bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion br br the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right too bad this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens considering that this is based on a horror game not an action game it is especially annoying br br the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness and the rest isn't all that great either the demons look somewhat cool though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night br br the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning br br in all this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the spirit like this it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middle easterns with an ak 47 and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesn't deserve a second chance as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is it's bland uninteresting and unexciting this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea it's all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end you're just glad it's over br br total 4
<START> a brilliant portrait of a traitor victor mclaglen in oscar winning performance who is hounded by his own conscience mclaglen plays an ira rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during ireland's sinn fein rebellion the scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic focusing on the desperation within individuals the lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death br br director john ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the irish landscape max steiner's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight oscar winner also for best screenplay nominated for best picture this is one of hollywood's classic

<START> beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes and to be honest that's all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously side splitting br br the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washing up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to life br br and aside from the double headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure genius br br the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existence br br
<START> can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck br br somehow hugh jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment br br i would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily ever after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d

<START> the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair br br then our hero who is called tenshu is taken to the chair he's zapped and then he's still alive aha he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story commences br br he wakes up in a different sort of cell very high tech and very big where he finds another cell mate who also managed to survive the electric boogie ride a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept what else can they do br br what these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them basically the unknown scientists in the background p s them off until they decide that they should kill each other sounds weird indeed but there's a greater purpose to all of this this is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain unrevealed br br but fear not it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo action movie fore it has an entirely different approach to the question how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s o b and would you kill him to obtain freedom br br the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest it sneaks up without you actually knowing it then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix like action fight scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon br br the movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances however the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly unique br br if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash br br
<START> in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey so i nearly skipped this film which had its tcm preview recently on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ghost train which i expected to be thoroughly annoying instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre one can feel moreover the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here as for the rest of the film the more movies you've seen the more likely you'll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance
<START> arahan adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow's films is a mistake br br firstly the fight scenes are nothing new all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang tony jaa and jackie chan fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the matrix sequels br br the attractive female lead so yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in house of flying daggers having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake see aya ueto in asumi unless you are a very talented director which as arahan proves seung wan ryoo is not
<START> fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b
<START> i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it
<START> watching truth about love is this a double entendre about the star is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep you put it in the dvd slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day and it works for that for that purpose being a british romantic comedy it is a bit more br br the story is a rather simple one about a wife alice jennifer love hewitt married to an increasingly distant husband sam jimi mistry who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice his partner archie dougray scott is fond of both sam and alice but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship alice pals with her sister felicity kate miles a free love advocate who encourages alice to have affairs on valentine's day after a drinking binge with her sister alice mails a card to sam signed 'anonymous' as a test to see if sam responds testing his fidelity at the same time archie mails a radish seed packet to alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not both have ex post facto regrets sam in fact is spending time with a lover katya branka katic and is indeed cheating on alice alice arranges assignations with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as 'anonymous' to test his fidelity the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise of sorts of the fluffy script br br british comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting perhaps had director john hay elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of pasting a phony accent on jennifer love hewitt the result may have been improved but in the end this story by peter bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music white noise grady harp
<START> okay guys we know why we watch film like the invisible maniac just look at the cover man t and a all over the place with a lot more t than a but shouldn't there be a story to go with it br br c'mon i can hear you say this is just girls gettin' naked who needs a story br br well if this were called the naked maniacs i wouldn't have a problem but since these guys are cribbing from the invisible man they need to have a bit of story hereabouts you know to keep your mind busy br br however all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and when he cracks uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers and when you see the smarmy looking teenagers he goes after you'll be grateful br br one star for the t and a but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans so proceed with caution br br tidbit yes it's that savannah
<START> storyline max von sydow's voice over narration hypnotizes the protagonist and audience back to 1945 where our protagonist the young american ideologist leopold kessler jean marc barr has just arrived in post wwii 1945 germany to help rebuilding the damaged country uncle kessler ernst hugo jÃ¤regÃ¥rd supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann barbara sukowa daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann jÃ¸rgen reenberg leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption being taken advantage of losing his ideology and is forced to chose between pest or colera br br mysterious mesmerizing manipulative noirish haunting beautiful and ugly these are some immediate grandiose descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von trier's 1991 masterpiece europa the final chapter of the europa trilogy in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences wouldn't confuse it with agnieszka holland's europa europa from 1990 equally a wwii drama the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987 the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the danish cinemas the trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals in the opening shot of europa we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us on the mental count of ten you will be in europa be there at ten i say ten a metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream reality br br europa utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style that famous russian director andrei tarkovsky is trier's main influence says it all it's a black and white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood a red dress etc according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindler's list from 1993 coincidentially another wwii drama furthermore trier uses so called dutch angels and reinvents background projection by adding separately shot co operating layers upon layers but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons trier uses it for artistic reasons these carefully executed strange looking visual techniques underline that we are in a dream reality we are hypnotized the universe of europa is not real europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique such as multi layered background projection above plot and characters but hey that's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey for nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema history books br br europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness apparently trier assigns the nazis' werewolf terrorist group too much historical significance according to various online sources that's correct a fascinating subject try googl'ing it yourself yet trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately europa is a never ending nightmare leopold kessler is hypnotized therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality equally it shows how our memory deceives us a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose they inform us us that we are not in post wwii germany 1945 but in leopolds memory of it br br all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities before during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland lars von trier and co writer niels vÃ¸rsel were extremely interested in wwii it shows it's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time period spot on a great example is the old polish church europa was shot in poland primarily for economic reasons in the last act of europa as with 2001 space odyssey i think europa will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinema history its method of twisting old film noir love affair clichÃ©s and visual techniques is so unique strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays or any other dream factory for that matter br br europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog some write it off as pure commercial speculation but that would be catastrophic it's right up there with other trier classics and semi classics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984 the tv series riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003 it's a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors and before the dogme95 manifesto watch it on the count of ten 9 10
<START> this is an atrocious movie two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man there's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a spoiler i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously all the while grinning psychotically at the camera add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again including a vaudevillian song about dear old dad that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees the music is annoying at first then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen the theme here is of youth run amok understandable as a reaction to the '60s but done with little imagination or style avoid it
