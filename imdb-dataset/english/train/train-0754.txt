<START> as shallow as it may sound i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gayÂ just trashy cheesy campy and enormously fun it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato director of cannibal holocaust of all people was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword sandal fantasy flicks particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies the film opens with a terrific 'once upon a time' type of off screen narrator introducing us to the ragneks their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers in other words the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby meanwhile and as some sort of amusing waste of time the two orphan twin brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death instead of that however they escape and develop a plan to free their queen actually the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters like a dragon with adorably cute eyes some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds the supportive cast is splendid as well eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut shaped hair style i kid you not last but not least the barbarians stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people but the barbarians really is a must see italian exploitation highlight
<START> this was the most visually stunning moving amazing and incredible story i've ever experienced quite frankly even those adjectives just cannot describe it i can't just choose one scene that stood out for me i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence br br on that day and even now i am reminded of star wars 1977 obi wan says i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced ' it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description there was truly a disturbance in the force br br this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance the feelings are so incredibly visual the anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude it's all there not a thing is missed br br this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy not just because it documents 9 11 but because it is simply everything it should be br br if you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of tissues you'll need them i know that i did
<START> this was the best muppet movie i've seen ever i happen to know that miss piggy's fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies the songs will remain in my head forever only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head sorry a little off the topic there but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye hasta luego that made me laugh so hard my absolute favorite is the play at the end i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding i'm just glad this movie was very entertaining i borrowed it from the library and now i have bought it because i can't keep the library's copy forever in conclusion i proclaim this is the best movie i've ever seen in my case it's even better than austin powers in goldmember which was my favorite movie
<START> after seeing the poster from the film smother i knew i was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out however i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the movie unfortunately that did not happen smother is a horrible movie but it is not execrable that is the best i can say about it br br the screenplay from smother written by the same guys from license to wed something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies is full of cheap and predictable humor seriously i did not laugh even once watching this film besides the solid cast i previously mentioned is absolutely wasted after the big number of garbage she has been involved in like the monumentally atrocious and execrable because i said so some people may think the career from diane keaton is extinguishing however it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades on films like annie hall or baby boom on smother she makes her best effort with her performance but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it dax shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films baby mama and idiocracy however he does what he can with his character mike white also makes a good effort but he does not reach too far away he is a very talented screenwriter like he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock so i would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie instead of only acting on it liv tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors being wasted br br the worst fail from smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit coms stay far away from this crappy comedy
<START> the morbid catholic writer gerard reve jeroen krabbÃ© that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen while in the railway station in amsterdam he feels a non corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag renÃ©e soutendijk who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx and they have one night stand on the next morning gerard sees the picture of christine's boyfriend herman thom hoffman and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of seducing the man christine travels to kÃ¶ln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe finding three film reels with names of men he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband br br the ambiguous the vierde man is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs magnificent performance of jeroen krabbÃ© in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer and stunning cinematography the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films however paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism last but not the least the androgynous beauty of the sexy renÃ©e soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer my vote is eight br br title brazil o 4o homem the 4th man
<START> as the one line summary says two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater the one was stir of echoes with kevin bacon and the second was vanilla sky br br its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants walking out of the cinema was a bit weird like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything one of those movies that you become one with the guy and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie br br one thing is certain the actors are awesome the sound track is excellent and everything in the movie is 9 br br surely one of the best movies i ever saw and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world
<START> the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart rending books i have ever read it tells the amazing stories of two sisters both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist then lived another 30 years with dignity ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious blacker bessie the dentist she not only expresses her anger angst and wisdom well she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister the teacher down perfectly but i'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100 no matter the stories are well worth telling amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter this too is only a minor distraction the stories all true are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation most of them make it through just fine br br i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to i cannot quite but this tv movie in that rarefied air but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right
<START> the man in the white suit like i'm all right jack takes a dim view of both labor and capital alec guinness is a scientific genius but an eccentric one he has never gotten his university degree due to an err accident in a college laboratory he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry when the film begins he is in michael gough's company and gough in a memorable moment is trying to impress his would be father in law cecil parker by showing him the ship shape firm he runs while having lunch with parker and parker's daughter joan greenwood gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems he reads the huge expenditures due to guinness's experiments and chokes on his coffee br br guinness goes on to work at parker's firm and repeats the same tricks he did with gough but parker discovers it too greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on and convinces parker to continue the experiments but now legally the result guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that for all intents and purposes the fiber will remain in tact for good any textile made from it will never fade get dirty or wear out it will last forever br br guinness has support from a female shop steward but not her chief he sees guinness as selling out to the rich but when he explains to them what he's done they turn against him if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes soon parkers' fellow textile tycoons led by gough ernest theisinger in a wonderful performance and howard marion crawford are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses they seek to suppress the invention with only greenwood in his corner although parker sort of sympathizes with him guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public br br in the end guinness is defeated by science as well as greed but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all br br it's a brilliant comedy but is the argument for suppression valid at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat or contract if the owner gets thin are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever what happened to fashion changes and new styles and the cloth is only made in the color white making guinness look like a white knight we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile br br alas this is not a science paper but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry as such it is brilliant but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness' invention
<START> the plot was quite interesting with the russian revolution background i also enjoyed seeing budapest as the movie was partly filmed there sadly there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them the love scenes were forced and mechanical jordan kirckland was really stiff almost icy rob stewart was quite charming and boyish so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend the ending when we finally figure out who was actually after them was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever i think i would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible
<START> omen iv 1991 was a bad made for t v movie since the 80's were over i guess the executives were experimenting in meth the drug of choice during the 90's because there is no other reason to explain this travesty why did they even bother making this a t v movie what were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as perhaps they thought it could make it as a series we'll never know but i know one thing this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this extra disc br br omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film instead of a snot nosed punk kid we get the spooky girl who's a total brat to everyone around her if the family had stronger parenting skills then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline br br not recommended best to avoid at all cost
<START> having watched this movie on the scifi channel i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences or delights as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me the plot isn't really worth commenting as but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory before the movie is over we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe yet then jumps off and a whole collection of further bizarre occurrences basically if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies avoid this film like the plague or as my friend reading over my shoulder says it's the best movie i have ever seen to which the friend on my right says only battle techno music could have made it better
<START> this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer's or who are in the formative stages i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line
<START> i've been looking for the name of this film for years i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983 all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl alone having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon i remember people were looking for her family and that she knew how to take care of herself she narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin i don't remember much else about this movie and want to see it again if this is the same one and if any of you have a copy could you email me at horsecoach4hire hotmail com i'd be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember it was aired on thanksgiving us in 1983 and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me thanks in advance
<START> i don't know if i'm just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film br br return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one i also thought that the cast in this movie was great judd nelson is always the best i also enjoyed the plot as a whole i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley's screenplay cabin by the lake it wasn't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them if you're looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you however if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film
<START> for romantic comedies i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience unfortunately for the wedding date i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears br br my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters the premise of the film is a reverse pretty woman with dermot playing the role of nick a high priced male escort hired by debra's character kat to accompany her to england for her sister's wedding a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial and there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat br br in a supporting role amy adams was a standout as kat's sister whenever amy came on screen she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat the film might have had more dynamism but as it turned out instead of reaching for kleenex i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance
<START> honestly barbra i know it's you who's klicking all those no s on my review 22 times how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here don't you have anything better to do like look at yourself in the mirror all day br br steven spielberg told barbra that this was the best movie i've seen since 'citizen kane' that pretty much says it all and serves as a dire warning br br what are the ingredients for a sure fire cinematic disaster and one that will haunt you never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain the ingredients barbra streisand's face a musical feminism barbra streisand's voice barbra streisand directing and an ultra corny idiotic premise br br hollywood is full of egomaniacs this much we know in fact nearly everyone Â by definition Â has to be an egomaniac in hollywood why would anyone want to act for the art well if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviewsÂ and streisand has the biggest ego of them all this is quite an achievement to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and yet to manage to top them all Â remarkable br br the movie like all her solo endeavors is an ego trip straight out of hell every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined stillborn but as it that weren't enough she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs Â you know the kind that enabled the mariah careys the celine dions and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades now just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking her br br the premise streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi sounds like a zany zaz comedy apart from it being a clichÃ© the obvious problem is that streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does she look like a man Â in fact i'm not even sure she's human the way she looks in this movie wellÂ it cannot be described in words e t looks like a high school jock by comparison she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year 2015 she looks horrible br br the songs they made me shiver particularly papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat and tomorrow night i'll prepare the sequel yentl 2 the return of the bitch br br did you know that streisand considered having a nose job early on in her career but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change can you believe that she should have done it killing two flies with one swipe that's what it would have been br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by e mail br br should barbra streisand finally go into retirement click yes or no
<START> this comic book style film is funny has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it writer steven de souza who also wrote commando gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out send me a copy after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back what a pain in the neck after strangling subzero with barbed wire he had to split after slicing his body between his legs and finally as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face arnie concludes now that hit the spot funnily enough bears some similarities total recall another sci fi flick starring schwarzenegger
<START> as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters there's nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness i've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness it's like poke people don't act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately there's not even that much action to make up for that
<START> the acting was bad the script was bad and the ending was just terrible the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up but apart from that this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001 why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it why
<START> i've seen better production quality on youtube i pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much it's a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie it certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing which was amateurish even the english actors sounded weird
