<START> usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case here br br bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0 10 film it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons' hard work would amount to more a truly awful film
<START> i wasn't going to watch this show but i'm glad i did the critics of this just don't get it it's one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t v at the present moment though when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and it's a laugh riot i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless the husband and wife birds talking about health problems and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up creature comforts is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile hopefully it will be back next summer when this run is over
<START> i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out as a result i don't remember anything about the movie but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilley's and the mechanical bull to johnny lee's hit song lookin' for love which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it br br however a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is i was blown away few movies have hit me harder this movie is as raw and real as you can get from uncle bob's ranch house the chemical plant in texas city gilley's dance hall and bud and sissy and maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal but no matter how you feel about country music i for one can't stand it despite my houston roots urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie for that reason i love it
<START> i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great ruby br br in paradise is one of her best it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals they were very good movies br br also but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of ashley's best br br
<START> this warning against anti semitism is well meant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film the director has no idea about mise en scene the cast varies from bad till even worse br br the great austrian comic hans moser is wasted in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr caligari one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities br br the restored copy i saw dutch filmmuseum gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well
<START> the king maker is a film about a series of real citation needed events that occurred during the portuguese occupation in indochina br br although the costumes and art direction are commendable the movie still fails to impress the viewer the acting in particular was extremely poor some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents both real and fake are extremely irritating the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an asian version of elizabeth br br final say costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion in short the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script
<START> this show probably won't appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert if you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn't for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedians of comedy jay johnston mr show steve agee bobcat goldthwait's 'stay' and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel101 com if you're into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on vh1 this march it'll be drawing from the same talent pool br br watch sarah silverman's show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment
<START> i don't know what you guys are talking about the first time i watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't stop crying this is one of the funniest shits i've ever seen that comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha br br yeah this movie actually is the worse but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters poor dialog and acting not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it it looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed class the props look like they came out of a high school drama show the music sounds like it is from an original nintendo system game the only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which who isn't creeped out by fat lurking clowns hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions hahahaha i died br br susan
<START> this movie was messed up a sequel to john carpenter's vampires this didn't add up right i'm not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange stick to the first vampires it's a good movie vampires los muetos wasn't a good attempt of a sequel br br 4 10
<START> 'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi ethnic britain rather like 'bend it like beckham' or more closely 'east is east' with which it shares a 1970s setting the tone is resolutely chirpy in spite of the dour black country accents but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite moreover the portrayal of the film's central relationship between an asian girl and her white friend is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story 'east is east' was fun and sharp 'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison
<START> well i was excited at first to download an animated open source movie only to be ruined by a demo reel the animation is excellent the lip syncing is awful and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on only to realize nothing is going on you feel no emotion for the characters only pity for the creators for wasting their time i have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time this could of been an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director i'm sure everyone over at blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities but sorry guys story telling is what makes a movie
<START> george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune he interviews her on her yacht they fall for each other in bathing costumes br br it turns out quite early that she is not an heiress she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream br br the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance br br the supporting cast does little to buoy it up davis and brent carry the picture though it's fairly predictable it is also fairly entertaining it's far from her best but especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre it's not one of her worst either
<START> i really wanted to like this film and i don't think i was terribly disappointed being an american history teacher i felt an obligation almost to see this film and as far as the history went it wasn't bad sure there were a few mistakes here and there especially with the timeline the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year not over six years of actual fighting but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent unfortunately the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist for the most part it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed tacked on like a plot device instead of a real honest to goodness romance in fact as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb clichÃ© of love at fist sight it was kind of annoying the more i think about it br br however in spite of this romance the film is truly interesting and inspiring plus in so many ways it seems as if the much later film the patriot was copied from this griffith film both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians and both having the secret intention of using this as a springboard to starting their own nation in the america the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d w griffith for the story ideas it just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other br br ps despite me liking this film and some other of griffith's films he does deserve to once again burn in hell for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films especially in birth of a nation i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this quaint institution don't get mad at me this is meant as sarcasm
<START> this movie got off to an interesting start down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals the male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax in comparison this is boomerang meets extremities br br
<START> this movie is not for everyone you're either bright enough to get it or you're not fans of sci fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films you'll probably enjoy this one the voice characterizations are done in a tongue in cheek manner and the one liners fly fast and furious
<START> while i have a great respect for disney's animated films as of late they haven't really been what i would call must see atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer and thankfully lived up to my expectations br br atlantis is a more mature disney film in the sense that it lacks songs a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering the world of atlantis hidden beneath the earth's core is fantastic presented as desolate caverns with ruins and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems which while usually containing some reminder of harshness become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached the presentation of simply atlantis' landscape and setting without some expendable cheery song gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance the inclusion of an atlantean language as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real life ancient civilizations adds to this and works fairly well br br also with the exception of some scenes involving mole's practical jokes there didn't seem to be much of a childish element that i usually associate with disney films instead the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about part of this involves the atlantean weaponry which is used in a very action packed climax which is for lack of a better word quite exciting br br granted not all of the story makes full sense and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer generated visual effects but aside from the toy story movies this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years
<START> i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don't remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film br br i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye
<START> i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap what a waste of time beverly d'angelo and william katt wtf were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something br br truly a piece of unfunny garbage the characters were stereotypical without meaning to i think and wooden most of them seemed like they were on autopilot the so called hilarious situations described in some of the other so called reviews were so hackneyed i weeped for the writers br br i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time seriously i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 it would need to be either five hours long or feature more kelly lebrock
<START> if you havn't seen this movie i highly recommend you do it's an excellent true story i love alison lohman she is so talented side note i also loved her in 7th heaven the whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome the acting in this film is br br very awesome
<START> question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does here br br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are great br br there are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senile br br a delight br br enterrrrrr
