<START> men do i love police movies filled with action shooting chases etcetera br br boy was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie we've seen it all before the hostages the bank the surrounding yet 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire without getting hit due to some kevlar br br not just a few shots no hundreds of shots going back into the bank where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out how stupid did the director think we'd be br br okay the shots in between that fake a documentary were good but after seeing the film i only got the thought why didn't the police get a decent shooting course and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break truly bad
<START> apparently none of the previous reviewers most of whom praise the film for its accuracy have actually read a biography of louis pasteur the most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between pasteur and napoleon iii back in the 1930's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light while far from an admirable character he was an inept politician and a self appointed military genius who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous war he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here he had an intelligent interest in science and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring far from exiling pasteur he was his patron building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research while the lab was under construction pasteur became gravely ill a bureaucrat deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead ordered work halted on his own authority when the emperor heard about this his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck passing and work promptly resumed the emperor personally visited pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab the emperor would often bring members of his court to admire pasteur's projects and it was obvious to everyone that pasteur was one of the emperor's favorites pasteur's main worry concerning the emperor was that napoleon thought pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience pasteur a very modest man was always protesting this but napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him and pasteur despite his misgivings always came through they always had a close and friendly relationship and after the emperor was overthrown pasteur refused to say a bad word about him grateful to the end of his life br br the part about his daughter having the baby and pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor never happened the part about the anthrax and rabies for which he was famous is generally correct but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false he was famous and respected at the time this happened this movie is ok from a dramatic standpoint but very distorted as biography
<START> i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old i was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily the end result however was underwhelming br br i was aware of the emma peel diana prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form however there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie the final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero br br i saw the movie again in my late teen years it hadn't improved much cathy lee crosby was more familiar thanks to that's incredible but her acting was no better the script had a few good ideas like the rogue amazon and a decent villain in ricardo montalban but it just didn't come together and was still boring br br i think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax it was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book the amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expanded br br the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget the budget was also pretty low here and superheroes don't come cheap br br it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd if only as a comparison and historical document even superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except chris reeve and gene hackman it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions
<START> it's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of notoriety despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good br br overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer the child renying zhou is beautiful and downright strong and withstands the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine yet this film can't stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best br br my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it should've been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended
<START> i am currently on vacation in israel for summer and so was able to see this incredible film a bit of a warning before i begin writing i speak fluent hebrew and so the hebrew parts were no problem however about a quarter a bit less of the film is in arabic and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit this did not detract from my understanding of the film but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater br br after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest yet the bubble surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting witty dialogue and relevant political climate br br the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli palestinian border for the first few moments we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on yet this is an important element of this film's strength the political situation and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background most importantly tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film it is constantly referenced street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam ohad knoller and a palestinian immigrant ashraf yousef 'joe' sweid with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil we always know that their relationship is forbidden and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema the love is incredibly strong and stands as the centerpiece of the film the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's yousef 'joe' sweid relationship with the ultra butch and grating golani solider golan zohar liba is particularly a source of amusement the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite fine crafted works of art and the cinematography is astounding in the first love scene of the film the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu daniela virtzer and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love br br to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue even when watching this movie in my second language i could not stop laughing throughout lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema the music used in the film is also particularly powerful music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other little elements like this truly elevate the film br br i could not give greater recommendation to a film this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted
<START> i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves waves that are monstrously huge waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves there is nothing special about the film other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk sure there are scenes of them surfing but what makes this movie so special is the people here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film see it
<START> with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i've started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mj's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay br br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him br br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mj's music br br lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene br br bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention i've gave this subject hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter
<START> domino is a great movie it's about a young woman names domino harvey kiera knightley who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle she joins with two fellow hunters mickey rourke edgar ramirez and the adventures begin the script is good very down to earth and realistic with the tone of the film the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do instead of the character of domino br br even with that kiera knightley gives a fierce performance she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance mickey rourke follows up his oscar worthy performance in 'sin city' with another tough guy performance edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance mo'nique was herself although she did surprise me on one particular scene lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her br br the best thing about the movie though is the direction tony scott's fast paced style really brings the movie to life the cinematography is some of the best i've ever seen it takes a regular movie and puts on acid all the blacks are blacker the whites are brighter and it has a sort of green glow to it the action scenes are exhilarating br br overall if you liked sin city man on fire you'll like domino
<START> i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support vic morrow as the villain is superb br br when sheen tests the water in his '34 ford cool along the mountainous highway it is spectacular br br the ending is grand br br i'm disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days br br good taste eludes the masses
<START> very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has thank god it was temporary but uc is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you're flipping channels at 3 00am you just can't take your eyes off my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that's beside the point i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers and if you didnt know how to two step you were considered a social moron personally i think it's a great movie travolta really surprised me on the heels of satnitefever who'd a thunk he's actually believable too the soundtrack is awesome too bad charlene tilton of tv's dallas fame ruined johnny lee's career cause that guy was just terrific the show stealer here is scott glenn as the greaser ex con redneck cowboy and i ain't got nothing against greaser ex con cowboys semi being one myself but i've always envied what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time pack at s t sort of like clint's make my day and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i'll see to my julia roberts fantasy so like i said beautiful 9 10
<START> how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jackson's book which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based i suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywood's current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love it br br things i did not like about this adaption br br 1 it was not a true adaption of the book from the articles i had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining i didn't like that either what the movie's press release should have said is we got the basic very basic idea from shirley jackson's book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading character's names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in a bit of them too br br 2 they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear like lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day br br 3 in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and this time around nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of the changeling the only problem was the so called mystery was so incoherently told that i'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience but then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with it's first victim died before ever setting eyes on it br br 4 the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of it's history and in this one he was just a winey voiced bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep insomnia remember and was a compulsive liar br br 5 i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with nel's sister's family and mrs dudley's little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting it's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do br br 6 i missed nel's narrative through the whole movie the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through nel's eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine the original nel was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching ghost one too many times br br 7 they changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much there was no abigail crain the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh crain's wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much i don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should be sorry if ya get my drift the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with br br in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie this 'movie' should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one
<START> this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living br br some of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie br br some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in colour the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that br br watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
<START> sunshine is a european import set in hungary between 1880 and 1980 it's the epic story of hungarian jews the sonnenschein family this name literally translates to sunshine the family has humble beginnings then is prosperous becomes upwardly mobile changes it's name and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ralph fiennes plays these three roles for those who missed the ww ii and the holocaust in europe the sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well br br sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success but it is an opportunity missed the story line dominated by world history is predictable and transparent this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage the family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event ie the hapsburgs ww i ww ii fascism communism etc to the next with little continuity depth or detail the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused and important sub themes the 'secret' diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end alternatively the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest infidelity br br ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material the 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater sunshine is basically hungarian history channel material it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex br br
<START> loved the movie loved the two families crossing paths in history only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children hmmmmmmmmm never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit even with the mistakes in the movie just loved it the acting was great not sure where the story was with mr sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier the other counseler did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up
<START> yesterday i attended the world premiere of descent at the tribeca film festival in nyc i had a great time it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my spacer marcus patrick br br i give the movie 7 5 starts out of a possible 10 stars br br the movie begins with maya rosario dawson at college you can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on the photography in this film was excellent she meets jared chad faust and they become sweethearts it appears like any other relationship in the beginning the man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get both played this well very innocent flirtation between the two he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart br br the apartment is very dreary and dark they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles this actually reminded me of a dungeon here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her this is a very dark and gritty rape scene this scene is not for the young or weak at heart the rape scene is a little long and hard to take but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows br br maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex she falls into her own abyss she starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there she is told to go see adrian marcus patrick the first thing i remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving he is actually the one who introduces maya to drugs they begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience br br maya is then back in college as a ta and who is in her class jared her rapist you could see the confusion and emotion on maya's face what should i do what do i do next the shots of her face and the emotions are priceless br br what unfolds next is not actually whats happening she acts interested in jared she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again i was sitting there saying could this really be happening it wasn't nothing could be farther from the truth br br she invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up now her apartment is dark and gritty she has him strip down completely he thinks he's going to get lucky she then teases him like any woman can she's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited note for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity may not be right for the younger viewer br br she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him once again the scene is dark gritty and very rough br br if you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph br br this is where adrian reenters the picture maya has adrian save her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared she thinks this is the final revenge adrian continues to take all of jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing marcus as adrian plays this scene as believable as anyone can he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen after the movie during a q a session marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and chad maya believes that this revenge will save her but i don't think it does one of the final scenes has a closeup of mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek this was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie did she get the revenge she wanted was it as satisfying as she expected in my opinion it does not it only makes matters worse br br this is an excellent movie will well acted roles and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it i would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age rosario chad and marcus should be commended for jobs well done the directing and photography must also be commended it was a night that i enjoyed
<START> okay this is gona be short and sweet review something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was br br this movie is there's a good reason there was a petition with over 40 000 signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked blood rayne being a biggie there br br the jokes are good if you've never heard them a thousand times before the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that i even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script br br the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games hello if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular there's way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said i wouldn't even steal this movie and for the person who says this is ' funniest movie of 2007' need to take a look around the news is better than this
<START> this movie was one of the best disney movies i've ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far fetched but it's a feel good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy j p and academy award winner adrien brody's part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended
<START> as this movie is completely in swiss dialect it's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie i'm not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings i've seen a lot of movies of this kind eg scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind i've seen so far i give a 9 of 10 the only reason i can't give a 10 is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd so there's almost no chance for non swiss to understand
<START> gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish every single episode is a joy to watch the story is typical gundam fare in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government known as the earth sphere alliance is violently taking over the free colonies to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz which later takes control of earth and the colonies select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come these mechs known as gundams fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front stage completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies br br gundam wing as i previously stated is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle now don't get me wrong this show still has many epic battles within it and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1 br br no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime or sci fi in general the show sports some amazing animation and superb action but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed br br a perfect 10 10
