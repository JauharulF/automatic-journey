<START> if this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry yash raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards br br if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations br br the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil kapoor's gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie br br in short it's the biggest waste of resourses after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this br br one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay's love story after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar br br regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location probably ladakh in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car i am still thinking who wrote this br br if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan br br dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both
<START> really does any week go by that oprah doesn't remind us that she was abused as child br br she makes herself the focus of every interview br br oprah cannot resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks she often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest's faces because that's what counts what oprah feels what oprah says br br oprah oprah oprah it's always all about oprah br br oprah says feel sorry for me i was so poor feel the pain of my battle with my weight feel my hurt when i'm turned away from a fancy store after they've already closed feel good for buying my magazines and books feel good for my success feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good feel good for making me rich beyond belief br br my interpretation of her point of view you viewers are all deeply flawed and you need my daily advice i have all the answers for your life though i have nothing in common with you plebes i have never been married nor do i want to be i have never had to raise a family but i know all about it i have little respect for men or marriage i clearly prefer people like me over others witness legends ball 2006 gayle is my best friend but we are not gay br br as of 7 31 2006 the heading on her website actually reads oprah com is your leading source for information about love life self relationships food home spirit and health how presumptive and obnoxious is that br br in june 2006 she crashed two private wedding receptions in oklahoma to gather footage for her september 2006 shows she keeps promising to quit tv but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight br br contrary to what she thinks oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from god she's just one very lucky overweight black woman who copied phil donahue's style and called it her own she happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic br br oprah is the p t barnum of this age and it amazes me that people cannot see through her facade br br so ladies and gentlemen boys and girls and you too oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door this way now to the great egress
<START> there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting br br the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so far br br everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
<START> notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book br br i don't understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about 120 minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as well as the imagination i don't care if a film is as good as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it is br br this tv movie was charming an old and oft seen story prone to clichÃ© it could easily have been embarrassing however riffen and reeves pull it off one reviewer found riffen far to old i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23 24 year old amazingly well i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used tightening nonetheless it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story but rather a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil and it is nice to see a love story without the obligatory f word the naked buttocks or hours of spit swapping kissing br br lastly the musical score is excellent
<START> this isn't a film it's a 111 minute evangelical christian sermon draped over red state america's 1 sport high school football another of the long earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours br br dialogue like you won the big one when you accepted christ loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director coach alex kendrick's sunken black eyes then there are the parables br br two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it which one do you think god blessed this rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax in the course of which coach asks his trepidous back up kicker son do you think god could help you make that kick it's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith based funding ad infinitum if only the evangelical christian bush administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become devout after their example behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale urging his team on crying who's with me while the devout eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the lord's work br br so do you think our terrified back up makes his kick to vanquish those self centrist goliaths well we all know zealots can't lose put it this way transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the middle east replace the christian proselytizing and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a taliban vs superpower parable which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute br br luckily they won't care nor need to like coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame the answers are all right here in this book and the christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture that final victory they have prepared their fields for
<START> if this movie had not been labeled a disney picture i probably would not have been so disappointed the nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything the same can be said for the toilet bowl scene this is one disney film that i will not let my four year old nephew watch
<START> you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest then this movie is for you it truly was like a porn without the sex or if that analogy is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench this is the movie that you would make horrible acting bad camera work music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all and more for those who are masochists in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection br br all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who 'starred' in it br br their movie career is over before it started
<START> this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but he's no less sure footed as director or actor he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also love and romance are not the director's priorities here but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action and insure that viewers don't hit the fast forward button between the physical clashes br br the opening scene which features a funny light sabre duel sets a solid but deceptive tone a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp comic tone the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type the film's violence escalates slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production the director actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bone cracking physically punishing delight br br terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made br br great score too
<START> david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie nandjiwarra amagula uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock sized hail during bright blue skies with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is split into groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chris david gulpilil appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it's quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come br br absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film's most compelling angle is certainly david's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later
<START> to quote flik that was my reaction exactly wow you're perfect this is the best movie i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever even wow i tell you what wow

<START> a lovely old fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch red rock west follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out and he might be broke but he will not steal not even in his present dire circumstances consequently when he is mistaken by mr j t walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions in turn she in the person of miss l f boyle offers him even more money to murder mr walsh mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road tempted as he might be to drive on he takes the man to hospital where it turns out he has been shot mr cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j t walsh events take a further complicated turn when escaping from custody mr cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit man on his way to fulfill his commission about now you might be forgiven for thinking enough already but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable mr d hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer like mr cage a usmc veteran this little piece of serendipity keeps mr cage alive long enough out think the murderous trio and survive a little more battered but still unbowed it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round red rock west is a movie lover's movie within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions but you'll be very happy during the trip
<START> red rock west was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script by john and rick dahl that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and especially j t walsh in a memorable performance making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed the film never had much publicity on release in fact i first caught up with it on tv and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following br br nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered 10 000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown the excellent j t walsh he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne lara flynn boyle but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists turns and surprises and double dealings that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow br br some favourite lines from the film br br nicolas cage to lara flynn boyle i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money br br j t walsh to cage michael williams well michael you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this br br boyle to cage you're not a killer cage that's right no but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here br br boyle to cage o k how you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking 10 000 from my husband br br an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller just 98 minutes with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals any film featuring j t walsh is o k in my book and red rock west was one of his best how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998 the most prolific period for film noir was without any doubt the forties but red rock west is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my top ten list of all time favourite films i look forward to more like this from director john dahl 10 10 clive roberts br br
<START> i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt the episode where starsky kill starsky almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there just got to say happy birthday paul
<START> eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show i love his impressions of mr t ed norton and ralph cramden of the honeymooners elvis presley and michael jackson too the ice cream man goony goo goo is also funny i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984 i laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair i still think this is very funny br br eddie murphy when he was on saturday night live made me laugh so hard he is one of the best people to come out of saturday night live eddie murphy delirious is his best stand up performance next to eddie murphy raw br br i give eddie murphy delirious 2 thumbs up and 10 10 stars
<START> i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up br br and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it br br thank you
<START> this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war pow camp stalag luft iii during the second world war this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re captured officers by the gestapo and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name br br while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels known as tom dick harry two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap frog in the compound br br initially containing one and later with two pows hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire under the wire and into the woods br br the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape made with far less a budget than the great escape the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape br br the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees eric williams and is by far the best pow escape story ever made into a movie some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii i give this movie a well deserved ten
<START> ok so it's a low budget film i used the quotes because it was shot in hi 8 video the acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from sherwin williams and i've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors br br i might be able to forgive these low budget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot no real characters and no momentum it's a self indulgent mess br br and don't worry no spoilers here 'cause there's absolutely nothing to spoil
<START> i am currently doing film studies at a s level and this is not a love song is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back story if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers after committing a murder sounds quite exiting br br however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre as it is suggested it is a love story between two homosexual lovers filled with trust deceit and betrayal we are not told about this love directly through the film but the events that happen through out for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces br br overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as rubbish just because they are done on a low budget br br a good film with an intricate story line however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters
