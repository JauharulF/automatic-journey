<START> i like the time period i like the attempt but watching a movie that looks like i'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus i would upgrade my computer could be that this was the look the director was after but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes if i hadn't taken someone with me to this film i was out of there even though it was a series and not a movie per say band of brothers accomplished this they made it look like wwii footage with just a touch of graininess but it was still a pleasure to watch movies need real people with real sets and real locations use cgi when it is appropriate not for an entire film
<START> a warm sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop james stewart and margaret sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it the key to this film's success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low key unfussy performances as a result you fall in love with virtually all of them br br there's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated loneliness is a major theme most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager played wonderfully by frank morgan he discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant because they're both reaching out to this unseen other who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met of course we know everything will turn out right in the end but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy br br lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family and that's exactly how it feels to us as well br br this is a wonderful unsung romance br br grade a
<START> i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films br br this is not a bad movie it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns i don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment br br what makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong beautiful women two of which are black one asian and a mexican hispanic character br br these aren't your usual western women they're tough they can draw fast and shoot straight br br they're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey br br the plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns in the vein of you shot my brother so i'm gonna get you only in this western a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it br br so she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days br br one of them maria is not really all that interested in avenging rachel's sister but she is motived by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed br br there are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense not that they interfere that much they can be ignored but i wondered why they were there so the film could use a little tightening but over all this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is br br my only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain of the heroines one is obviously straight the others sexual orientations are never disclosed br br 7 stars
<START> the dukes of hazzard is quite an achievement Â a 53m film that's worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25 year old tv show the plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious johnny knoxville is more passenger than protagonist m c gainey's sheriff roscoe is a bland thug michael weston's enos tiresome a seemingly ideally cast willie nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and burt reynolds stuck in some purgatory where he's doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player is a curious choice for boss hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill you know a film is in trouble when seann william scott and jessica simpson are the most charismatic screen presencesÂ but worse than the script or the casting is jay chandrasekhar's hopeless direction seemingly born with no conception of comic timing unable to do much more than basic two shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise there are a couple of neat post modern moments revolving around the confederate flag and daisy's stereotypical role in every episode but no film that makes you pine for the days when hal needham was directing this sort of thing and badly can be a good thing
<START> this is a movie that gets better each time i see it there are so many nuanced performances in this william tracey as pepi is a delight bringing sharp comic relief joseph schildkraut as vadas is the only villian in the movie and his oily charms are well used here frank morgan is delightful as the owner of the title shop mr matuschek and his familiar manner is well used here i especially liked the performance of felix bressart as pirovitch very believable in every facet of his role br br the two leads are equally accomplished with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet charming and attractive woman br br this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though the movie is presented from his point of view with the action rotating around him mr stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions just watch stewart when he is fired from his job because of a misunderstanding he is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so perfectly in my estimation james stewart is without question the greatest film actor in the history of the medium there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience at the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft this is one of jimmy stewarts best movies and also one of the sweetest most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find i greatly recommend this movie especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart
<START> this is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings as it is unavailable on video dvd the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving although quite a lot happens in between and they don't stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world if you get a chance to see this film then do i can't wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release
<START> i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end however when i saw the movie i was very disappointed first of all no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24 25 the late christopher reeve was also miscast same reason will according to the book was around 30 i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life his friend red elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady i know the movie didn't have the budget of the bridges of madison county which i believe was released around the same time br br but to me this was a very poorly made low budget miscast movie as someone mentioned i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be she knows her characters better than anyone i hope that she would consider doing the casting too the movie let me down
<START> living in the middle east in israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don't care save your money save your time choose another movie br br robi chernitsky
<START> what's inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it's a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i've rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it's a movie yes capital m there it's an epic it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times br br but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn't exactly dumb but it's not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn't cry when bambi's mom died i don't react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you'll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 1 8 billion dollars worldwide it can't be bad not possible 10 10 br br p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 9 11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn't anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered
<START> generally i am not a huge fan of stop motion films and at first ruka didn't capture my attention however knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the soviet domination era the more i watched the film the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement br br the sad little film is done without any dialog but it's pretty clear what is happening a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot making it into a sculpture of a hand instead well the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing however over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man and by the end the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand in a sign of real hypocrisy gives the man a hero's funeral br br as i said this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jirÃ­ trnka to criticize his domineering government not surprisingly though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise the state i e the hand banned this little parable sadly trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co called velvet revolution
<START> i'm sure that the folks on the texas louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war no big cattle empires there they're much farther west in texas farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire br br the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle they keep the cattle and that's the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start br br along the way foster marries dix's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo br br anyway us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount the climax is a blazing and i mean that literally gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production br br but i wouldn't have any but western fans look at it
<START> talk about your waste of money im just wondering why michael would star in such a turkey of a movie michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer that was wonderful as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up michael is such a talented actor so what made him do this one i watched it and thought it was really dumb i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies especially the squeeze i didnt understand that one at all and i feel his best performance was in pacific heights his character really creeped me out and i really enjoyed multiplicity that one was so hilarious and he was just perfect for the role of batman and i kind of liked night shift and i love johnny dangerously too just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies like this one was
<START> my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun ha ha like spielberg did it's like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo's investigation as many later episodes would do
<START> well here comes another well romantic comedy but unlike all others movies of this genre this is by far the best i have seen in a long while br br i'll admit at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox and a little because of simon pegg br br first of all if you have watched a decent amount of movies you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie one way or another but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how br br okay now this movie is just made for simon pegg i can't see any other actor in the role of sidney and i'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg's great performance br br there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard courtesy of simon pegg's character sidney but i think everyone in this movie is good for example kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie i usually don't think of her as any more than an average actress but she was really good in this one then there's jeff bridges there's gillian anderson and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes great role for her br br all in all while i usually don't agree with ratings her on imdb this time i would completely agree with them br br go and see this movie it is really light hearted and positive and i recommend it deeply my rating 7 out of 10 well 7 5 actually
<START> an ultra nervous old man mr goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier of course it's the stooges who couldn't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up some detectives the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monster type goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr goodrich br br some of the gags like moe and larry's wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with mr goodrich's niece in a classic routine with a long accordion like camera lens the act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny too shemp was so good that i didn't mind he was taking the great curly's place br br larry moe curly shemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house that's the last six minutes in here at times such as this film
<START> i am a huge jane austen fan and i ordered the movie from amazon uk just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the u s i really should have saved my money what is with anne running after wentworth the whole point of anne elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined she is not impulsive and vulgar and mary was she suffering from a stroke or something her speech wasn't normal nor was her walking normal there was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole romance completely unbelievable in the final scene they even have sally hawkins wearing the same dress amanda root wore during the letter scene the same clothes do not make it the same movie in my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version which even though it had it's flaws it did stay pretty close to the book the book i don't even think they read it this is kind of like a cliff's notes movie of persuasion hit on all the high points without explaining anything
<START> ok i love bad horror i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of demonicus or house of the dead those were bad enough to make fun of severed was not br br it was worse br br spoilers who cares br br my friend and i sat through the entire film and i have a number of comments both in the this sucks style and in the realm of actual critiques br br plot sort of there's a guy in this city which is possibly seattle see comment below who is running around and cutting off heads he's been doing this for over a year i'm not going back to get exact numbers thank you very much possibly two or three years one head a week and the police are just now calling in a specialist who once refers to himself as a psychic but that never comes up again br br schya right feds take over after what three connected homicides after nearly a hundred similar killings we'd be under freaking martial law br br anyway this specialist consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's baron samedi a voodoo spirit who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world or possibly just go to disneyland br br um br br setting where is this happening well if you're not from seattle you might not realize that at the bar rave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members there's a poster for a local radio station and that in the highly entertaining pulp fiction esqe dialog as if between the two cops yes the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was made br br being from seattle i apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame br br ok here's where it gets really critical being a horror movie writer not published don't go looking for my name in the imdb i do research lots of research and unlike the writers of this movie i know that baron samedi while a voudon loa spirit who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated by various christian oppressors with satan is actually a loki like trickster god br br in other words he doesn't cut off heads br br besides a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa br br not to mention if he's already possessed someone why make a new body br br also if baron samedi got a body he wouldn't go around cutting off heads he'd get some good rum and cigars and par tay br br in summary the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do again i've done research anyone remember the old late night ad for phone in tarot readings the lovers you will soon fall madly in love and all that nonsense br br if you made it this far through my comments i congratulate you and i'm sorry again i'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me so please don't
<START> this project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular japanese manga slamdunk and that's not something new to jay chou who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga initial d along the way it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie so hence the title even if the idea wasn't very original with stephen chow's shaolin soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined br br however and thankfully those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum and in kung fu dunk really quite unnecessary because they don't add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when stephen chow used kung fu in football games jay chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist fang shi jie since it's not the first time he fought using martial arts curse of the golden flower anyone and under the stunt direction of ching siu tung he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer just to let you know who's boss br br that was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle and with eric tsang as a small time hustler chen li who sees his potential and becomes his agent he joins a university to play varsity basketball but not without the initial objection of team captain ting wei chen bo lin and team star xiao lan baron chen in his big screen debut but you know with team members on the same side it's not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court br br and i will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how goal was to football it made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts here special effects and wire work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the nba league and in all honesty really looked stunning especially when they mimic various dunking moves and performing combo moves thanks to technology and stunt work so in actuality the kung fu elements don't really have to be in the movie the stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they're quite grounded to reality only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk br br pity too that the number of games were only a handful with the time spent on plenty of subplots but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please things like the abandoned shi jie's quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games and his love life with charlene choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else everyone's acting a little too cool leaving little room for main characters to add depth one of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court than only on it and during competitive games apart from the high fives and friendly passes br br with the us 10 million budget it is easy to see where the money went to the effects in particular a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie it's quite flawless nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone but again i like to emphasize that even without those elements the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves and having jay chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success
<START> what a disappointment br br this film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack black's acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this mistake br br we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first br br was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel
<START> my daughter gets really put out at me when i refer to drew barrymore as looking as if she'd been hit in the face with a frying pan not to mention her dudley dooright chin that jay leno would die for how wonderful then when i discovered in fever pitch that i really like miss barrymore and jimmy fallon and the red sox and boston this film is probably best characterized as a sweet light comedy to be absolutely stereotypical the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and jimmy fallon's vulnerability and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania br br my sports hating wife my teenage daughter and i all found something to like in the film that says something in itself it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so and is probably a really good date flic too
