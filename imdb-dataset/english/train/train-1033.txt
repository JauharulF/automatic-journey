<START> i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed the area is called parati and is part of the green coast of the rio de janeiro state it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro city br br this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade all the while negotiating with the natives who also fought each other for whatever reasons br br one french misfit a mercenary is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all naked native tribe while he is a slave of the chief according to the customs of the tribe he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge br br what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives' villages and their way of life they walked naked and were cannibals and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was in a gorgeous garden of eden life was messy violent full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs the europeans arrive and bring their own problems including more violence with better weapons and greed there is no romanticized noble savages or heroic explorers here it is just people trying to survive in a tough world br br the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives from what i know of the subject the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans
<START> from the mind of harry alan towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge supposedly based on the work of h rider haggard the only similarity it bears to anything haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in africa albeit an africa that has dinosaurs which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes and has some characters with the same names br br our heroes david mccallum patrick mcnee and john colico set out to seek treasure armed only with a medallion and end up precisely where the treasure is purely by chance on the way they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters pick up a french chef and mccallum has an affair with the queen of phoenicia br br it's so ridiculous it's a hoot that's the only reason i didn't give it a 1
<START> my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti social goth this was probably why my shirt was soaked because i've experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling i too would not have sought out this movie but i'm sure glad i saw it very moving very touching great for those who love a good drama or tear jerker
<START> these days spielberg's the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch what's even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for best director needless to say the film makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded br br the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson whoopi goldberg an african american woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celie's relationships with the women around her it's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick' br br the story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but i didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes br br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg best actress oprah winfrey best supporting actress and margaret avery best supporting actress i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffed br br as already mentioned spielberg didn't receive a best director nomination for his efforts such an omission beggars belief since spielberg's direction here is top notch i'm not especially crazy about quincy jones's score but it's not below average by any means br br in the end the story is a satisfying one well told by a master film maker working from pulitzer prize winning material give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
<START> it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art br br it is however a beautiful movie i have loved it since local channels used to show it graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories many love the fallen idol but i am not among them i think i saw brighton rock once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel this is superbly cast charles boyer does not it's true come across as spanish but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character tired wary caring lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him but the supporting players are the best katina paxinou is excellent her performance is a little grand guignol but i attribute that to the director peter lorre whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto like universal language is excellent as always br br and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart she comes across as a precocious early teenager the character wants to be helpful she does her best br br i recommend this movie highly not without reservations the reservation is primarily that it is a little stolid but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered
<START> nicely done and along with new voyages it's a great continuation fab to see james cawley in the latest episode vigil check it out br br i like the growing characterisation and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan produced piece this show manages to capture the feel quite well as they state on the ste it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience a strong script editor and a pick up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is br br good work to all concerned br br i have a huge soft spot for lefler mcfarland great acting although i'm a bit tired of lefler's laws enough already shelby's great if a little uptight and it's cool she got the ship commodore ian's nice like fred flintstone but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself the doc counselor and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes as is the wonderful nechayev what a beautiful accent a real russian well i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep br br it gets my vote and the cgi is kewl some of the greenscreen's obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo br br really glad i found it br br ok some of the acting isn't great but it's fan made and is therefore allowed to be variable sorry cmm cole br br the gay material is layed on too thick graham norton'd be embarrassed trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent i hope they tone it down let aster zen be people not tokens i don't treat my gay friends any differently they're just regular guys br br musically it's a mixed bag i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time but timing can fall flat now then the end of worst fears part 2 misses the crunch and the edit love the fact they use the galaxy quest music br br i certainly can't wait for more dazza br br never give up never surender br br viva les frontieres
<START> this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained sure some things are simplified but most of it was correct even though it was made 22 years ago and quite understandable i would suggest that all soon to be medical student should watch it it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example now i'm in my 7th semester and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd box
<START> i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out this one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a b that he normally gives it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role all in all a highly recommended film
<START> forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars slot comfortably into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyage br br briefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ship's owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the day br br this is a production that plumbs new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the so called plot are breath takingly poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings br br yes it's that bad br br i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film however its dumber than dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i mean br br imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard what would you do i don't know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's lives
<START> there are several things wrong with this movie brenda song's character being one of them i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor i honestly don't i believe she is given poor lines she is just supposed to be that vain rich girl and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in it can't even get a dry laugh from me here br br either way i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this film br br the movie was not that terrible initially wendy's reaction to shen was completely natural i mean how would you feel if a man claiming to be a reincarnated monk chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight the great evil and save the world which brings me to another point i know this movie is entirely fiction but it is still has a founding in chinese culture it seems like all of the warriors in wendy's family line were women correct me if i'm wrong but i doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that sure maybe they could've worked it in somehow but they offered no explanation whatsoever by doing so they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the media br br nevermind that however let us continue br br wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on yes she is a teenager and it is near homecoming i mean who wants to fight evil during homecoming the problem is when the evil starts to manifest himself wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be she is extremely careless even for someone like her she continues not to care about her training i will use this conversation as an example shen if you do not win this battle evil will take over and everything good will be gone wendy whoa talk about pressure well let's talk about something else yes let's wendy let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training of course shen lets her but his character has an excuse better that he cooperate with her than that he not and she not train at all and get them both killed br br oh speaking of which shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle as he had for her great grandmother i am assuming that part br br this makes wendy's actions more unforgivable br br as the script writer would have it wendy's homecoming and this great battle are on exactly the same day do you know what wendy does do you even have to guess yes she does end up going to the battle for when she tries to leave for homecoming the monks who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she felt weird fighting an old man inform her that shen has gone to battle alone so she goes to save him br br we initially see some half decent fighting that is actually entertaining until finally the great evil comes out of wendy's rival for homecoming's body and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors br br don't ask br br anyway wendy gets all panicky then shen goes and defends her from this guy forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name and manages to get himself killed br br wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air br br she screams title of said article out br br now it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far far too fast no i will not let it be excused because it was her destiny and she had the power within her br br since when though did she learn healing no worst since when could she resurrect people so shen is raised from the dead then wendy and he fight the guy br br he loses way to easily the worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is banished forever then the monks commend wendy on her sacrifice br br two things 1 don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more finesse to it 2 what sacrifice the fact that she didn't go to homecoming because the girl did not break a sweat or even bleed i mean come on now this movie was tv pg i wanted to see somebody get hurt br br ah hem moving on br br i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one based on my comments part of critique you must know though is breaking a thing down you don't necessarily try to look for the bad but if it's there you bring attention to it this movie has a lot of bad but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place br br so i suppose it was all right not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it
<START> i've given 'kÃ´hÃ® jikÃ´' a low score not because it was a bad movie but because it doesn't do anything worth praising br br i've not seen any of hsiao hsien hou's work before but for the uninitiated me included 'kÃ´hÃ® jikÃ´' is advertised as a homage to yasujiro ozu a japanese director whose last film was way way in 1962 the film is an extremely sparse work containing very little dialogue story music or emotion br br yo hitoto plays 'yoko' a jobless wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a taiwanese composer she likes tadanobu asano plays her friend who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains and that's about all it br br we watch as yoko drinks coffee alone walks around waits for a train catches a train falls asleep on the train the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch
<START> i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it i am ready to watch it again br br i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites br br of course the martial arts are stunning there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style however if you are not we paused playback briefly and walker texas ranger was on we noticed that after every strike there was a cut not in black mask br br
<START> bad movie itÂ´s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown ups i just saw it because iÂ´m a robin williams fan and i was very disappointed
<START> happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable br br i can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family i'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad br br amateur in the extreme br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> good action show but nothing new this one took place high in the mountains which showed some nice scenery and such one man takes on a group of mercenaries the lead flies and he kicks butt it could have been called rambo goes to the rockies it was that pat it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror not a bad picture but just same ol' same ol'
<START> sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness i remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re release of the excorcistÂ really nervous laughter it punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of satan coming out of a 12 year old girl in the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic the wicker man however it made me think that this new wickerman is about as scary as the south park character scuzzlebut the friendly forest monster with tv's patrick duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets br br 3 years ago a friend of mine in hollywood told me that he heard that nicolas cage was going to do a remake of the film i started laughing and my friend keith got mad at me touting nicolas cage as a great actor i just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers i was right gone is the realness the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue instead we have horror movie clichÃ©s affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart like many of the countless hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground playing wickerman br br the original film takes place on a remote scottish isle where a scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named rowan morrison in the new spin a california cop cage is lured to an island of the coast of washington state by his ex girlfriend to find her missing daughter she sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago the crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his ex girlfriend find her daughter he arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of wiccans many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in the village and like the village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison br br i think that the opportunity in hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry i think someone like nicolas cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks we needed a bad re make of the wickerman like we needed yet another '9 11' movie i'm starting to wonder if nicolas changed his surname from coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so
<START> i'm certainly glad that a film was made about carl brashear's amazing life story coming as it did during the civil rights era brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected br br brashear as played by cuba gooding jr leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct as brashear gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father carl lumbly has and lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten br br but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii the navy still has its restrictions a black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet the real fighting parts are denied him that's not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver br br once at the diving school at bayonne new jersey gooding gets it all thrown at him mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge robert deniro deniro may have some leftover prejudices but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide br br the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding they certainly come from different places but as they get to know each other both turn out to be men of honor br br other good performances to note are charlize theron as deniro's wife and hal holbrook as the head of the diving school a guy the navy just wish would retire for reasons you'll see br br men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change
<START> i've noticed that a lot of people who post on the kerching board seem to hate this show which i actually find very surprising i think it's one of the best british kids' shows there is it's a shame it's ending because it's very funny if a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters the main character is a little like del boy although quite a lot smarter with his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of rudeboy his friends are seymour who likes to cook and danny who is simple minded and the comic relief character throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but it's always been entertaining and improving
<START> this movie is beautifully designed there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission br br paxton is at his best in this role his mannerisms the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue each shot meticulously done surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but it's a gem that has been very well polished it's not for the simple mind
<START> i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick i was wrong br br pandora's clock is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen br br the cast is excellent including veteran actors richard dean anderson edward herrmann robert guillaume and robert loggia daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia and frasier's jane leeves is also very good br br the dialogue is well written and the story is compelling throughout in fact the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second if you get a chance to see this movie invest the time nearly four hours you will be richly rewarded
