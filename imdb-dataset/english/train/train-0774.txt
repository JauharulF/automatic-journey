<START> i saw the movie recently and really liked it i surprised myself and cried this movie is in the same niche genre as away from her or even the bucket list but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar the director does a masterful job with the challenge hagar's hard to understand her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all br br the first scene gets this across without any compromise hagar ellen burnstyn is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter in law she figures it out en route and freaks out her edges are really hard she is mean she is belittling and selfish she is a stone i didn't like her not even a little bit br br throughout the course of the movie we get insight we find out why she doesn't like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character i started to see the angel and i started to like her i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack ellen burnstyn you are a brilliant actor kudos kudos kudos what a scene br br this isn't a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect they are there for a reason br br hagar isn't my mother she isn't even my mother in law or neighbor but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel
<START> this movie was an attempt to go into places most don't and perhaps shouldn't venture into it was a similar trial at the bizarre head case perspective given to us in the cell although not near as in depth and well portrayed the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it then as the movie takes its supposed dramatic turn the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place br br basically the idea is that of a kid chris mckenna who needs money he takes on the role of a hit man killing a city accountant then he doesn't get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the brilliant idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused he begins to go crazy some very disturbing scenes then thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over he visits the wife kari wuhrer of the man who he killed and wins her affections soon after she discovers who he is tragedy strikes and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers daniel baldwin george wendt vernon wells for their previous kindness br br i got to ask though what is it with kari wuhrer and horror gore type films br br it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre granted i liked her in eight legged freaks and she was okay in anaconda but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure wow she's hot she can act much better and chose better roles or maybe i'm wrong and that is just a misconception for all you guys out there you get to see the fully monty of her in this film although it's rather bizarre and short lived i almost felt like she did some soft porn after watching this film something not foreign to kari's career the sex simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming br br anyway i will say there is some good acting just don't expect much of it from daniel balwin whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alex's the film did bring out a few old greats though george wendt norm from cheers and vernon wells commando weird science above all chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character sean crawley his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth bring some elements of substance to the film br br i wouldn't go out of my way for this one if you're bored and are tired of the same old episodes of the hitchhiker then i might advise watching this br br and kari please start acting in some better films
<START> i think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good when you look at the trailer park livin' dollar whiskey drinkin' incest lovin' people on the springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful he ditched a political career to host the show just for us br br what we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie ringmaster ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think the movie follows the pre requisite springer story line love triangles one triangle involves connie her daughter angel and her husband rusty the other involves starletta vonda and demond when the two hapless groups meet up in la their lives intertwine and collide head on all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show it's like what short cuts would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habit br br ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish it also makes me very glad that i don't live in the squalor it's characters do but the movie has a problem it's billed as a comedy but it just isn't very funny what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh non stop if you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then i guess you're one of those folks personally i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white trash life br br the jerry springer show just isn't meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen what's funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie movies have to tell a story and that's something else ringmaster has trouble with the story is threadbare there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder and even if there weren't such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story even the hollywood formula couldn't make this better ringmaster is so bad it even screws up the best part of the springer show the final thought somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around br br the worst offender in all of this is springer himself he's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly watching springer play springer is sad it's like he was going for a 'what if woody allen played jerry springer' vibe and he failed miserably he went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much better br br not that i'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance just the opposite they all suck not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness the best any of them was did was molly hagan landing a job on a nickelodeon sitcom apparently nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts br br here are my final thoughts what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain damaged lumps of goo i say no somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us we just have to keep looking for it until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones and don't ever watch ringmaster
<START> princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism in the way we think of racism in the united states but there are more subtle to the american viewer assertions about ethnic identity during the time pay attention to alwina's baker placement within shots how she is addressed by the other characters the settings around her that all depict her as a savage african and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film i don't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention the dichotomy between eastern and western culture is to say the least offensive such diction is thankfully disavowed these days the french have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted see chris marker's les statues meurent aussi 1953 and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the other i give this film a 7 because i am a sucker for baker much of what she did in her professional career like princes tam tam that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration her work as a freaking spy i am gushing sorry however the film for me is captivating because of her performance besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities
<START> it's a rather good movie but too americanised in it's predictability change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one and you get to watch bend it like beckham 2002 almost scene for scene a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself as the kung fu master stressed several times on a different level the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion actually the majority of the danish citizenry the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark

<START> we do not come across movies on brother sister relationship in indian cinema or any other language or medium this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels typically a sister is depicted as a pile on who can be used for ransom in the climax this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light br br it is inspired by george eliot's novel the mill on the floss the brother is very prosaic all good the blue eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother the sister is romantic wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society in spite of this the love of the brother sister is the winner br br this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world br br although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true
<START> a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensuality br br one other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
<START> anna charlotte burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation a bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it's inhabitant marc who can't walk because anna didn't draw him any legs are inhabitants of this purgatory limbo world anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and marc there forever br br wow is a good word to sum up bernard rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic paperhouse a film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget while you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but it's more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it's cast in particular charlotte burke and elliot speirs marc and yet it's not a children's movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination there's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it's very own sense of reasoning as the story unfolded i was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye br br bernard rose's visuals are brilliant here he's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts the acting is of young charlotte burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well unfortunately she's not graced the screen since a much deserved burnout central award only seems proper for that performance toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but i was easily able to overlook it i wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect the movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover it's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised

<START> this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original its comedy at its best this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke br br its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirement br br gÃ¶ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor expediton robinson in swedish this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience thus don't see it if you aren't familiar with sweden and its language otherwise have fun johan
<START> the direction struck me as poor man's ingemar bergman the inaudible dialogue was annoying the somber stoicism that all characters except banderas' showed made me think they were drugged i think the director ruined it for me
<START> the man in the white suit is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick whisky galore sweet smell of success the star of the film is alec guinness whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob guiness brings his usual class to the film and makes it much more than a typical comedy br br in fact the comedy isn't entirely overt by the end of the picture it's nearly become a complete drama it's the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter but a sense of general amusement like the best british comedy of the time br br the whole idea of the suit isn't very original but the way it is executed is the film is highly original and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy br br 7 6 out of 10
<START> karen bobbie phillips mentions after one of her kids gets out of hand with his lame annoying jokes that she'll never survive this trip boy is she ever on the money karen is a school teacher taking her group of kids from the shepley college of historical studies to the butt ugly locale of a run down manor in the major dung heap of ireland surely there are places in this country more appeasing to the senses than this the caretaker of the manor gary simon peacock warns karen and her students to stay on the path and not to stray into the forest there's a myth regarding the sawney bean clan a ritualistic druid cannibalistic inbred family celebrate samhain the end of summer october 31st feast of the dead where sacrifices are needed to appease the spirits gary is supposedly clairvoyant his cousin pandora ginger lynn allen tells us because he was born on samhain funny because he sure doesn't see outcomes well or even give advice accurately nearly everyone dies even those who never stray from the path and he doesn't even see his own gruesome fate what this monster we hear breathing is a victim of way too much inbreeding it's face resembles a malformed mushroom and it looks like a hideous reject from a mad max picture it doesn't take long before the evil breeder is killing everyone paul howard rosenstein is karen's love interest who made the wrong decision coming to ireland without his girlfriend's prior knowledge br br horrible formula slasher doesn't stray from the norm it's minuscule budget shows loudly and the characters are assembly line clichÃ©s churned out yet again to be slaughtered in the usual gory ways most of the violence flashes across the screen quickly with not much dwelling on the breeder's acts of death towards his victims lots of guts get pulled out during the fast edit cuts as one scene whisks to another seeing gillian leigh's gorgeous naked body for a moment or two isn't incentive enough to recommend it phil price has the really irritating trickster character steve often shedding bad jokes how he is able to get leigh's barbara naked in the shower for some action is anyone's guess because i have no reason why he'd stand a chance with such a hottie brandi ann milbrant has the fortunate role of shae the quiet virgin smart girl who is also quite hot who we know will be the one chosen by the screenplay to survive jenna jameson drops by long enough to get her heart cut out of her chest at least we see her breasts momentarily before her chest is opened up with a few minor lines about two missing friends she's looking for the film's main problem is that the story and character development grinds to a halt because it's realized that none of them are at all interesting so director christian viel just lets loose his monster to run rampant causing carnage obliterating an entire cast almost in one fail swoop within ten minutes oh and richard grieco has a minor opening cameo as a victim who strayed off the path to tent camp with his chick
<START> galaxy express 999 ginga tetsudÃ´ three nine made in 1979 directed by rintaro based on the original work by leiji matsumoto br br what little i know of the history of galaxy express 999 it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by leiji matsumoto ge999 is set in the same star wars type of space universe as matsumoto's other famous space manga captain harlock in fact space pirate harlock and other characters from that manga including queen emeraldas and tochirÃ´ oyama make appearances in ge999 ge999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes it was aired in 1978 a year later came this anime film which isn't a sequel to the series but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie br br the story is set in unidentified star wars type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever the protagonist tetsurÃ´ hoshino is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count mecha whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills tetsurÃ´'s mother tetsurÃ´ swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body to obtain it he must travel to a far away planet with space train galaxy express 999 however since tetsurÃ´ comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman maetel who bears a resemblance to his dead mother maetel offers a ticket for tetsurÃ´ on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey and so the journey beginsÂ br br i first saw this film last october about six months from now and again yesterday i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film it seems very rushed then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurÃ´ meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes br br however there's no arguing that ge999 has deserved its place as an anime classic the animation itself very faithful to the style of matsumoto's manga is detailed and beautiful to watch even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day it was the 70's after all i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being masako nozawa mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga as the excited and young tetsurÃ´ and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel the supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress claire br br the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages ge999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsurÃ´'s journey from boyhood to manhood the whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels i think many people can relate to tetsurÃ´ for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character young hot headed awkward and naive we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesn't much answer to anything maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach br br it's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsurÃ´ and maetel that still awakes talking and questions and fascinates after the decades people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers which wakes a lot of critique since maetel's age is unknown and tetsurÃ´ hasn't even reached his puberty yet without any means to sound deep i think the best term to describe them is soul mates there is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters the ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorable br br all in all despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes galaxy express 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomo's akira 1988 and mamoru oshii's ghost in the shell 1995 the film is directed by rintaro who had previous experience of leiji matsumoto's works as he had worked in captain harlock series later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis 2001 that also questions the difference between humans and machines br br galaxy express 999 1979 is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of gilligan's island green acres the beverly hillbillies the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster jimmy stewart and ronda castle ruth roman she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction neither trusts a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from skagway to dawson but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff meanwhile rene a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return yet she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson along with ronda she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim walter brennan as ben serves as jeff's long time sidekick he doesn't have a meaty role but serves to soften jeff's hard edges his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff br br john mcintire as sheriff gannon makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his times br br jeff is the quintessential antihero a loner except for companion ben who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job in this respect he closely resemble's burt lancaster's character in vera cruz for example thus jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive then jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself he changes from anti hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon's gang from dawson in this respect he differs from lancaster's character who never reforms but is jeff truly changed or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests br br the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women clearly ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff although she is clearly characterized as a bad girl jeff has a checkered recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon and having stolen his cattle back from gannon ironically soon after jeff changes from anti hero to hero rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon's impending ambush she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself his supposedly just abandoned creed br br it's clear that corine calvert as renee just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead ronda in jeff's mind yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her he's not her father br br another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon's gang if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk before jeff did the same to him and how did jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow and why weren't most of ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche br br you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon's gang the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action all in all a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the canadian yukon which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway
<START> paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences br br unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife a conflict over a road construction project the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters a mysterious man who lives in the woods a bunch of racist hooligans at least three different carnivals the intricacies of local church politics and on and on and on and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot which is only about the hopes dreams and frustrations of two girls and their entire families at the turning point of their lives i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer and that so much movie got accomplished in 1 5 hours br br ultimately the movie is melodramatic every plot point is predictable major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later and some of those events are extremely distasteful most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime in a totally predictable twist and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on similarly a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another twist it's all totally mechanical right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends well not all of them just the ones the movie thinks you care about
<START> giant is one of the most boring overly long hollywood contraptions ever many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy rock hudson elizabeth taylor and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production a central notion to this movie that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land is absurd and i know this because i'm from houston a couple of scenes especially dean serving taylor coffee redeem this otherwise boring film for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas see hud one of paul newman's great performances or the last picture show
<START> on the 26th of september 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of leonie haddad a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had in fact come fresh from the patton state mental hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously haddad soon realised that something was 'rotten in denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven gods' haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that god has inspired me to kill you haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest it was a miracle she survived the lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent kicking and screaming back to the laughing academy ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the 'queen of the curve's the 'tennessee tease' and 'miss pin up girl of the world' the notorious bettie page br br director mary harron mainly known for 'american psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model played solidly enough by gretchen mol who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks t n b p is day glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950's where page with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like wink tab and parade her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to god the overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her mol plays page as she seems in her photographs happy carefree and fun even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility the film ends on the upbeat with page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her avoiding what i think is the essential core of page's story rebirth and resurrection br br having emerged from a decade of incarceration page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon during which many were asking whatever happened to bettie page her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend when the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines t v and being photographed at playboy parties with the likes of pamela anderson and the equally tragic anna nicole smith she found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' but in the glare of this 'resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light br br the only notorious thing about the notorious bettie page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious
