<START> but i want to say i cannot agree more with moira br br what a wonderful film br br i was thinking about it just this morning wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who'd lost money on his debit card through fraud and wanted to say 'keep thy money in thine pocket' and realised i was talking like james mason br br even tho he didn't say those words i still think he would i've never forgotten 'are ye carrying ' in his reconciliation with his son hywel bennet 'always have money in thine pocket ' good advice br br not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well meant attitudes any more or any father at all br br it would be a good thing for us to reinstate 'thee' 'thy' and 'thine' in our language to show we care it is only the same as 'tutoyer' in french or 'du' in german br br addendum i just realised that a lot of my remarks were about james mason in the family way br br i think it's because i mixed up susan george with hayley mills well easy mistake br br i stand by the comments tho' br br and spring and port wine is so very similar to the family way br br when you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days you really had something to say and talk about afterwards something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development br br theatrical experiences are almost real and they are important in helping young people to grow up br br it doesn't happen now i think that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did
<START> i first saw this film over 25 years ago on british tv and have only just caught up with it again last week on a dvd copy bought off ebay i had remembered the musical sequences the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier anna neagle michael wilding film spring in park lane and maytime doesn't stand up so well to the passage of the years but michael wilding is a joy in the film charming funny debonair appears to be having great fun and on top of his form worth watching for him alone anna neagle appears a little matronly beside him and a little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940's their film partnership was well established with the cinema going public spring in park lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker in his autobiography wilding wrote at length of his great regard for herbert wilcox the director and instigator of this london series of films
<START> this film is massively boring and pretentious there is only one good moment when a sailor shaves mr barney's think the purple dinosaur less pretense eyebrow the music is relentlessly cloying it is sad that bjork someone with so much inner beauty has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art the pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker stay tuned in a perfect art imitates life moment the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh t which is what the audience found in the theatre there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart thenÂprepare for spoilers i'm talking to you mr barney br br the emperor has no clothes mr barney you have been outted i have seen jodorowsky's holy mountain and your thin fake veil of bs has been lifted you have stolen your images your style and your entire art catalogue from this man now that holy mountain has been released finally let's hope the powers that be at the art councils of the world stop financing you poor jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon mccartney of film making and btw while jodorowsky is the beatle you are the monkees a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen and btw i am a filmmaker if you are interested in making a reality film i will legally fight you in a ring defending jodorowsky you defending outright thievery
<START> chuck jones's 'hare conditioned' is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon pitting bugs bunny against a strange yellow skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed 'hare conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi purpose setting the chase takes bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store this great gag is trumped however by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time it's a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag by that time however 'hare conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy as bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period 'hare conditioned' showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character
<START> this piece of crap since i can't call it a movie can be summed up by the following br br stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble black midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face body hair and genitalia black midget is mistaken somehow by man and woman who happen to want a baby black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence demean white people wherever he sees them and commit more crimes happy ending br br honestly it could have been a good satire if it hadn't been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it
<START> somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made one's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space or one's where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing i think it's some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes don't get me wrong this is about the 30th gay film i ve watched in the past 6 months and some of them most of them have been very formulmatic predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time the best one so far was beautiful thing so i watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered i thought oh no its going to be creative sinny mah but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash sorry i didn't like it and if you did sorry if i offend
<START> ralph and mumford misfits in their own land get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch twice upon a time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this offbeat movie hits the mark br br the animation process while similar to that of the cut out south park style is much smoother and far more three dimensional if i didn't know that the animation was this style i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx please do you won't really miss anything if you don't but if you do you will get much more out of the experience
<START> this was a cute movie at first then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs at best br br there is too much king james english spoken with is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film forget it br br bing crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as hank martin rhonda fleming alisande la carteloise was too in addition to her good looks and beautiful long red hair br br it's a nice movie with a feel good ending and i can't knock that maybe this is worthy of a rental for historical sake or if you're a big crosby fan but overall it's not that much
<START> i rented this on dvd yesterday and did not realize it was a character study type of movie so i struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the stop button br br even with a character study theme i just could not get into this film at all perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else or maybe i had other expectations but setting that aside i tried my best to move on to finish watching but gave up the actors played their roles well but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest about the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one and spray painted it black to appear as police issue i think this movie should have been entitled who stole the sergeant's gun scenes were well done but putting them together i once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing br br since i didn't finish watching it i'd say there is some merit to renting this film maybe to me it was a waste of good viewing effort and time i'll leave it up to you to try it but it's not one i'd strongly recommend
<START> wow i mean wow this has got to be one of the best story's i've ever had the chance to read watch we all know this famous story two martial artist a man and his son go to train in the forbidden cursed springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each the dad genma the spring of drowned panda and 16 year old ranma the spring of drowned girl now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in crazy enough yet no thats just the beginning as if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles an insane high school principle opponents right and left who have a score to settle with ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for stealling their loved ones and speaking of loved ones i've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with ranma and not once has it been his fiancÃ©e akane and thats just from the first few chapters episodes of the series br br the story itself is amazing i have never come across something so crazy so bizarre so so out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable i can't even describe it to its fullest its just a charming story thats so easy to get into what i like about it is the humor not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in simpson's or something of the sort i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end another thing is the characters ranma you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius and to think of the hundreds of perverts in the show ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town more so by akane the worst pervert to ever live his father genma you would think the father character would blend in to the background right correct but whenever he does have some spotlight he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him you think you know the worst dad ever from an anime you haven't met genma ryoga probably one of ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character next to ranma and probably one of the only people he can actually stand most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault is his lack of sense in direction then we have you know i could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters the story's everything positive about it but that would be just pointless br br check out the series if you haven't now you will not regret it though i would advise checking the comic out first i like the anime but i've had some trouble getting the series at a good price and a small nitpick the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga i think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me but either way its a win win 10 out of 10
<START> i won't try to speculate as to what brando was attempting at his best he turns in such oddball performances insinuating so many things at once that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others a concentration which if followed turns out something of a red herring as he turns out subtler craftier than at first appeared this is a mastery of artifice not naturalism as might be associated with the method the role of sky masterson as mankiewicz so wonderfully realized seems tailored for him which is to begin with odd and odd still at the end because whatever it is brando has done he has managed a grace maybe all his own but a consummate grace nonetheless again odd coming from an actor with limited musical ability not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy jean simmons also oddly cast is not quite as impressive but certainly above just adequate really delightful in the havana sequence and never less than enjoyable throughout br br and yet perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing and characters on what it is they intend of each other there doesn't seem to be the lovers' chemistry brought up so insistently more than once brando sky masterson and simmons sister sarah respectively feed off one another well enough but i for one don't see more beyond that in a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining and most everything about it craft wise is just that dazzling that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked but so much would depend upon true chemistry an at least partial transformation of the characters through such chemistry would lend something positively moving to the final scene as it is one leaves this film certainly delighted but not really moved except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union note sister sarah marries in her missionary's uniform sky masterson in his same natty man about town duds rather than wedding tux and they have changed back to those from their previous scene br br funnily enough that is insightfully the most touching and most serious scene is i think between brando and vivian blaine as sinatra nathan detroit's doll adelaide the only scene where these two are exclusively together not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in adelaide's dressing room while adelaide is about to change though one may submit there is no place for that sky really is the type to check out adelaide in this sort of circumstance he is even there to tell adelaide nathan will not be meeting her to elope adelaide and sky are both true in their respective ways to nathan even piteous of him as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for nathan as sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else br br guys and dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes around the themes of gambling and salvation since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind brando's and simmons' lack of chemistry after all that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation echoed by the sinatra blaine pairing though with considerably less self deception involved which might explain brando's and simmons' odd rather provoking interpretations of sky masterson and sister sarah i realize simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism but brando though playing to confront her isn't exactly heated and eager and is more than keeping his distance he's also assimilating it keeping his balance through it his boldness consists in merely playing against her the trip to cuba a kiss whatever it takes but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf this may be shrewd as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary and through but it makes sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting sarah brown a little less than persuasive yet why does he want her what does falling in love mean to sky i find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward sister sarah so he does as he's promised her need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting make good by his marker as he puts it as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her but this still denotes self concern more than anything however it also allows for sarah brown's own self concern as sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover neither at least it seems will change much by their union except perhaps in the acceptance of the other yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by chemistry and behind all this i suspect is mankiewicz's full knowing br br for all those who might say in defense of guys and dolls yet that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth i need only remind them cabaret the three penny opera carousel a star is born even the sound of music which i don't care for as much and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post cabaret musicals all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties
<START> i mean i thought i heard this dialog in the movie but it was so bad and out of place that i can't really believe it i was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history i was seriously worried that i might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater br br so this is the scene i am talking about the hero just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him the hero the hero was throwing the expected fit at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car br br in the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage emotional break down he says i am so sad he said that right am i crazy
<START> something to sing about was produced at grand national studios where james cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers warner he did two films for this b studio neither of which rank high in the cagney credits br br one of the great losses to cinema is the fact that jimmy cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities the two that come to mind immediately are yankee doodle dandy and footlight parade two lesser films are the west point story and never steal anything small cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement so why did he make so few of them br br well this one was all wrong the plot of something to sing about concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who's discovered and given a movie contract there are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by gene lockhart and william frawley his contract calls for a no marriage clause so cagney and band girl singer lady evelyn daw marry in secret then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady mona barrie i think you can figure where this is going br br the most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for cagney he dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle evelyn daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich she got the musical numbers such as they were i'm sure the movie going public was paying their tickets to see cagney dance br br also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice he danced well with ruby keeler in footlight parade and with virginia mayo and doris day in the west point story weren't ginger rogers eleanor powell or ruby keeler available br br no memorable songs came out of this and daw's voice is waisted as well she has a jeanette macdonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band br br no wonder cagney went running back to warner brothers but they should have given him some decent musicals
<START> this was the first ppv in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan the ultimate warrior ric flair and sherri martel had all left a new crop of talent needed to be pushed and this all started with lex luger a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster who was actually samoan and get the wwe championship back into american hands as such there was much anticipation for this match br br but every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuff br br the night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1 2 3 kid on raw in july ramon angry had then teamed with the 1 2 3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razor's edge br br next up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies depsite the interference of the bodies manager jim cornette who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket they were able to pull out the win in a decent match br br shawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel micheals and perfect had an excellent match here but it was diesel who proved the difference maker pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count out br br irwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night easily accounting for the 1 2 3 kid br br next came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe but lawler came out with crutches saying he'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he'd arranged another opponent for hart doink the clown hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter he was then jumped from behind by lawler this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn't wrestle hart hart then destroyed lawler winning with the sharpshooter but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short match br br the undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wippleman's client kamala at summerslam and continued when wippleman's latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania with a decisive victory over gonzales here gonzales then turned on wippleman chokeslamming him after a poor match br br next it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns bart and billy and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers samu and fatu and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samu br br this brings us to the main event with yokozuna flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express lex came out attacking but yokozuna took control lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out luger had won a fine match balloons fell from the ceiling the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win yokozuna may have retained the title but luger had proved he could be beaten the only question was who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him
<START> this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island we got it and have watched it repeatedly since in fact we've rented it several times since there are very few non animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid the acting is outstanding the songs are compelling they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along the storyline while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch i've heard it compared to mary poppins but i think they are two very different movies both excellent but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind complying with there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i don't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie
<START> unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment but it will also make you angry beyond belief br br there might be a story worth telling somewhere inside but hopkins decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layers of apparently random audio video microcuts making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short while br br why would someone like hopkins choose such a heavy most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script first score and third film can by anyones guess maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became unrecognizable as what it became not even for himself the result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result br br even the weirdest carpenter and lynch films to name just two uncoventional filmmakers had 90 more coherence 95 less characters and 99 more story flow br br sir anthony you aimed for the stars but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years please stick to acting in that department you are a unequaled giant and nobody should ask more from you not even yourself
<START> first off this really is my favorite film ever i don't need to give anyone a description because every a hole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having' boom stick showing' badly edited 80's metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy jason type of deal for himself damn i wish that could've went down like that the soundtrack's banging' the acting's good check this mofo out and any die hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime midgetorgy i can be found at yahoo
<START> in this film made just as the production code was being enforced jean harlow is eadie and patsy kelly is the wisecracking man chasing sidekick kitty girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband staying whole some in the process it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins lewis stone was the kindly doctor in grand hotel as well as judge hardy in the andy hardy films but all is not as it seems the censors must have loved harlow's line a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged later someone says you know we've never been alone together and eadie replies yeah and we're not going to be lionel barrymore is t r paige another rich uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for eadie at one point paige declares you oughta scratch me off your list i'm not a ladies man i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town what was he really saying carol tevis seems to be the high pitched baby talker as listed in the credits on imdb looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 1939 with munchkin in wizard of oz being the last part she played fun cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country look for nat pendleton as the lifeguard who was an olympic wrestler 1920 silver medal winner turned film star he was in many of the dr kildares and would appear in four of harlow's films mistaken identity plot twists a young franchot tone love stories even jean harlow in a bathing suit in palm beach although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop
<START> back in the days before the toxic avenger the low camp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhat less low road of producing straight slasher pics i'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self conscious parody br br splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let's see if i can summarize br br after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i don't recall the name but in honor of the title let's call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but don't hold your breath waiting for it there's a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it's back to the asylum and roll credits br br the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffee can sound quality and dialog that just doesn't make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killer's fixation on women the men in this movie are just so deserving i'd've paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriend's roommate or any of the creepy priests there ain't no justice
<START> a powerfully wonderful movie you are held in a death grip once you let yourself get involved with the story a successful dentist alan johnson don cheadle is torn in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family he notices his former college roommate charlie fineman adam sandler and wants to touch base he finds that charlie who lost his wife and family in the 9 11 attack on america is no longer in touch with reality choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games the former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond johnson has his friend angela oakhurts liv tyler a psychiatrist to try and bring charlie out of his grief but it is alan that accomplishes in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness jada pinkett smith plays johnson's wife writer and director mike binder plays the role of charlie's attorney guardian also in the cast saffron burrows donald sutherland adell modell and robert klein outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of bruce springsteen graham nash pear jam and the pretenders br br note i have never been a sandler fan but i found him outstanding in this role in some of the scenes i thought out loud why has he never been approached to play singer songwriter bob dylan in a biopic
