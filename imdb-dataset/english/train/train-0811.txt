<START> i read james hawes book it was pretty neat not great but entertaining enough without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on and it was still a stretch with that knowledge br br literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick br br never before or since as a film made me feel so angry the mattress sequels came closest but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did br br since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh t no that's unfair let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium br br plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema
<START> i don't know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i don't think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isn't that talented she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all it's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadn't been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasn't bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now i'm not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her i'm just saying it because i think that's what the worse part of the movie is she's probably a good actress but i can't tell because i haven't seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but i'm telling you you're way better off watching singin' in the rain
<START> father is still away on business was headline of an review after promise me this premiere in cannes i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics can't touch him i had two hours of pure energy without rest even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled surprisingly good performance of stribor kusturica much more close ups and less landscapes then in life is a miracle marija petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential please don't spoil it surely i recommend to everyone to see this film
<START> written by stephen king but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret they are sleepwalkers feline type creatures that feed on young virgins this little story has its share of gore and special effects plus hints of incest br br alice krige is outstanding as the mother others appearing are madchen amick brian krause and cindy pickett look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery
<START> i knew it wasn't gunna work out between me and d wars from the moment we met first its title was lazy d war like writing out dragon was too much for them also you really can't be that blatant with your title unless your blue monkey blue monkey can do whatever the hell it wants br br the second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression here's the film dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows old shop keep reveals several terrible truths that bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god tells the kid that he's a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in la is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he's a 500 year old asian br br fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose why continue on dear reader if you have the balls br br so sarah the reincarnated lover has her own flashbacks i have the benefit of having an asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing its a korean legend and she's reincarnated from a korean princess but everything is in chinese later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt she calls the police cause it looks like she's having a heart attack see in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy i have a new phobia now and its that if i'm ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i'm crazy br br i have another point of contention with my harsh mistress dwar there is a scene when patrick dempsey jr dreamy reporter is in a cafÃ©' with sassy black friend in the scenes prior miffed near divinity bauraki has killed an elephant slithered through a suburb and killed one of sarah's friends see people were afraid to come out after 9 11 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for business as usual no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on if i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win br br after being given a satisfying dragon on helicopter battle my cruel lover dwar treats me to a pi and vinegar filled scene to end it all with bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under la i guess they don't really say but dreamy reporter and sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up yep dragon palace some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle make love whatever and i'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere maybe you think i'm blowing it out of proportion i'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly there few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god sets baurki on fire sarah turns into a ghost and goes with dragon god dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits thank god br br now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times there was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars i'll call him tuskan shredder he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful he could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful he could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered he was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry i like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises br br the actors for the most part were great if great somehow meant terrible jason behr whom i thought was awesome in roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious spacey and patrick dempsey ish br br the one thing i love about this filthy prostitute dwars is its lead actor bauraki that giant snake acted his heart out i'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi god of evil then john barrymore was at playing richard the iii or hamlet there was emotion in every scene stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast when he ate an elephant i felt like no one past present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling he was more then an actor he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project yes damn it my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake i've got the balls to admit that do you br br here's to hoping bauraki get's more work and isn't type cast that jason behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare and that i never have to watch blue monkey again br br so d war its over i want my cds back and let's just be friends
<START> before i'd seen this i had seen some pretty bad christmas films but once i saw this jingle all the way looked better than the godfather santa claus is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids but it almost feels demonic watching it santa's jolly ho ho ho is replaces by an evil devilish laugh that i'm sure has turned many kids off of christmas the plot of this massacre is very strange which fits along with all of the performances and dialog santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas but santa has an enemy named pitch or satan pitch tries to ruin santa's christmas by making three boys naughty and by creating diversions like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog it's up to santa's helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle br br everything about this film along with being downright bad is so bizarre satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico the reindeer are wind up toys and when the reindeer laughs i'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes it's frightening everything is terrible the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from than showing them this the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema br br my rating bomb 85 mins
<START> i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film oops didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior and was very pleased to be able to watch it again and in its entirety br br i don't wholly understand the phenomenon but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons but are they actually scary no not very likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are cooler more exciting have much better production values and sophisticated special effects are more fun funnier have effective jump moments and some very creative uses of gore but again they aren't really scary there's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films the grainy film quality the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high tech lighting rigs the edge of dreamland muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq'd scores the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s in the case of horror works in its favor br br specifically in this film the quiet intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling slavering and overtly hostile cujo the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full on supernatural form the effects when that occurs while unsophisticated by today's standards literally gave me chills the bizarre vaguely defined i'm not quite sure what i'm looking at look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be rather than the hyper real crystal clear optical printer digital compositor confections of latter day horror films br br while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit the actors all do a decent job the pairing of the brother and sister from the witch mountain movies as yes brother and sister is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting but they do fine yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses his self doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naÃ¯vetÃ© br br the movie's the end question mark type ending is one of the only ones i've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it br br detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots but hey you could say the same thing about blade runner
<START> yowsa if you really want some action check out the babes and bombs on this non stop thriller veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy swimsuit scenes jiggly beach jogs hubba hubba hot tubs and the like want action you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor want babes you'll get an eyeful every two minutes want more go out and buy this video yowsa yowsa yowsa that's some mighty spicy meatballs
<START> not the most successful television project john cleese ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn't add up to much br br arthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson bionic bits and all good lord
<START> robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this taylor fled to television with the successful series the detectives br br stuart granger hid his british accent and turned in a formidable performance as taylor's partner br br taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the indians really shows br br another very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged drinking old timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well in his early scenes nolan was really doing an excellent take off of walter huston in his oscar winning role in the treasure of the sierre madre in 1948 note the appearance of russ tamblyn in the film the following year tamblyn and nolan would join in the phenomenal peyton place br br the writing in the film is stiff at best by the film's end it's the elements of nature that did taylor in how about the elements of the writing here
<START> this movie sucked the acting sucked the script sucked and the movie overall sucked there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening br br i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are examples br br the heroine's negative comments about the hero the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well br br also all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes no explanation what so ever about the guns and the folks with them br br we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back it was fun to bad mouth the movie while watching it so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment
<START> not wishing to give anything away here i would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment it will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clichÃ©d or predictable in any way most definitely recommended br br a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham carter's outstanding performances i agree entirely
<START> despite its low key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the 'r' rating in the states can't have helped honestly just because hbc uses the c word this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads br br it's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple daniel day lewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonham carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance br br branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly 'hamlet' and there his playing was diluted by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a self loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in 'the proposition' as the lawyer in 'the gingerbread man' even as andrew in 'peter's friends' this is surely his finest performance yet so why could he not produce the goods much earlier br br as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much but it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and i eagerly await more from them though not 'love's labour's lost' 8 out of 10 but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10
<START> i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the making br br but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didn't capture what i loved about the book the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the world br br from the start of the movie i realised that things weren't the same as i had imagined in the book so i just went along for the ride it wasn't all that bad i guess miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be i didn't think she would be one to smoke and drink jean kittson who plays her is hilarious br br on it's own i thought the movie and it's actors actresses in it did a good job but alas i'm such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that i couldn't help but feel disappointed p
<START> i have to say this is an awful movie for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide it is listed as a documentary as i watched it i started laughing thinking to myself does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it isn't a documentary it is now a movie with bad acting so either way it is pretty bad i actually didn't make it to the end i had to shut it off i am a nyc police officer and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers so i took it a little personal maybe i was blinded by that and it isn't as bad as i personally think it is everyone has their own opinion
<START> after becoming completely addicted to six feet under i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show well i was wrong lost is spellbinding i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off the richness of the characters the intricacies of the plot the beautiful setting are all amazing i am totally and completely hooked i don't know how the creators do it but each character touches me very deeply i feel their joy their pain everything right down to my core i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen
<START> i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job they must have anyway because since watching the movies i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff buford pusser as i can all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and buford pusser was a true hero i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain my heart goes out to them so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff pusser and of the 3 part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him please do not be negative about these movies and actors they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had and to all the young people who may have not heard much about buford i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him
<START> i remember seeing this film years ago on i think bbc2 i would very much like to view it again does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story which is why i want to view it again i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards albany234 googlemail com
<START> i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film but this is too much in the end they look like a bunch of loonies this film is one of those finding yourself 70's plots i know the film is made in 1980 a lot more of clint and girl friend movie this movie is a 3 10
<START> for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
