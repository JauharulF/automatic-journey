<START> unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non plussed to over the top the supporting cast is no better br br the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out it's just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be commended br br there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the end br br disappointed wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy
<START> this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza the kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses the movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness if you've only seen miikes far out movies ichi the killer fudoh etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself br br 8 10
<START> let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks don't bother unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children they might laugh especially if they're off their meds there's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing this film frankly ticked me off royally shame on you for stooping so low
<START> there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film there's not one scary funny or even interesting scene in this film it advertises itself as a horror then goes on to call itself a comedy it doesn't even attempt humor neither does it attempt to be scary br br in order to not be bored by this film you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this its not funny scary shocking or intriguing so was it supposed to be a drama because it really wasn't dramatic either br br please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this
<START> this film was absolutely ugh i can't find the word oh wait crap i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake what was he trying to do be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at what was amitabh doing he's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i'm telling you he's already past half his way i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh i never really liked him because he thinks he's god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie br br if you want to save your Â£17 75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts
<START> this is a rip off of the old frankenstein premise an acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father a noted brain surgeon saves the brain it is then put into a robotic body of his own design his brother an electrical genius gives the 'colossus' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion the whole project goes bad when the creation goes berserk br br special effects are undeveloped the script is lacking and it is humorous that this is not scary a bit well very small kids will think this is good if you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on night night br br the lead characters are played by otto kruger john baragrey and ross martin ed wolff played the 'colossus'
<START> that's what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it he wasn't able to keep from dozing off i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it having run out of adjectives for boring br br imagine if you will the pinnacle of hack work something so uninspired so impossibly dreadful that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable it is not not under any form of narcotic or brain damage i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is don't believe me gather 'round br br granted as a nation we in america don't always portray middle eastern peoples in a tasteful manner but how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam fashion to a stack of castrol motor oil bottles you'll find that here get it the arab worships oil i couldn't believe what i was seeing having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would've been more appropriate who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke it's not even close to cleverly offensive it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face br br in the middle of the film a five man singing group called the landmines takes the stage at an officers' ball okay are you ready the joke is they sing terribly and off key why did i write that in caps also because the joke is pound pound pounded into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags they start off mediocre enough glasses cracking punch tumblers shattering then there is i am 100 serious a two frame stop motion sequence of a woman's shoes coming off you read that correctly the music was so bad in one frame the woman's feet have shoes on in the very next the shoes are off get it because the music was so bad her shoes came off what the f br br then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell i would be astonished this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors robert downey sr directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug free badly other things to watch out for br br 1 the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible every time liceman appears a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason br br 2 barbara bach's criminally awful accent she sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue there is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like aroused retarded people br br 3 liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom remember when this movie came out throwing in abortion and condom was seen as edgy br br 4 tom poston plays a mincing boy hungry pedophile back when hollywood thought pedophile and homosexual were one in the same flat out embarrassing br br 5 watch the ending nothing is wrong with your vcr that is actually the ending tell me that doesn't make you want to explode everyone who's ever made any movie ever br br watch this at your own risk up the academy has been known to actually make other movies like the jerk or blazing saddles less funny simply by placing the videotape near them
<START> saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out boy was i disappointed the story is extremely boring the acting aside from christopher walken is bad and i couldn't care less about the characters aside from really wanting to see nora's husband get thrashed christopher walken's role is such a throw away what a tease
<START> though i like e e doc smith's books and david a kyles books of lensman the anime which is loosly based on the books is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair br br though the story may seem familiar to sci fi fantasy buffs such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless plus lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once sure it may look a bit outdated now but it is still an innovation if it were not for lensman none of that would have ever happened personally i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action br br too bad they only released it on dvd vcd in a few countries in the worls mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd vcd in every part of the world not just certain parts br br p s worsel rules i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well
<START> i bought this dvd for 1 at walmart after seeing it i might just return to the store and try to get my money back the only reason i gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements though it really never rises to the level of being interesting this film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive in theaters market ultra low budget amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex for an early 60s film in fact i wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck and because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras the film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes however they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs
<START> i am surprised that everyone even the critics seems to think this was a good movie it was the most clichÃ©d thriller ever made that i have seen we have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' or girls in this case to do something or face the consequence the 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones using charisma bravery and even luck to save the day br br where to begin well a young woman by the name of lisa reisert meets a young man by the name of jackson rippner nice name at an airport one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together sharing drinks sitting next to each other seemingly getting along in every way is there more to this strangeness could these two be meant for each other does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter br br well as it turns out unfortunately yes jackson needs to lisa to help him assassinate the director of homeland security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him oh if she doesn't do this then her father is dead though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in lisa's best interest to help him br br of course lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck makes him trip over chairs and hitting him with a field hockey stick oh and before that she leads him on wild chase through miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father br br yeah right br br first of all i find it strange that a man like jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building wouldn't that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties and why do characters like jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people br br the actors did their best considering the movie they were given racheal mcadams and cillian murphy are still actors to look out for also i believe that jayma mays who played the 'loveable' cynthia will be someone we will see more of it's just too bad they all were stuck with this br br 2 out of 10
<START> this show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i love eric and kelso yeah i know what they say after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show and randy is a real dumbass randy is comparing to eric and kelso br br you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with i'm a cool guy kind of guy randy it isn't his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny it's still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its alright br br the 360's are awesome the circle red is a real kind of mental abusing dad and kitty is always half high half pie hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna they're cool but not without kelso and eric br br great show dumbass
<START> i thought intensive care was quite bad and very unintentionally funny but at least not as bad as i thought it might be sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful but never a good shocker br br spoiler ahead br br the fun lies in ridiculous moments but the all time classic moment is this peter koen wauters is stabbed and beaten by the killer he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway amy nada van nie kneels beside him and asks poor peter shall i get you a band aid br br this movie was shot in dutch and english to spare costs all license plates are usa and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan very funny if you're dutch and watching the original version in dutch
<START> an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece ah there in lies the rub br br broken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage quote from the video box as she's held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself while they question her a black clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensues br br fortunately for us director alex ferrari seems to know what he's doing or at least he's very good at faking it broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for ferrari and producer writer jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not really br br though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no genre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full length feature the final twist doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete here's to knowing he's getting the chance br br audio broken's dolby digital 5 1 presentation is second to none in the indie world i've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive dolby 2 0 surround track which is the menu default br br extras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features br br the extras are broken down into categorical menus these include pre production production post production after the short and cast and crew bios from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they would've been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart br br it has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine through br br the willingness to share their film making secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry on top of this i was given several alternate options in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvd br br overall i've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10 but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because i'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the feature length version will get
<START> i just watched this horrid thing on tv needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get frankly i don't know how much lower the bar can go br br the characters are composed of one lame stereo type after another and the obvious attempt at creating another bad news bears is embarrassing to say the very least br br i have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is numero uno br br let me put it to you this way i watched the vanilla ice movie because it was so bad it was funny this this is not even that good
<START> while some scenes of training were realistic too many of them depicted military instructors as ex nazi types obviously the people who wrote the screen play were either anti military types or writing a film for that audience br br i am a viet nam vet and even during this period military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison br br and i really loved the scene where the hero and his buddy both privates are sitting down in the captain's office smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation as was the purpose for the scene br br at the end i asked myself what was this film about as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except i hate all authority thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it
<START> once in a while you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained vivah is just that Â maybe more after watching ddlj saajan and lamhey i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that ever boy was i wrong i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh Â although the decision is already made in my mind after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i don't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor boy Â was i wrong about this movie this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept of arranged marriage but also that he did it with a conviction that it is the right thing to do i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor after company and salman found his groove after hum aapkey hain kaun this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj even though he is shown to be an indian in england Â both countries not big on basketball by the way he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values amrita rao for the first time came across as someone to be remembered in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one i think this movie will and should do wonders for her move over rani Â there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either yes people i will challenge you find even 0 1 fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too i thought i will never be enamored by anyone's beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered hum aapkey hain kaun when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again right away yes right away i have never ever done that not even with ddlj but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with i miss those times where families sat down and had fun when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down don't we all want it to happen the families thee tradition the love and respect this is what this movie will remind all of us of i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them
<START> the movie follows the events of the novel cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by marin preda a very controversial book and movie a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its satiric contents over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the humanist in a red world a movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe one of the greatest romanian movies despite its psychological charge after all it is an european movie
<START> i've seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the best but a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh darn cute and well made marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst's mistress br br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must see
<START> i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie long time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days aren't exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis however too much of the plot takes place off screen like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience i e me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i can't say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon and i still like nick
