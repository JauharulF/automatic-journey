<START> ok i think the tv show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved so when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie i decided to tag along i wish i'd stayed home and watched the tv show instead br br the fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie the plot is next to non existant the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and worst of all gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever it appears that disney took all of the things that make inspector gadget work on tv and tossed them all to be fair my younger child 8 years old liked the movie but the older one 10 years old came away thinking it silly he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor br br generally i like disney films but this one misses by a mile it is ok for a very narrow age band say 7 to 9 but a must miss for everybody else
<START> no br br basically your watching something that doesn't make sense to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story br br a normal everyday to day women is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family br br i specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was the acting was great the events were great but the story just brought it nowhere it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing br br spoiler starts br br they had this area between 2 dimensions ours and behind the glass that would come into our world and kill us it was not elaborated on all during the film and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened nothing gets explained during the film the main character shouldn't of even been the main character at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away her sisters boyfriend should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after br br i bought this movie for 10 threw it out right after don't waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again
<START> domino has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and sickening photography it's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of style over substance i couldn't disagree more i believe that domino represents the absolute height of tony scott's film making career br br after having created the dominant hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties tony scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema as early as crimson tide scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched angle framing this was then carried through to enemy of the state and spy game which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively br br man on fire was an extreme departure a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic here scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in domino br br couched in the framing device of an fbi interrogation domino presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory she grasps at memories as we all do in fragments flashes and brief snatches as domino relays her story verbally scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them she does have traces of mescaline in her system but her individual vision is anyway unusual that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting br br it is when domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that scott really lets rip together with cinematographer dan mindel and composer harry gregson williams scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary americana gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be domino is no more disjointed than the 90210 culture she has rejected as she wades through this cultural melange scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces ultimately scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip br br to criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a picasso or a pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human like any great painting the meaning in domino is in the surface and the surface is everything br br i am not in any way associated with scott free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of tony scott's work
<START> when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this ova is kinda the opposite though there're only half a dozen episodes it isn't filled with action but emotional things the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilian esquire movie this movie did a fantastic job of that what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis most people that don't like anime that i've forced to watch this movie lol liked it so i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti war story if you're a gundam fan and haven't seen this you shouldn't be reading this you should already be watching it right now
<START> this review is for the extended cut of this movie br br i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea br br that being said i've always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene br br well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrel climb rugby like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragon jackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around br br other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does br br i suggest everyone who is a hong kong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended or at least that's how i think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same
<START> i dont know about you but i've always felt drawn to 'art' cinema the first 'art' film i managed to get a hold of was peter greenaway's the cook the thief his wife and her lover which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive the film was the ultimate paradox both beautiful and grotesque this is what 'art cinema' was about exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose life real life can be like living in a madhouse and art expressed shows it for what it is i love movies of all types but especially those that both entertain and have something to say whether i agree with it's stance or no br br 8 1 2 women is a dry clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies there is only a very brief allusion to fellini in the film unlike what the previews have suggested the main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son brought together after the mothers' death in the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable you can feel his pain what happens afterwards is plain by greenaway standards the gathering of the harem observations on love and death and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh one could argue this but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless and the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me the acting for the most part if fine especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer though poor mandy should put her clothes back on what the film lacks is a compelling story and the usual greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch br br while filled with moments of insight and the occasional taboo 8 1 2 women is too cut and paste to be considered art too bland to considered 'funny' and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile br br save your money i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid br br 4 out of 10
<START> the title has many meanings the boxing ring where differences and grievances are fought out a wedding ring where mabel feels trapped and jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble a ring like bracelet that bill gives mabel as a love token br br former professional boxer danish carl brisson was given his start in films by alfred hitchcock in the ring a very young ian hunter who went on to have such a long career in movies plays bob corby who catches the eye of a pretty girl mabel lillian hall davis at a fun fair she happens to be engaged to one round jack sander carl brisson but that doesn't stop her flirting with bob bob is persuaded to go one round with jack he goes several rounds and wins he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if jack is as good a fighter as they have heard he offers to take jack on and jack goes off along with his boorish trainer the great gordon harker to make his fortune with plans to marry mabel when he makes good jack wins his fight and marries mabel the next day but the deep attraction that she and bob feel for each other is still there jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight bob for his wife br br at last a boxing movie where the hero doesn't go off the rails bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion if only mabel acted in the same way she has left him for bob and the fight at the end is a mighty one it is intensely realistic it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film from being raw and enthusiastic jack is almost knocked out then between rounds reuniting with mabel gives him the courage to triumph the question is why would he even want her back from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with bob why wouldn't she do it again br br the film is loaded with symbolism jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to mabel's hands accepting a bracelet from bob when jack puts the ring on mabel's finger bobs bracelet slips down her arm at the end jack sees mabel's reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on this is an excellent film that will not disappoint you br br highly recommended
<START> gillian anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun after a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked after recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge br br i thought straightheads was terrible violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant if i didn't dislike the phrase a great deal i would call straightheads a video nasty certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's frankly i don't know how straightheads got a cinema release br br i am not a prude i don't mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both straightheads had neither no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid luckily straightheads went nowhere fast it was only 80 minutes long br br it was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third how often do i say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly what a shame i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film she especially is very underrated and is still particularly fit br br if you want to see a good british revenge movie rent or buy shane meadows' dead man's shoes it is a little masterpiece last weekend i should have seen his this is england instead ce sera sera
<START> this was my first introduction to the world of bollywood and i'm now hooked okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching us films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won't be disappointed the songs are superb melodic and very catchy the actors are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world locations colour are spellbinding if you want something different and are looking to be uplifted cheered up and stimulated i recommend you catch this movie
<START> man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp played by the great richard o' sullivan who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate the obvious ends up happening as he moves in br br man about the house was a pre cursor to cooke and mortimer's spin off show george and mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to jo chrissy and robin these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred the late and much missed yootha joyce in particular getting some of the best lines of the series a semi regular character was larry doug fisher a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something and never to return it br br the american's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script what a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard br br this programme is available on network dvd
<START> dressed to kill 1980 is a mystery horror film from brian de palma and it really works the atmosphere is right there the atmosphere that makes you scared and isn't that what a horror film is supposed to do all the actors are in the right places michael caine is perfect as dr robert elliott the shrink with a little secret angie dickinson as kate miller the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific keith gordon as her son peter is brilliant nancy allen as liz blake the call girl is fantastic dennis franz does his typical detective role his detective marino is one of the most colorful in this movie there are plenty of creepy scenes in this movie the elevator scene is one of them there have been made comparisons between this and alfred hitchcock's psycho 1960 there are some similarities between these two movies both of these movies may cause some sleepless nights
<START> touching well directed autobiography of a talented young director producer a love story with rabin's assassination in the background worth seeing br br
<START> possible spoilers br br this straight to video mess combines a gun toting heroine grade z effects nazis a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it's still boring the video's 45 minute running time only seems like eternity the only good part is one of the blooper outtakes wherein the bad guys force a 400 pound egyptologist into a chair and one villain's foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf bowling or tennis instead
<START> follows the same path as most sequels first one was great second was average and this one full of bad acting and some stupid dialog and well as a lot of suspension of disbelief this movie was weak br br too predictable and i just couldn't stand that henry wrinkler like boss with that stupid eye there was so much more they could have done with this i liked the first one a lot i wish they would have went more down those lines rather than what they did here br br there was too much unexplained that needed to be explained what time period this was in and why why why is there an old fashioned phone in that room br br i understand there is another one in the works br br blah
<START> recap it's business as usual at louche's casino in tanger the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day the owner louche and some staff leave for the night leaving modesty in charge suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino shooting wildly unknown to modesty they have already killed louche and are now after the money hidden in the vault but no one present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants can't blow the door as planned suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters' leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy br br comments this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise as i have neither seen nor read any of it the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot sure there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story br br as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense filled scene is the game between modesty and miklos it's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv series and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such but i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action instead i enjoyed this game the history much more than a simple action movie br br i think the two main stars alexandra staden and nikolaj coaster waldau did very well staden especially portrays modesty very well and really carries this confident and talented character br br 7 10
<START> crime boss is directed by alberto de martino an italian crime drama partially filmed in hamburg germany an easily forgotten movie even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly a new don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake brutality and violence breed the same in return this can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics just the look of the film brings back memories of american drive in fare even the popular american actor telly savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama antonio sabato also stars with paola tedesco guido lollobrigida serio tramonti and piero morgia

<START> this movie i don't know why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin i will never know why they would spend money on art direction and some not all that bad special effects then not bother to edit it properly i will never know why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period and sometimes bizarrely not why they commissioned such bad songs why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever not even on a silly children's film level what were they thinking nothing about this movie is quite as it should be every single part is dubbed and always poorly every sound effect is slightly wrong every edit is in the wrong place every performance is bad in some way it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere despite all the problems but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren's creation
<START> while this is a faithful adaptation it is much less exciting than greene's novel also it's a bit ridiculous when people say things to boyer like you're spanish aren't you br br still the movie's not at all bad just slow moving br br
<START> a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit man changes both their lives this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writer director shepard in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life davis is fine as kinnear's flirtatious wife mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy
