<START> masters of horror has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes ' and while a definite case can be made for joe dante's 'screwfly solution' one of the best episodes of the series period most efforts to do so have come across as anvil heavy and unimpressive nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox and 'pro life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra violence young angelique caitlin wachs seen running through the woods is nearly hit by 2 doctors mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier who just happen to be driving in to work at the local and isolated abortion clinic angelique's father dwayne ron perlman is a stone cold far right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion if for nothing else 'pro life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself which is admittedly poor the slow pacing builds no tension and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic guns blazing it is a stunning non event later when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion ' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary an effort to pad out the underwritten film the poor performances perlman is sadly wasted here become an outgrowth of the script and carpenter's direction feels exhausted as if 'pro life' is the source of his next hot meal by the time a spider creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking

<START> a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindberg br br for me the jig saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be said br br sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all
<START> i saw this 25 years ago on pbs it was very difficult to watch so real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending no time for courting fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work this was based on the woman's actual diary which i read many years later she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves she learned to mow which was not lady like she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun browned calloused hands but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do it both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home it was so so sad when the baby died of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine that only makes the tragedy extra sad i was crying so hard but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf spring is on its way and life goes on in her diary she did have two more boys and they lived
<START> a bad one br br oh my this is one of the movies which doesn't have even one positive effect just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky i just wonder how low i q you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy br br is there something than this is worth watching for well there is a lot of nudity involved but it's nothing particular and when you just think that it couldn't get worse your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old c'mon guys where did you search for these actresses in elderly home perhaps br br anyway the leading actresses has some sex appeal and knows how to show it again too bad that she is too skinny old all in all skip these one br br 2 out of 10
<START> everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of Âles visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because she's replacing her but that's Âgrotesque' lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a cÃ©sar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played Âlemercier playing her role' as for the story it's just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poirÃ© and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and dÃ©jÃ  vu no really there's no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a Âbrainless moment' 2 10
<START> sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in sweden a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary it was shown in gÃ¶teborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto director in focus of the festival she gave a master class very much appreciated telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice the first version got lost for good so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end a pretty awful problem happened in this case to create the possibility of a very strong movie
<START> i don't believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an uncomplicated plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing
<START> even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic i don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if you're going to release it as a joke like this don't i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke please
<START> this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message both in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing credits we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real
<START> this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest in my opinion a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her and at this point i will say that these films are not real they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible br br the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases for example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl and how stupid this looks the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of fingernails worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig although it is not as bloody as the next part flowers of flesh and blood which tries to be as shocking as possible br br guinea pig devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is this is still of course faked s n t uff the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s y and repulsive they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it i watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now i know how insignificant trash these are they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole guinea pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen so these are pretty extreme in my book but that's all they are
<START> i saw this movie at sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was although based on the catalog description i was excited to see it supposedly a mockumentary of two high school students making a documentary of high school life it featured bad acting bad directing completely lack of engaging characters as written and all around is a total bust i love good movies about high school and this is not one of them the characters are one dimensional and self consciously cool although they are supposed to be outcasts you get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on purposely bad movie to show their friends yet somehow it got into sundance mystifying
<START> reese witherspoon plays dani a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new 17 year old neighbor court played by jason london court tries his best to make dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable soon the nubile charm of dani starts winning over court's will next enters the meeting of dani's older sister played by emily warfield and the beginning of a short lived love jealousy problem br br tess harper and sam waterston round out the cast this is a fresh free spirited but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep feel free to cry
<START> something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer wedding crashers is similar but they are two different films in some respects both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over the top crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films both have some sort of formula to the stories as well but by the end of the 40 year old virgin i think i found overall it was more satisfying than 'crashers' although one can guess where the relationship story with steve carrell's character andy and catherine keener's character trish will go to it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with crashers and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic more rounded than most of the one dimensional or unexplained people in the other and perhaps it may also depend on how much you identify or just find the lunacy in both br br the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve carrell as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn as carrell has built up his cult status on the daily show one of my favorite shows on now and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in anchorman and bruce almighty this is his first starring role but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle he and co writer director judd apatow treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way even early on as he talks to his action figures while re painting them it's also a tricky line to walk on in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh hartnett also about sexual dysfunction as the title suggests andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little pee wee herman in him the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious a good sign br br so his friends among them paul rudd romany mancoy seth rogen all very good comic foils try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over andy's head to pop his cherry so to speak he almost gets with a overly drunk woman he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl and almost with his own boss jane lynch also very funny in the mockumentaries as a explitive buddy but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with trish who works across the street from him as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex one might worry that the plot gear of how is he going to tell her such and such might get in the way of the comedy it doesn't in fact if anything carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree for practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length there was barely a moment i wasn't laughing whether big or small br br the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot or one or two little stray stories the fellow co workers have their own relationship problems as well rudd's being the funniest the big laughs come through because of carrell's reactions and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor charm or that its with some truth keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship and un like 'crashers' there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face carrell gets very high points here and like with a farrelly brothers movie the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity the 'waxing' scene which was done for real by the way and the sort of aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film the way it comes out at first is a total uproarious surprise but if you're willing not to get offended by it there's more where that came from this is one of the funniest films of the year
<START> seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his quite frankly unforgivable crime br br the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window what you see is exactly what is happening even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds there is absolutely no twist whatsoever there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening br br normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode the guy is at his best when sporting a gun driving a ford gt and saying aw hell nah as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for this is probably the main reason why i wasn't looking forward to the movie although here he is very understated there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award br br the supporting cast were all grand too rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players br br overall it is a weepy but it isn't throwing all the usual clichÃ©s and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real br br i would give it 8 10 the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it
<START> i had numerous problems with this film br br it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics which is fine although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying aren't you just blown away by this well not really these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore at any rate i was already familiar with quantum theory and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations etc is not new br br the main problem i have with this movie however is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism i don't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism but quantum mechanics doesn't really have anything to do with these things and it should be kept separate the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better the reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory for every so called expert that they interviewed for this film there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree they would point out quite rightly that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness br br it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo scientific arguments br br avoid this film br br oh yeah at one point one of the experts says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false huh that totally does not follow and even if it did i don't see how that helps his argument i mean if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too based on his own reasoning
<START> that's right the movie is better than the book don't get me wrong i love the book but the movie is just so much better this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best i haven't seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series but i missed a few the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book so if you're looking for a great movie get stanley kubrick's the shining but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks
<START> worst dcom i have seen ever well maybe not as bad as smart house this was just bad the acting and story was fine but the effects sucked br br they were so fake the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen that was probably the only scene in which i was excited br br overall i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly br br i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene br br 4 10
<START> in short this movie is completely worthless br br the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flops br br apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality and i don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics they don't measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way br br the story is horrible beyond belief in fact i can't believe i didn't just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception why is the morris paley character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah there's a great hero for you dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic br br plot holes 1 why did bai ling's character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the vials and had not found them 2 why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed he doesn't have or know about the vials and the bad guys didn't know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex 3 polly indicates that they don't know anything about totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him 4 the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot 5 at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back br br sigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap br br we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen br br and the acting we're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character isn't annoying i think ling bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesn't have a single line the dialogue wasn't camp and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people aren't hero's or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life br br i can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom 100 of all time
<START> i love the satan pit david tennant is such a great actor and so is billie piper who else loves will thorp to pieces he is so cute isn't he i hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to go to hell as rose so bluntly put it mind you he was quite funny when he said rose do us a favour will you shut up mr jefferson was so brave wasn't he dying to save the others i felt really sorry for toby will thorp when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared i was like oh my god if i was rose i'd be so scared for him and when she hugged him i was like grrrrrr he's mine hands off but i thought that was really sweet and the doctor well i thought he was gonna say to ida tell rose i love her but he didn't oh well
