<START> a good film with for its time an intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford's the searchers though not so brutal the story starts fast and doesn't let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewart's jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river 1952 also a mann stewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few caveats a too quickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending 24 year old corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery can't be beat a fine western costume drama
<START> i can't say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing i've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse but what i have seen is absolutely awesome i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good but this role i just his acting is great his character early seems so normal well okay creepy dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess and juliette lewis's performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing sadly i have yet to see the end but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good but disappointing i have to admit that i wish david duchovany's sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect was a bit flat but for him it was okay his wife's character was better and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good a portrait of the avant gard older sister type particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together i've watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie's reaction to it everything about that i think is just so perfect i mean maybe it's because i can relate a bit i'm not sure br br as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once i thought he was great some movies with pitt that i've seen were just average or not worth seeing i don't think i've ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors this movie was not one of them he turned out a great performance in kalifornia i swear i'm not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking i mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means pitt is dark brooding and downright scary at times yet he's also cheerful funny nice and even loving towards adele granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that's probably just me and the character pitt played in the movie but it also shows how good pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character that is what good acting is supposed to do br br at any rate i wish i could say more but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending i have seen most of the movie through what i've caught on fuse and as i'm writing this i'm taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked it shouldn't have
<START> the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this 'film' got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film 'a hard day's night br br richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost 70Â£ to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length br br the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model's face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks according to neil sinyard author of the films of richard lester this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive kites while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles
<START> have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon oh you have was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon i didn't think so br br i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen much like the pixar movies it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen and this attention to detail is staggering the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action br br although the plot may not be entirely unique the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching our protagonists are likable and interesting ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path of course hector is the character most will fall in love with a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of br br in summary i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity watch it for the incredible animation the breath taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen at the very least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half no matter if you're nine or twenty nine which in fact i am
<START> i caught this movie on fx last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad cinematography bad sound totally unbelievable fight sequences stupid characters all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen it was so bad i was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi competent that i had to keep watching and they made a sequel
<START> i should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men the special effect were horrible i hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology how can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1 10th the speed how can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them how can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away how come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself br br not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder there were the standard dialogues like ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai ise laath mat maro and pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to hindustaan me hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai stupid to say the least br br what shobha de had written is true the director worked without a script and it shows there is no flow to the movie there is no gradual progression from one battle to another it is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war the explanatory scenes are awful the chief of army staff looks unconvincing to make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours
<START> dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred br br novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall br br one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned the monk recounts the history of the house which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence and then the film simply cuts away to something else earlier the monk had offered to help well where is the help the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier try to drive the spirits out of the house although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care br br there are some probably unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing but on the whole this is a forgettable dud
<START> i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it it features tÃ©a leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing one episode after the next i guess it didn't make it so big and was cancelled after a few seasons but i believe it was a good run and would suggest watching it if the opportunity arises
<START> edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
<START> the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham fisted and clichÃ© ridden br br i cant blame the actors but surely someone must have said are you joking i cant say this br br this episode had a press perspective and police perspective while the police perspective was standard enough the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable br br i notice that this was an hbo co production if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light br br i was completely cringing during the press conference scene it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true 40 minutes into the first episode and i am still waiting for the suspense br br skip five daysthis the 2008 9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top br br this story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable br br for a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions br br so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour br br i then began looking for journalists called scoop and for perry white to make an appearance br br i saw the 2009 hunter before five days made it to australia not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to bonneville and mcteer going around again br br head shakingly awful
<START> for a long time 'the menagerie' was my favorite 'star trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'city on the edge of forever ' what i used to prefer about 'menagerie' was that it's more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the talosians' mind control abilities and captain pike's condition why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st's only two parter
<START> after the atomic bombs carried by a shot down soviet bomber explode in the arctic the creature 'gammera' is released from his hibernation the giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to tokyo and destroys anything in his path the military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before tokyo is laid to waste according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br the re produced for american audiences version of this the first film in the gamera series adds english language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed japanese fare clearly the monster is following in the footsteps of godzilla taking his cue from abc's faddish batman tv series musician wes farrell's ludicrous theme song heightens the us version's camp appeal br br gammera the invincible 12 15 66 sandy howard noriaki yuasa dick o'neill brian donlevy albert dekker john baragrey
<START> the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial but still it's carried out fairly well and the story especially the dialogue are interesting they've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play perhaps it's a good introduction to shaw's plays br br the main character raina has her head in the clouds and a flair for the dramatic and helena bonham carter's acting does a good job here her fiancÃ© serges is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure her parents are entertaining enough
<START> love trap is not a short it's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes br br while i'm writing this i might as well talk a bit more about love trap i'm frequently asked what makes love trap different this is how i respond to that question 1 it introduces characters one in particular that have never been seen before in film period br br 2 it reveals more truth about love and delves more deeply into the very concept of love than any other u s film ever made in my humble opinion br br 3 structurally as in the way the story is told it is unlike any love story you've ever seen br br 4 it offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues both within and outside the black community br br over time people will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era delightfully refreshing authentic and honest it is a rare morality play full of food for thought br br please visit www lovetrapmovie com for complete and accurate info about this film
<START> start with the script i have seen cartoons with more depth than envy anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which envy certainly is a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies flirting with disaster and duplex immediately come to mind be certain that envy is not a black comedy there are no double meanings just total nonsense envy deserves it's low rating because like it's subject matter it stinks merk
<START> the godfather part i was a stunning look inside the fictional corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of the godfather part ii shows that young man's acceptance of his new role his desensitization of character as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two parts of this saga of this transformation of michael corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history br br then along came the godfather part iii michael corleone is now the aging don of the corleone family he shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is michael corleone michael's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies michael's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to michael realizing that his entire life as don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his family br br the godfather part ii ends with michael corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed before part iii was made the godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him family loyalty part iii paints the picture of michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance this greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films br br the godfather part iii is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made the only solution to the problem that is this final installment of the godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed
<START> previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i'm a guy in his 60's i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 7 0 rating by imdb com users br br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while 29 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 10 7 gave it a 1 rating these 10 7 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7 0 br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 0 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture br br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point heaven's gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters' ratings were 23 2 10 ratings and 9 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 1 big top pee wee 1988 got 4 3 10 ratings and 9 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 5 cat people 1982 got 6 1 10 ratings and 2 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 8 blind date 1987 got 3 0 10 ratings and 2 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 3 jumpin' jack flash 1986 got 4 4 10 ratings and 3 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 2 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 10 7 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned br br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor br br
<START> before the devil knows you're dead starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in rashomon style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multi faceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotions relations as the story comes to its chilling climax br br as is the case with lumet he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star studded cast without any notion of over acting or hyperbole philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke who plays his brother hank that's not to say that hawke is not bad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this albert finney's character andy and hank's father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screen time amy ryan also performs her job adequately br br before the devil knows you're dead is not an exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an illustrious career many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here not least of which involves the use of his characters infused with a killer script no pun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows you're dead is a must see a truly underrated gem 8 10 3 stars out of 4 should just enter my top 250 at 248 highly recommended
<START> deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follows as deathstalker hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lord's cave he meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to tolkien and of course conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies br br there are no many cinematic merits in this film couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of hill females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably as i said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else this belongs to the category it's so bad it's great br br deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film i appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course if bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don't understand enjoyably bad films then stay away and if somebody can't stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well there is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an r rating otherwise this could be some safe pg family film br br 4 10
<START> dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise a young mafia would to be killer chandler must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some lessons with a very known professional killer beluschi first and most important task to kill a young woman lee that is a completely strange for all of them but is she a easy target the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie good performance by chandler i give this a 4 four
