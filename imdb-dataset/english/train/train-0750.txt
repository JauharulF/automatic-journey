<START> i understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different i understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss understood movie my point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent she uses daddy's' money to make a movie she wrote directs and pays for obviously to close to the movie to realize there was no character development and no directions such as a beginning middle and ending the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point i saw a women go to a house find some pictures screw the caretaker come out side on a very cold night not believable to check on noise and runs over her caretaker lover movie ends some one educate my ignorant arss i really want to know what the point is what was the directors' vision why no development of the dead lover why no background on the caretaker what is the point of the night vision what is the point of the lipstick on the car why a dead caretaker why tell us about an escaped mental patient peeping tom what's with the urn oh and the lamp is that suppose to signify whose' house this is territorial why why would the caretaker feel like it's his house that aspect was never pursued as for william defoe i rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters write back and do tell me what i need to learn i am just a mom in middle america who loves movies chris
<START> murders are occurring in a texas desert town who is responsible slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions the latter really doesn't fit but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity which are two conventional elements for these films br br dana kimmell of friday the 13th part 3 infamy stars as the bratty quasi detective teen br br 1 2 out of br br mpaa rated r for violence and gore nudity and some language
<START> while most of the movie is very amateurish the kosher slaughter scene is played up but not untrue kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter in which the animals throat is cut and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive conscious and obviously suffering we must remember that history is written by the victors is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right br br doesn't it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter and the jews are still practicing it even today
<START> if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum's work br br may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was br br poor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this low br br horrible
<START> seriously i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and words have failed me br br i remember a time when i would see charles band's name on a film and my heart would race he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter he was a bastion of hope for the little man the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure br br and now this br br a painfully obvious californian walking trail doubles for the alps and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be an ancient cave i mean they didn't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ugh instead of a creepy demon gladiator as the cover implies we're treated to a dude wearing the latest in wal mart halloween apparel there's a pretty cool looking corpse who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers but he doesn't even learn to stand until the final five minutes why couldn't he be the villain instead we've got frat boy joe with a plastic sword ouch br br charles band you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe i love movies that are so bad they're good hell i occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad its just bad this one however is just unwatchable a perfect example of making a buck rather than making a quality film
<START> nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous this is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved don't waste your time
<START> i feel monarch cove was one of the best written and acted out drama series to come on any network in a long time this show had great potential and i couldn't wait to view it each week this could be developed into a great primetime soap people look forward to this type of acting as we are being reality tv overkilled i long for the type of writing and acting that shows like dallas knots' landing dynasty melrose place etc provided monarch cove updated this concept quite well and i anticipated it only getting better there's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right it would be a loss to not explore this and develop these characters after having drawn and hooked us into their world i absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious interesting and sensuous without going overboard or offending loved it
<START> forget plan 9 this is the ultimate fiasco a costume drama ineptly directed scripted acted etc this film is based on isabel allende's not so much better novel i hate meryl streep and antonio banderas in non spanish films and the other actors including winona my favourite actress and jeremy irons try hard to get over such a terrible script plenty of mistakes like for example since when does it snow in xmas in chile and very cruel with tons of that evil named magic realism this stands out as the worst movie of all time it totally sucks
<START> castle of blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in italy in the 60s the film has all of the right elements old dark house atmosphere a decent story and barbara steele steele makes most any film worth seeing br br the story concerns a haunted castle people have visited but none have returned our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings but the night he visits is a special night it's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths br br the only flaw i see in the movie is the running time it almost feels padded there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest but once he does find something the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable br br castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general
<START> is there a book titled how to make a movie with every 'man vs nature' clichÃ© imaginable if not ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes the set up the characters the various sub plots the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times Â and in most cases much better it's amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie br br and can someone please tell me what in god's name myrna loy is doing in this monkey turd of a movie a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies
<START> ms patty duke's story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles i saw myself acting out just like her i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children br br i saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and i have loved this movie so much anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for that is not the issue here the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame ms duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope br br unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don't know the hell they have to live with the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts it was so real so so real it was like watching myself up there on screen br br i wish i could thank ms patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness bocka
<START> this is a review of 'freddy mercury the untold story ' theatrical release chicago int film festival 2007 one of the phoniest uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries i have seen if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv i would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature even as a made for tv documentary the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial the only redeeming aspects of this the untold story of freddy mercury or uhm was it the untold story of princess diana are the original concert video and tv footage unabridged freddy mercury and queen testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights such as he was a free spirit really i thought freddy mercury was a company man belittle those freddy testimonials by brian may or montserrat caballe that shed new and affectionate light into mercury's complex life and character and what up with the harry potter like boarding school segments how did the interview with the first girl crush who now works in a travel agency and members of freddy's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury vital milestones of his personal life his sexuality his artistic style and growth queen the band remain unexplored these filmmakers don't ask a single provocative question nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a sunday night
<START> well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces but i personally think it is it's a very beautiful sweet movie henry winkler did a great job with his character and it really impressed me
<START> catscratch is the best thing to come out of nickeloden including wayne knight this show doesn't just appeal to maoris and pi's some people love it and they're all aussies at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude but it grows enormously on you also to correct something that one of the other critics has said in correct tv com doesn't say does that mean you're homo now he says does that mean you're homo owww this is his phrase in the show mr blik is i think the funniest of all like peww weww's playhouse br br firstly i'll admit that the early episode were a bit good but after a while the episodes became great and just when the series had found it's surreal whacky nickelodeon cancels it br br i know nick is meant for kids but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults these shows include mr bean the animated series charlie brown pelswick rocko's modern life at times and invader zim all of these must have been considered too good with the exception of catdog 'cause nick felt the need to cancel them br br what i like the famous final episode where gordon fight a duck br br i'd also like to see a dvd with plenty of audio commentaries and behind the scenes docos and including the final episode br br but of course what i'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air wake up nick br br i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing credits that would be great
<START> how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this it's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent even the well known gottfried john is acting very poor especially in the double murder scene how amateurish the screen plan is very very extended perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen f g the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor probably reason different languages of actors but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch it's a diabolic waste of time
<START> as always controversial movies like this have mixed reviews you either love it or you hate it and not everyone will like this movie this shows the perspective of the killers which is something i personally feel is something important to consider you may hate them you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective br br the movie is shot entirely using a hand held camera something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic it is told completely from the killers point of view from their missions to family outings all leading up the big day zero day in which they are planning on a massacre at their school zero day does not offer answers but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing they are shown to be surprisingly normal typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives and if we didn't know what they were planning we wouldn't expect a thing they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no one else knows about their plan br br the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future despite how this is a fictionalized movie one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold not so much in looks but in manner as someone who has researched columbine very extensively i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it br br the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen i was completely in shock after seeing it and its a feeling that stays around for a while it is very realistic and well done and it is very difficult to watch br br all in all zero day is an excellent movie and i think everyone should at least check it out in the past we have always simply branded killers psychopaths and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers
<START> this was a truly insipid film the performances are third rate and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with scriptwriting i needed a visual aid for my presentation so i figured why not use a clip boy was i wrong after searching my local video store i came upon this where it was suspiciously titled starstruck i thought what the hey and decided to give it a try well i was very unhappy with my results there was maybe one scene i could use and meanwhile i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick so i took this back and picked up ed wood there's a movie i can use as an example then again anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is starfucker
<START> this is a truly awful film what they have done is taken a tv show which was never aimed at young children given it the george lucas treatment i e ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience br br ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch especially when the models got blown up and the voice cast wasn't too bad br br this suffers from bad casting bad acting with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope ron cook as parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played after this travesty i wouldn't let frakes direct traffic br br the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters br br avoid this rubbish like the plague br br i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported
<START> the ogre doesn't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'demons 3' in order to help it sell better well the film is directed by lamberto bava the man behind the first two demons films and ogres and demons are somewhat alike in that they're both 'monsters' anyway but other than that this film has no connections to the other two films it is however rather good italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films and while it's not completely obvious it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement it's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there's a murderous ogre living in the basement br br the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant but for what it is this is certainly a very decent horror film lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well the central setting a large castle makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times such as the inferno style pool scene the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange particularly between the husband and wife there's not a great deal of bloodshed but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects the ogre itself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't get to see it very often we do boil down to a fitting if highly predictable ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended
<START> going berserk is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen period sure it's kinda low budget but it's a non stop comedic tour de force there are tons of memorable quotes for instance when his soon to be father in law asks him how much he earns candy says oh i pull down anywhere between thirty and eleven thousand dollars a year sir oh course it is candy's delivery that sells it just classic stuff eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker a clip of his horrible low budget movie kung fu u will have you rolling br br so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem i can't recommend this movie enough
