<START> mild spoilers contained herein i'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it br br jet li's movies fall into one of two categories shaolin period movies and movies set in modern day hong kong revolving around triads or triad like organizations each genre has its best and worst films twin warriors' is jet li's best shaolin era flick while the evil cult' is his worst fist of legend' while in the recent past is the best modern era' jet li movie black mask' without a doubt is the worst br br jet li plays a self exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life span in his new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian when his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage jet li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them he dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian as well as to conceal his true identity to his ex comrades in arms br br the version i saw was dubbed and horribly at that why does jet li capture and hold hostage his library co worker if he's a pacifist is there a love story between them why does the police chief not care when he learns of the black mask's true identity the plot is just plain bad bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a half explained story i quickly lost interest in br br the action and martial arts sequences are way over the top lots of blood gore severed body parts aplenty explosions and matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie black mask' delivers for the rest of us jet li fans it is a true disappointment this is one of those movies where jet li never gets to be jet li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability br br normally a chinese knockoff of ozzy osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film sadly black mask' proved to be an exception to that rule indeed the antagonist of this movie by the way he dresses his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged ozzy osbourne however the villain isn't on screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile i am assuming the likeness to ozzy was intentional in addition to the villain's look he also ran a satanic looking hideout so much more could have been made from the ozzy osbourne villain gimmick if only the writer director or anyone had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film's arch villain br br black mask' was the first jet li film released on video in the usa after lethal weapon 4 and i'm glad i stayed away from it until now it may well have ruined my whole perception of jet li as a martial artist and actor if you want to see jet li at his worst rent black mask' and the evil cult' and make it a double feature or horror both intentional and unintentional otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of jet li and have plots that are semi well thought out and plausible 3 9 stars
<START> contains spoilers br br i saw an advert for this on a video then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it i rented the video on the same day i finished the book i thought it was very memorable as was the book the cast was brilliant tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur the costumes music and settings are stunningly beautiful br br warning don t read any more if you haven t watched this br br on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence this is why the video is rated 15 there are some other things that have been thrown in after the first part i felt that the accuracy went downhill while the book is better than this i am glad i have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book are fans of bronte or like costume dramas i am all 3 as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes the book is rather underated anne brontes books don t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane erye or wuthering heights which have made it into television and film several times another thing when i read the book i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it but here they had axed that all out br br 7 10
<START> br br in anticipation of ang lee's new movie crouching tiger hidden dragon i saw this at blockbuster and figured i'd give it a try a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch luckily though i had a good feeling about this director this movie was wonderfully written the dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie toby maguire was awesome i thought he was good but nothing special in pleasantville but here he shines i have always thought of skeet ulrich as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well the big shocker for me was jewel she was amazingly good jeffrey wright who i had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa this movie had the perfect combination the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others it lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting the plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing this was also a beautifully shot movie the scenery was not breath taking it's in missouri and kansas for goodness sakez but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an elegance which is very pleasant on the eyes the movie was deep it told a story and in doing so made you think it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out it was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done if you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie take a chance on it
<START> let's start this review out on a positive note i am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring actually creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite we don't actually know if tony will live or die he's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none this episode seemed to move very slow and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed asian monks slapping the sh t out of him was absolutely flat out weird after 45 minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving but that shouldn' t be a reason to slam this episode it was a weird and unpredictable episode but it was still well written and intense edie falco gave an astounding career defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could be demise i also found it interesting aj dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against junior which aj most likely won't have the balls to pull off silvio is now acting boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes there were a lot of great quips in this episode also and i think vito 'pole smoker' spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy s o b br br this wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show this was a necessary episode for the series even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion kudos to edie falco's performance and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist this is the only season of 'the sopranos' where i haven't a f cking clue where it is going to go i can't wait for next week's episode my rating 7 5 10 br br best line of the episode paulie to aj let's go van helsing
<START> i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right br br wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the end br br at times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed br br it's worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around br br i completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf
<START> guy is a loser can't get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i'd have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i'll be nice br br 3 10
<START> what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the storyline is ridiculous real human action laughable acting non existent and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are archaic i thought it must have been made around '80 '84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 that's 5 years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think 'what's the point ' it looks totally unbelievable i wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other
<START> i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the 10 and bought it now i understand why its so rare this film is so bad so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines are literally the movie's highlight the film is about a psychic pettyjohn cast for one obvious reason her topless scene whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it and gee what do you know surprise a kid in a foam rubber monster costume pops out instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face then escapes to a nearby city but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own but no matter this movie blows all its credibility long before then this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs somebody needs to alert the producers of mystery science theater 3000 if they don't know about it already 2 out 10 really really bad
<START> animation always seems to be fringe in japan this might not be the case but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat kids tag on it france is probably one of the more comic liberal countries home of classics as tin tin asterix lucky luke valereon and so on if you've never read these it's not too late there's no upper age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd stigma of dc or marvel it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france it suits my prejudiced image of the french as art loving anti usa oriented and talented movie makers luckily there's also a scanner darkly out there to suppress that view seems art is pretty much international br br anyway as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french if you're a normal person you will get scared by this there's no need for that however beneath it's cool sleek cel shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall br br that was one of my fears for this movie it's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick much like sony c o are doing with their pixar rip offs i was expecting a confusing sometimes boring and not very engaging movie but luckily i was wrong br br i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo noir stuff but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well note i've seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see english might be more interesting what with craig and everything br br a final word of praise to the animation it was awesome futuristic well crafted nice camera work smart solutions eyes for example looked very good which is hard to do and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out this is so damn impressive then again i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down so my verdict is a bit biased br br good movie anyway definitely lives beyond it's gimmick
<START> no plot crappy acting and pointless gore br br this is supposed to be a horror movie there's no fear or suspense just boom bang gore then done some kinda marines are in the desert for some weird crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie which was good and should have been left it at that br br this is just another excuse for money and use of pointless violence just like the saw sequels they know no matter how pointless the plot is and the more gore they can add people will see it i miss good suspenseful horror movies come on hollywood you can do much much better
<START> the emotional powers and characters of dominick and eugene are the things that hollywood doesn't make anymore this is one of the most emotional sensitive and heart felt movies that i have ever seen roy liotta tom hulce and supporting actress jamie lee curtis deliver oscar winning caliber performances there are not enough words to express how great this movie is sure people who are not into sentimental movies may not care as much as the rest of us about dominick and eugene but for the rest of us this movie goes right to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity you will never forget this film ever br br spoilers below br br the simple yet eloquent story is masterfully told eugene is a med school intern who faces long hours and a demanding work load at the hospital his fraternal twin brother dominick born 12 minutes earlier is a little slow and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by their father a heartbreaking moment when this is found out in the film that will leave you in tears eugene a k a geno faces a painful dilemma he must decide whether to finish medical school which would mean accepting his residency in another city and leave dominick a k a nicky behind or forfeit the rest of his education to take care of him nicky helps pay his brother's med school tuition by working as a trash collector br br the questions of ethics morals and responsibilities are masterfully blended in this landmark movie just when gino thinks nicky might be making progress toward independence dominick turns around and winds up doing things like helping out a drug dealer or tying to use a faulty cord that he finds at the dump on an electrical appliance br br larry is the character and nicky's partner on his garbage route who fills gullible dominick's head with all kinds of stories like geno and jennifer his girlfriend whom he is tutoring in clinical pharmacology going to atlantic city and gambling away all their money but deep down you can see that larry cares for him on their rounds nicky also befriends a little boy whom we find out has also been beaten by his father an end result is also tragic and the pain that you see on nicky's face when it happens speaks volumes br br the sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be overstated enough all nicky wants to do is be loved and look for acceptance in anyway he can i e he goes to church loves hulk hogan geno loves nicky more than anything in the world but can his brother become independent enough so that geno can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor a brilliant film that should have gotten tons more recognition than it deserved but unfortunately came out around the same time as rain man which dealt with a similar issue however i like dominick and eugene better because it has a far stronger emotional component be forewarned that this movie is aimed right at the tear ducts so have kleenex handy what a film
<START> i am a guy who loves guy movies i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects all of this happened however this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life br br the story was standard but the portrayal of the story was terrible the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger the serpent dragon's actions itself was very poorly written and the serpent dragon's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie several times the main characters should have died br br the director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times this movie was obviously not watched after it was made i love movies but had to force myself to finish watching it thank god i did not buy this i borrowed it from a friend br br do not buy this do not rent it just watch discovery channel much more exciting
<START> though i never like to be the sort of person who negates another's personal taste if you like something that's fine but this movie was horrible and there is no way around it i don't like ani difranco too much but she's a great guitarist and songwriter that i can admit but i can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face maybe but everything is portrayed too far fetched there seems to be an attempt at a naked gun esque kind of comedy but the timing is off there is too much space between each actors line as if they're holding for laughter there wasn't any whoever wrote the script was all over the place they tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film almost never fully developing any of them especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen
<START> the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy step into the shoes of agent 007 frwl comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real james bond no offense to pierce brosnan who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to eon but sean connery was the original james bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool br br i must say at this point like many others who have reviewed this game that sean 70 year old voice doesn't fit his 30 year old image on screen and this takes some getting used to but it's certainly worth it he makes lines like bondÂ james bond and shaken not stirred into a big deal again but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is as bond said in octopussy only the tip of the tentacle the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel it's the original gun barrel from the movies then you take on first mission rescuing the prime minister's hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond right down to the classic rock n roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game as bond infiltrates a secret factory br br after the game's opening the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie frwl james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him in turkey bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey bond must retrieve the device protect the damsel in distress and get both safely back to london bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script and he's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie the characters from the movie are all recreated well but some are better than others the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny and there's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny m and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 movies br br what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games besides sir sean's voice and likeness is two notable features in the game play one is bond focus while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death the other notable feature is the stealth and mÃªlÃ©e kills when you're in close enough range just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connery's james bond displayed br br sean connery's bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent so you only have a few gadgets but they're good ones the q copter is a remote control helicopter that can self destruct and explore areas bond can't reach like the q spider in eon only better the classic laser watch is useful not just for getting into sealed rooms but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with but you must experience them for yourself besides the gadgets you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game including the gray suit from the movie the standard black tuxedo a retro stealth suit and that classic white tuxedo all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies when you drive in the game you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of goldfinger it can't turn invisible but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie and when you're not flying down the streets of istanbul in the goldinger car you can fly through the air in the thunderball jet pack br br then there's the multi player of course it has to be compared to the standard of the goldeneye game and it fails also you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game but the multi player is amusing and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing the basic game does have other flaws some of the movie's most exciting moments particularly the gypsy camp shootout bond's brawl with red grant on the orient express and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebb's bladed shoe aren't done justice in game form and the game is a fast play even on the hardest difficulty but overall this game is the best james bond experience so far
<START> in all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made for tv movie having said that homicide the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well it's all very bitter sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide story wise i found this film somewhat lacking giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as leiutenant also det bayliss's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after h lots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series now if they'd just release it on dvd
<START> hmmm where to start how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap first blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits point of course if you are interested in the crapstory demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals that is the most stupid clichÃ© one i can think of you'll say gi jane is a great movie just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell i can't think of demi moore being rambo especially not during the last useless 30 minutes ridley scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it's just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it awful movie
<START> another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre successful and not in varying degrees br br buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary and very active demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment while not at the forefront buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie much like kurosawa's ran it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it's nowheres near ran's league br br stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length the lead actors are uniformly excellent the music is really good the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close ups this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat another recent film like this is tsui hark's seven swords great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing asano really doesn't move like a sword wielding demon his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene br br good movie you'll probably find it interesting just don't expect traditional sword fights
<START> there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war take a look at this one br br i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle no one quite sure where that shot came br br and they nicked one scene to saving private ryan so it has to have some merit in the scene br br
<START> this had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i'm 64 years old and a football fan i went expecting to see a football movie about 10 minutes into it i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie particularly the acting could have gotten into a theater about half way through i whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie although i was a little offended and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian at being preached to in a movie theater it wasn't that big a deal it was however a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and above all the quality of the acting it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater do i go to church yes do i want to go to church when i attend a movie no would i recommend this movie absolutely not
<START> as a grownup in my mid 40s i am not even close to any of nancy drew 's key demographics but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon so i could tell were the pair of sixtyish silver haired ladies down the row from me the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20 ish female usher who said she'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it br br more to the point however in the row just ahead of me there were nine count them nine ten year old girls lined up next to each other passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews br br once the film began they promptly settled down to watch br br and didn't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll br br this is not a perfect film it doesn't quite pay off its high school subplots it's not quite confident enough of its own tone and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times but the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful the plot hangs together fairly well and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization last but not least emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace josh flitter's superb timing notwithstanding this is roberts' movie and she pulls it off beautifully her nancy drew is very much the direct ancestor of kristen bell's veronica mars and the film is also a lineal descendant of jodie foster's early and underrated candleshoe br br in today's marketplace it's a rarity a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence as such it won't be to everyone's taste but for what it is it is the best movie of its kind in decades
