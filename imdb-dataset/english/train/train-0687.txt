<START> the subject this latest adman turned movieman tries to tackle in his debut ad venture is quite an age old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard timeless romance pun intended br br however the exploration and exploitation for desi auds falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper spice and sugar' up the usual masala mix of b g score dialog dance drama etc creates a nice looking package with not much inside br br in the first 40 minutes of the movie the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8 9 times further repeats follow thru out the movie after all the lead character's a cook but therein lies les problemos no story hah no wonder someone forgot to write a script br br amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada more amount of over acting really when is this guy ever gonna stop how many 60 somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30 something timeless mind yes but surely what about the not so ageless bod and sole sorry soul reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new fangled discovery of a hot new idea nowhere are we presented with any real life problems or issues such a pair might face other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle the sub plot of a little kid with cancer the bachelor boy's first love goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl's character br br anyway nice try but not quite there yet
<START> vampyres br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format mono br br a motorist murray brown is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women marianne morris and anulka and becomes enmeshed in their free spirited sexual lifestyle but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood br br taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director jean rollin in france and consolidated by the success of hammer's carmilla series in the uk jose ramon larraz' daring shocker vampyres pushed the concept of adult horror much further than british censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974 and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original british release it isn't difficult to see why using its gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time will allow larraz who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym 'd daubeney' uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life death and the impulses sexual and otherwise which affirm the human condition br br shot on location at a picturesque country house during the autumn of 1973 harry waxman's haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding in which the desolate countryside bleak and beautiful in equal measure seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with symptoms a low key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel however despite its pretensions vampyres' wafer thin plot and rough hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished the male lead brown past his prime at the time of filming is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud a must see item for cult movie fans an amusing curio for everyone else vampyres is an acquired taste watch out for silent era superstar bessie love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie
<START> contrary to what those who hate christianity the 700 club provides real answers as well as inspiration it also provides reliable news logical commentary and a different view than what abc cbs nbc and pbs thinks is best unlike other programs which provide social and faith related commentary those who are behind the 700 club provide help for those in need such as feeding the hungry with operation blessing providing medical help to those living in poverty stricken communities and giving hope to those who need hope it's not at all hateful if the 700 club offends you i suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel on your tv set i do the same thing when i find cnn headline news or for that matter programs which i find biased or offensive what i find offensive is the way that the abc family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the 700 club do not reflect those of abc family
<START> the plot was predictable and fighting with guns gets old but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don't really care about real movies i would endulge in true art movies like 'clerks' 'something about mary' 'el mariachi' or 'la taqueria'
<START> this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future very natural acting for such young ones i don't know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good but no the less excellent bill scored as far as i'm concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr paxtons bad acting what can one do in that role he played the part rather well in my opinion this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good the ethan hawke version wow do not listen to his comments great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable if that's what you want cinematography gets an above the average rating also
<START> this is a very strange hk film in many ways first many of the action sequences really aren't that much fun the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly that's not to say there aren't some great action scenes but most simply don't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen the opposite side is that this film actually has characters not just people all of the main characters are interesting except for the head bad guy who is flat as a billiard table and most are fairly well acted all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch the dialogue is quite witty and doesn't seem to lose much in translation this film is worth seeing but i hope that uninitiated american audiences don't think this is the best hk has to offer
<START> i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a rip off of the big chill but with the all star cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a rip off almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old place cabin camp kimberly williams meg tilly jerk womanizer matt craven jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why i'm even watching these people there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them how did unca lou even find these characters after 20 years plus it wasn't even funny except when perkins fell err 'flopped' out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film are you sleeping over there she replied no i'm still thinking no none i can think of
<START> i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning while waiting for my laundry how ironic mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin frankel's title music again i ended up sitting through about the first half hour entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction writing and performances are the movie is like a who's who of 50s british character stars cecil parker michael gough miles malleson duncan lamont and particularly ernest thesiger great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood not character players as such but charming charismatic leads this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well an all time classic and i hope no one ever tries to remake it
<START> i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a 5 i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film br br the storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going what's happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable oh no it's dark look out behind you i say quite bored with the cheap thrills br br the plot even though predictable was intriguing that is until the end this was good until the end then it just got silly says jack skellington freke on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilers br br see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how unrealistic how dull br br 3 10 come on lionsgate you've had amazing films but this one sunk
<START> take this movie for what it is not a remake but a completely different approach to the same concept it's not an epic like the original it's more of a popcorn thriller visually it's incredible everything else was just ok br br for what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b c of this movie it wasn't supposed to be a remake and it's not br br the ending was cool i took it as a parallel universe
<START> night of the comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet instead of watching the light show regina belmont catherine mary stewart decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist larry dupree michael bowen in his booth they awake the next morning as larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked killed by a zombie the same zombie attacks regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister samantha kelli maroney they desperately search for more survivors meet up with a long distance trucker named hector gomez robert beltran meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust they're on the look out for unwilling donors br br written directed by thom eberhardt i found night of the comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience i'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on imdb about it because i just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential the script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of earth a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course there are plot holes too if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments killing them just seemed a totally bizarre an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure it just doesn't make sense i mean if your going to die you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two i'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other i mean what are the odds on that when hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took regina before she committed suicide so how did hector know these things i also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace became incredibly boring dull to watch after hearing so many good things about it night of the comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap br br director eberhardt does a really good job i liked the look of the film with it's red tinted sky he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets there are constant montage's of empty streets deserted roads abandoned buildings it gets extremely repetitive dull ok we get it there's no one else about so there's no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them the zombies are totally wasted there are two zombie attacks in the entire film that's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes night of the comet pays homage or rips off whichever you prefer several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from dawn of the dead 1978 forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any br br technically night of the comet is pretty good the special effects are decent enough the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off the acting was alright expect for maroney as samantha the air head blonde who became highly irritating br br night of the comet was a big disappointment for me i had hoped for so much more persoanlly i found this film dull boring uneventful the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of 'girls just wanna have fun' is probably the worst moment in the film really bad i just don't get why so many people like this i'm sure i'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin i can take it
<START> geez another lifetime movie but once again isn't exactly the worst movie in the world but far from the best i think the main problem is that it's pretty obvious who is responsible for what and it's generally fairly predictable worse yet some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing and the viewer is left wondering okay how much am i supposed to care one thing i did like is that the movie goes to show you that it's never that simple as the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad and sometimes it is evil vs evil rather than good vs evil hadley didn't do what she did out of a sense of justice she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family and to eliminate the competition as for alicia it simply proves that a victim isn't always a good person some of them really do have it coming even if it was a painful horrible death the burning bed is a great example of this but the difference is that the vile man in the burning bed got exactly what he deserved but did alicia have it coming some will say that she did but others don't agree and the law generally doesn't either br br as for acting it's a mixed bag some do a good job like mia but others just came across as indifferent to their roles they were mostly wooden or simply not convincing the music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy especially if you like girl girl action the movie isn't badly shot at all but given its glaring weaknesses the strengths are in background unfortunately br br i've heard rumors of a sequel but given the years i doubt it'll happen but i wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared if alicia is as evil conniving and horrible as people say then i don't think she'll be thinking yay i woke up from a coma oh hadley was responsible oh that's okay i totally forgive her and want the charges dropped no way hadley would be in jail for long anyway if she even does any time since no murder actually happened br br anyway worth checking out at least once
<START> i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing this film wasn't worth the memorex dvd r it was burned on i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder this is by far the worst movie ever made i truly from the bottom of my heart want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life br br so apparently it's supposed to be bad on purpose however if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90 minute coil of doo doo you'll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick the actors attempt dramatic kick ass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marine br br the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg the camera angles are awful the story is c movie at best the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b movie caliber the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies plus the techno score is annoying not because it's techno but because it's non stop that's right the music plays in the background the whole time acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is i don't care what the disclaimer claims i don't buy it bots was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself way too serious for what it was a joke br br this film was very low budget but that is no excuse for its record setting suck factor great films are born of substance not budget bots had neither br br allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90 minute waste of time if i were having a three way with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on i'd be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decision br br undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie two maybe three they'll say it's grindhouse chop socky or cheesy in a good way or it's so bad it's good those people are idiots a movie is either good or it's bad there's no such thing as a good bad movie but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies don't get me wrong there are lots of cornball not to be taken seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining slither is one bots is not br br this suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long the best thing about this film is the dvd cover so next time you're near the wal mart dvd bargain bin take a look at it don't touch it just look and quietly walk away
<START> i found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romero's 'dead' trilogy to '28 days later ' however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really is br br it is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some half way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe you're dvd player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie it's a pity i think anyone could find a better use for 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud though some of the 360 effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different character br br also what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game i've played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh that's right this isn't a movie but a music video and it's a poor one at that 3 10 br br rated r a lot of violence gore and profanity
<START> the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote poised to flick around to watch something else the premise of two writers down on their luck living in a self storage space bin was mildly amusing but painfully bland br br the introduction of the character played by joe pantoliano the big deal movie guy that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director borderline nymphomaniac added a bit of spice her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye candy inclusion br br ultimately the obvious low budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget whithnail i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream but down on their luck br br however for my money the actors save tinseltown from the terrible movie archives and just about nudges it into the could have been a cult movie archives i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantoliano's character in particular the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichÃ©d but still funny rich but screwed up characters house where the story unravels towards it's final moments br br i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film makers did their best to translate this to celluloid it simply didn't work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything br br unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket
<START> i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family br br i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions br br the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create br br i found the film to be delightful
<START> the characters at depth less rip offs you've seen all the characters in other movies i promise the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field completely forced and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked the hot chick is old and has no personality shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between molly the hot chick and kirk the dorky love interest is barely communicated the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt mishap kiss occurs afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super bad esquire movie with a semi appealing plot i could compare this to the hangover in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just don't pay to see this movie
<START> if any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills this is probably the one i've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag about br br i have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and i've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him deepti naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn't have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didn't have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role br br one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they won't brag too much about it after wards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see
<START> lawrence olivier and merle oberon did two movies together within two years one is considered one of the great romantic films of all time and the movie that made olivier a great movie star and gave oberon her best performance role wuthering heights the other is this film made in england a year earlier the divorce of lady x is a romantic comedy as wuthering heights is a romantic tragedy olivier is a lawyer everard logan who is a dynamic barrister but is also a total misogynist one night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people it is a very foggy night the type of pea soup fog that london was known for up until a notorious killer fog in the 1950s and the crowd who'd been attending a party in the hotel need beds the management tries to get logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms but he refuses but he has not reckoned with merle oberon as leslie steele the granddaughter of a high court judge she manages to get into logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there but appropriates his bed he goes onto the couch much to his discomfort br br the next day they share a breakfast and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women logan finds leslie very attractive but she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name she is determined to learn more about him and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating in the meantime logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman ralph richardson as lord mere as a potential client mere suspects his wife lady mere binnie barnes of having an affair in fact he tells logan her ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that logan knows he was in on the night of the fog logan naturally jumps to the conclusion that lady mere was his mysterious roommate that night i will not go into the plot any further except to say that leslie eventually realizes what a mistake logan has made and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women br br the script has the feel of a wodehouse novel but is slighter still the performances of olivier oberon richardson barnes and morton selden as oberon's grandfather are all splendid it shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what i mean selden's first scene complaining about his weak coffee to his butler valet who tells him off properly they've been used to each other's personalities for years or olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office who is certain there were two lady meres in the office two minutes before there were but oberon and barnes left together and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man as i said a slight charming comedy but it is very charming
<START> after eight moto films the series had run its course as this last entry demonstrates peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of moto and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a funny british sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here
