<START> what to say about this movie well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever though that is not fair some people like troma's movies and they can watch it if they want troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity
<START> what do you do with a 14 inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder and then died of aids you make a movie of course the probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production so it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prison br br the best thing about the movie is its quick pace there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap and why would it be there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes the cast is good kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies so here was finally a role quite suitable for him bosworth is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts she's solid and mcdermott who is otherwise quite annoying is rather good to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didn't recognize him at first i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldn't have to watch his dumb face i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate and wouldn't have known she was in it had i not seen her name in the end credits kudrow is charming as ever a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role btw friends is the worst tv sitcom of all time the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo you thought i'd include paris hilton too didn't you no i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a dumb whore because the film is about decadence among other things Â and about a porn actor Â she fits in perfectly
<START> the movie was watchable while nicolson was on the screen however i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack she was as bland as could be the relationship between the characters was nothing special these characters have been portrayed before and much better it felt like a based on real life scenario in the absolute worst sense 90 of daily life is boring and not worth writing about or watching why ephron felt her life and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me perhaps she wrote it as therapy for many writers putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic fine but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me
<START> for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls think again there is a totally different side to the japanese animation yakitate japan is one of those shows it is a sweet natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads the show is as wacky as they come and i'm sure that non japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show br br in the world of yakitate it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers from time traveling to swimming like a fish that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i've watched in a while
<START> watching der himmel Ã¼ber berlin as a teen in the late 80's was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of wim wenders br br unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clichÃ©s and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience br br has the well run dry whatever the reason it's time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
<START> this movie is good it's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good first thing first the story is actually good the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool my problem is theres too many characters it got very confusing when they switched scenes the special effects were incredible the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex this movie practically all computer generated the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist loner character zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening the music is also excellent to me this story deserve at least a mini series and not just one movie theres too much story to cram in 2 hours maybe if there was a book or something i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details this movie sacrifices story integrity for action i reccomend storm riders over this any day
<START> i really looked forward to seeing nana after seeing renoir amazing debut work whirlpool of fate i had read that nana was generally considered his best silent film so i had high hopes sadly this felt like a huge step backwards br br catherine hessling is the main problem with this film her acting is over the top even for a silent film her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens not the late 20s she usually has the same face which reminds me sorry to say of someone with constipation pains it was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale there was nothing charming about her at all br br the film was also quite long drawn the camera work was uninteresting aside from a shot of a horse race and the editing was dull the story reminded me of pabst's pandora's box it is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films pandora's box simply scores on every level where nana fails br br this film is only for renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs
<START> i've given up trying to figure out what version of this i'm watching the copyright at the end indicates 1983 and though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling extremely unsettling br br my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute as a button pamela franklin alive how dare they br br seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i've seen her in this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house they kill her off br br i would like to put the film industry on notice pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside br br no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it i am quite cross the fury has been unleashed br br for b movie fans seeking out a crapfest you could do much worse than this on the plus side this is not a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way this movie is a hardcore satanic film br br wall to wall satanic ceremonies baphomets hallucinations a ludicrous rat attack what else could you ask for br br this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted on 1980s synth soundtrack which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be the soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on the equalizer it's really bad br br also they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent which was also quite rude if not a cruel atrocity against the viewer such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice who's with me i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn't abuse pamela franklin and so i throw the gauntlet down sirs anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with me br br even in a fictional context br br good day sirs
<START> here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non slow motion scenes this film needed to be sped up if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i've certainly seen all of them do better ben johnson's always a joy though i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later
<START> good action and interesting plot having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie good cast meaningful acting although it would nice to see some more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7 10 is a right vote i think
<START> not the worst movie i've seen but definitely not very good either i myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change the movie portrays similar qualitys first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags autocockers one guy sporting a bushy not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy a bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals br br so what exactly is wrong with the movie well the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie wouldn't be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy the perception of paintball is pretty bad too they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is to be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not respect and playing by the rules don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1
<START> add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer sophie tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers it only makes it worse br br contemptible burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day it's extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldn't have been offended i don't think that i'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an 11 year old white boy however i might not have understood some of it
<START> i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it i'm sure it will ruin it a choice treat all the way around other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and don't miss this gem call it what you like i call it two hours of entertainment well spent read my lips don't miss it
<START> for a fan series i must admit that hidden frontier is not at all that bad but reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not the initiative in itself is commendable the creativity as well i reckon these are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek but doing all this work pulling all these resources taking all this time and still all those flaws br br first of all the acting and the lines are awful for most the dialogs belongs in a 70's military show not in star trek the captain mr squinty looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime and most characters are just reading their lines the directors should be aware of the fact that retake is not just a word in the dictionary but i also guess that the series are made in the manner of two takes frakes who directed many of the tng episodes and movies also i could not help but think that most of the actors are typical trekkies without going any deeper into that assumption br br my biggest concern regarding the whole project is the quality of the releases when they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series why didn't they make it available in decent quality using the quick time format with low low resolution is a waste of talent even the higres episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in using xvid codec with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively if band with problems was the issue setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that br br let's hope the crew decides to brush the series up and perhaps release it on dvd giving it the quality the project deserves
<START> when originally screened in america in 1972 'the night stalker' became the highest rated made for t v movie in history based on jeff rice's unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak the late darren mcgavin discovered the existence of a vampire in modern day las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen br br i did not know of the existence of 'the night strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later i t v who screened the 'kolchak' movies had apparently decided to pass on the spin off series they felt 'barnaby jones' starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse 'kolchak' with 'kojak' for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels br br then something wonderful happened in 1990 b b c 2 put out the show as part of a late night friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'mystery train' hosted by richard o'brian 'kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'the brain eaters' and 'earth vs the spider' the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchak's whistling and the closing credits well there were none br br the first episode screened was 'werewolf' i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i did br br i really wish i'd seen it in 1974 my twelve year old self would have adored it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris carter's imagination br br the show's biggest asset was of course mcgavin unlike the recent kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what 'columbo' was to crime the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak's bad tempered boss tony vincenzo the scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt bereft br br 'the x files' came along a few years later and filled the void but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never revived though without oakland it would not have been the same br br i have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first in his book 'danse macabre' as it is as good as anything he has written br br alright so some of the monsters were hardly state of the art but so what the new 'kolchak' totally missed the point of the original what you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do br br best episode 'horror in the heights' worst episode 'the sentry'
<START> i couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007 it had all the looks of a below average seventies horror flick didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didn't they know that in the post millennium the violence in a supposed horror and or scifi movie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesn't really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts br br first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time that's totally unprofessional and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy like normal dark eyes couldn't they have waited for such a specimen the story is lame it's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye transplants which suddenly makes him feel like the donor wolf or at least that's what i make of it and then he's being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with night vision eye sight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient it's beyond me why they're out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient a volunteering soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor aaron isn't that a bit steep who the hell are these militaries anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like psychopaths walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy 1 and displaying during the ultimate show down in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren panicking and shooting randomly around br br aaron for some unfathomable medical reason feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor wolf are situated in it's eye balls and that the recipient of these eye balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all fours like a cat can a wolf even do that br br the acting or the lack thereof didn't help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one love scene i really sympathized with actor cory monteith who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didn't give him much to go with he has to run around bare chested for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique monteith really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern sci fi horror the only good acting came from justine bateman and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty something lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a wimp who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries what a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more br br in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goings on a lot of overlong national geographic like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all
<START> that 'malcom' show on fox is really making a killing can't we do our own version i speculate and paraphrase of course but in our hearts we all know it's true and that the only thing nbc added to the 'malcom' metric was sex and boy did they add sex br br thirteen year old tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window and this is all in the pilot br br take it from a grown man a boy's puberty is so sex crazy and testicle driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies and you can count those on one hand so it's no surprise that tucker has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty isn't this the stuff people go to jail for if you doubt the show's depravity consider this 13 episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only 4 episodes aired they then made the unprecedented move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them ironic since kids were originally the target audience br br apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voice over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing even in 2000 it was horribly dated with it's ska incidental music and super sarcasm i couldn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't exactly come a mile a minute shame on nbc for this dirty rip off they're better than that br br grade c
<START> this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and homophobic all at once while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of two scenes were especially offensive the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man could it really have been that gross and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech's best friend who is pretending to be russian after he leaves the room she exclaims f king foreigners so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris br br jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good looking it's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia
<START> they're not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allen's writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allen's match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness br br allen as director and actor can't hide his love for the actress as he couldn't for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen quips i'd be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class
<START> i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in english it seems in cambodia the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop's partner is killed the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about wai's erratic behavior he doesn't know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave pang doesn't speak chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man who's training the boys making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack there are many very brutal violent scenes the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot knives to the neck and torso guns fired directly to the head and several very intense beatings it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing
