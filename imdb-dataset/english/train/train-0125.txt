<START> i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit and his ocean's 11 director steven soderbergh worse we picked this up in a discount bin for 4 99 canadian dollars at that what a grand and pleasant surprise but then i'm of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can't be disappointed this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s ok with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut splittingly funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best 5 i've spent in ages
<START> this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of gable's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing it's a good movie but not one of their best
<START> this movie is terrible carlitos way 1993 is a great film goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done this movie should be considered closer to the sting part2 or maybe speed zone remember those gems the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original this movie lacked everything de palma pacino and penn worked so hard on there wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder after i watched this s t fest movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery
<START> randolph scott is leaving the usa for the greener pastures of canada's british columbia he wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner bill williams and cook lee tung foo they stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by victor jory later jory rustles their cattle and williams loses his left arm during the fracas br br from 1945 until 1962 when he retired randolph scott made a series of good adult themed westerns some of them considered real classics unfortunately the cariboo trail will never be listed among his best westerns br br it's more like the material that roy rogers or gene autry might use the story is downright silly at times williams who was along for the ride with scott he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time he doesn't blame the rustlers he blames scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm br br also there's a scene in the film when scott lee tung foo and gabby hayes are captured by indians they escape because gabby's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the indians allowing our heroes to escape i'm not sure that would have played in a rogers film br br furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector randolph scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector gabby hayes on how to find gold br br this was gabby hayes's farewell feature film part it would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with randolph scott before this br br i will say this though no caribou made any appearance in the film this is one of the few canadian locale films from the past that did not have any mounties br br but if i were you unless you are a big fan of randolph scott or gabby hayes take the next detour off the cariboo trail
<START> buford's beach bunnies gives b grade t a films a bad name as a fan of the genre i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think
<START> the story line was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts behavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john turtorro doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi autistic chess player not to speak of the italian player motives weren't very much outlined either br br
<START> i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of and those i found made this one look unmissable how misled i feel br br firstly it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie the performances are wooden every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are and it is based in that predictable and well trodden premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and incompassionate the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension br br if that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you then be warned linda hamilton's german accent while quite good is painfully distracting as is her face for some reason the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day there are few surprises but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks br br i wasn't expecting action but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all br br watch it under the folowing circumstances 1 there's nothing else on 2 you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies 3 the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film 4 you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling
<START> h g wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935 very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades great cast includes raymond massey arsenic and old lace sir cedric hardwick ghost of frankenstein ralph richardson time bandits and margaretta scott early glimpses of helicopters holograms a rocket ship and futuristic cities this film was ahead of its time directed by william cameron menzies invaders from mars its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis 1927 but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come that was made in 1979 this movie has nothing to do with the original h g wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories a classic science fiction movie 10 out of 10
<START> i had a recent spectator experience with the perfect witness 2007 because the netflix computer recommendation engine suggested i watch this film apparently at some point i told it how much i liked michael haneke's benny's video i don't know about you but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over thomas c dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse just this kind of recommendation from the netflix computer intelligence for me had the aesthetic moral movie bar set to level so high that upon reflection it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007 br br having prefaced my response to the film that way i'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal and i really hate to do that because i think our boy wes bentley happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the us i'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this br br the perfect witness is about micky wes bentley who about thirty still lives with mom you're not drinkin' again area ya's but he's a filmmaker or at the very least some kind of street level voyeur with a pension for shooting would be johns in the seedy back alleys of philadelphia with his dvx 100b out there doing his private investigator like drills micky inadvertently video tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early twenty ish coed with his hand held camcorder baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films micky approaches the assailant james lemac mark borkowski also takes a writing credit or mac the knife Âwhichever and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police br br the problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do while both the writing and direction are amateurish that alone doesn't make a film bad it's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little mac or pc no film relies on shock value alone any more unless of course ironically it's a film about torture on animals and therefore cinematic images of violence real or fake have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes also we've got this astounding actor talent in the lead all styled up real hip guy his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it backwards just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest Âsame guy who just now calls himself a poet br br spare me i'm an artist i'm a filmmaker okay please do carry on with that shtick cronnie seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock and go ahead you can wear all the accrutements of a creative but don't expect us top respond to you to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down wes bentley's career why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do filmmaker guy my guess is history will eventually have say something about that Âlike probably that's in not is good as you think it is and yeah odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma end up like our man micky here in the perfect witness hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand great
<START> how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck i just don't get it trick or treat managed to do it this sucks and likes it br br trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about it is a vomit inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself trick or treat has no redeeming factors br br for a movie about heavy metal it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986 probably one of heavy metal's strongest hours that is quite a feat however negative br br trick or treat so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film
<START> summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week given 99 9 of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown i'm hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasn't for tashan br br after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like it's literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesn't have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 both of which i enjoyed tremendously br br in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you can't fault his direction you'd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom 2 homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere br br at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor who's not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmy's services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah beng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business br br so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non green incredible hulk with his gravity defying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha male and played in ra ra mode each time he takes on adversaries br br but sad to say that's the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan pandey bachchan pandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasn't able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all usually the song dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach front br br tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole
<START> ok people honestly this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that's ever been made but i've been laughing myself silly which may be why i enjoyed it basically it's all about sex sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment watch this movie when you get the chance and don't have something better to do br br attention spoilers the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat on the show and flashing his wallet with his love's pictures a triple a for bad taste and fun
<START> all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains although the children were much more sadistic in scctm i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie as a spanish assignment in spanish 5 we all had to watch it i'll tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr pitch was going to do next would merlin help santa claus or would his robot reindeer come and save the day i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that d
<START> i love don knotts let me just say that up front he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is portray a nervous lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority he is fabulous in this role as roy fleming the reluctant astronaut but the film is pretty dull really even though as a kid my brother and i delighted in watching this and his other films it's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children i'd categorize it as 100 family friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night br br as with all of knotts' films there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when knotts gives one of his shaky open mouthed stares no matter how old and jaded you are br br from an adult perspective one thing i think that is great about this film is how it captures nasa in the 1960s all the new modern buildings the hope the optimism the future and i was surprised at how suave and studly leslie neilsen was back then only complaint about the story is roy's love interest a rather threadbare unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot if you're like me you'll be hoping that he gives her the shove off at the end beware you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching it's that catchy
<START> sÃ¥ som in himmelen was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films i have seen in my life that it did not win the oscar i will not shed a tear this movie is in a kind of class of its own that an oscar win would possibly have detracted from it my dearest friend anders nyberg you have done true magnificence with your pen here kay pollak with your creation and everyone contributing you all have given a gift of love to our world between the points of entering this world of ours then exiting it you really can say that you made it better a special personal thank you from my soul to all of you that you brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life i grew up in sweden and my young mind and present beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful swedish influences individuals traditions music and nature my blessings with gratitude to you all with love and light george gabriel berkovits soulhealer johannesburg south africa
<START> national treasure 2004 is a thoroughly misguided hodge podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clichÃ© that has ever been written the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates how precious is that i ask you a seemingly normal fellow who for no other reason than being of a lineage of like minded misguided fortune hunters decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like indiana jones meets the patriot the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another Â attempting to create a 'stanley goodspeed' regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane but disconnected misadventures br br the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil and then going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout u s currency art work is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining couldn't washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country hence we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth ben's intentions are noble Â if confusing he's set on protecting the treasure for who and when Âyour guess is as good as mine br br but there are a few problems with ben's crusade first up his friend ian holmes sean bean decides that he can't wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives oh yeah Â brilliant idea presumably the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune so ian tries to kill ben the assassination attempt is of course unsuccessful if overly melodramatic it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up and pick on the very sultry curator of the archives abigail chase diane kruger she thinks ben is clearly a nut Â at least at the beginning but true to action romance form abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say is that the hope diamond the film moves into full x file ish mode as the fbi mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi layering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive honestly don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct in the final analysis national treasure isn't great film making so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies woven together from scraps the likes of which would make il' betsy ross blush br br the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors natural flesh tones solid blacks and clean whites the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements the audio is 5 1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made if only as an audience we had had more clarification as to why ben and co were chasing after an illusive treasure this might have been one good flick extras conclude with the theatrical trailer audio commentary and deleted scenes not for the faint hearted Â just the thick headed
<START> a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit run the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper how festive only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch so it's up to dad to say the day br br this late 70's made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail biter but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it's merely lame boring and not really well acted in the least bit br br my grade d
<START> i liked top gun it held my interest predictable plot decent character development and story line it is pretty similar to high noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain this movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles denver pyle was a good looking man in his younger days john dehner rod taylor are outstanding in their roles sterling hayden did the best that he could with poor material it is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger laura played by karen booth was a nauseating character she seemed flattered that two men may have been fighting over her ugh finally how can people travel without luggage especially women
<START> vanilla sky was a wonderfully thought out movie or rather abre los ojos was well thought out i watched that movie late one night excited about what was to come i wasn't disappointed by the end of the movie i was awstruck i couldn't get it off my mind the whole idea of it just blew me away the ending was more of a surprise than shyamalan could ever do the plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through the cast superb it was an all around wonderful movie the kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new i've seen it four or five times and i'm always finding something new it's a movie to keep you interested forever
<START> i haven't actually finished the film you may say that in this case i have no right to review it especially so negatively but i do only because i stopped it on account of i couldn't watch anymore i got over halfway and i only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner this film is so tiresome so lackluster that i was actually insulted i haven't read many of the other reviews so i'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it but i am homosexual and i did go through similar revelations day dreams issues etc etc there were maybe two moments where i actually felt this film could go somewhere where i felt it may have some inkling of meaning or relativity but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of clichÃ© ridden narration came on i mean just look at the quotes on the imdb page unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back nor the echo ey fades if you're just read the quotes because they are just too painful ridiculous stupid to miss i did give the film three stars and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform archer's tired concepts into something watchable mind you i pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of tv closeups another unnecessary clichÃ© already over done in films such as korine's gummo i think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at sundance only because archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did by the way because sundance seems to be the one festival where clichÃ© heavy drivel like this is still accepted as arthouse no it's not art house i'm afraid it's just plain s t house do not watch
