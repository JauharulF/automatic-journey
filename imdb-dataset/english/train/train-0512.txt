<START> a good deal of running around a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens along with his pretty wife he invades their territory and is given secrets about them he becomes rather traitorous in the process granted he is given little choice anyway there is a scene where he gives them everything they want this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens the plot isn't technically bad it's just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building this is what editing is all about i suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more not much here
<START> before i begin let me tell you how great this stand up special sounds when you play sonic adventure i dx director's cut at the same time red mountain level in particular so while watching this stand up special i suggest no demand you do it br br carlos mencia takes his stand up to the extreme in san francisco california there he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologies br br i am pretty much thanking god here that carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it i know a couple of times i said after carlos said a joke damn this guy makes a good point and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing sonic adventure i dx director's cut my bad so yeah there's nothing to complain about this stand up special if you have tivo or something like that please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour
<START> well i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees etc etc etc they go to that town which no one know it exists blah blah blah and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that movie i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it
<START> this was recently on amc's vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of voyage to the earth's core and mysterious island i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ogar a half idiot pre modern man who befriends the lost adventurers the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in people that time forgot don't waste your time
<START> the story of a woman ann on her death bed her two daughters nina and constance and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life br br first of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila's brother buddy br br now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose br br then we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out br br and the grandest problem of all why don't ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack come home to find out about buddy's tragic end and then br br nothing br br they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn't help but wondering why why the movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them br br the part of the story in the present is fairly boring the clichÃ© good daughter and the clichÃ© bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why i'm not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly it is really lame and embarrassing br br there are no mistakes ann advises at us the statement doesn't ring true with the story and it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors
<START> first up this film according to the slick said it won best film at worldfest film festival in houston texas hmmm must have been a quiet year br br wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader body melt but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on hi 8 video br br my guess is the film makers watched a lot of troma films and really bad b grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film br br don't get me wrong i love really low grade films just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy bad taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste br br if you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no budget film making watch it otherwise stay away

<START> i think i've seen worse films so i'm giving this a 3 but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly xtro nasty dull or possibly creep just plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse it's difficult to know where to start let's just say it's a poor man's under siege starring an even poorer man's jean claude van damme the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers yes he was johnny rico if you really want to know br br judging from this site he's been stuck in tv movie hell casper be more selective please arghhhhh i've just turned over and there's a half decent film on called criminal law now i'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1 5hrs
<START> the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless br br stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch which has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it br br you want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
<START> a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and fenway park as a baseball fan and light movie addict it hit a homerun for me plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past bosox failures and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage over the hill self serving kevin costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love struck couple suffering from jimmy's bosox jones it was a bit whacky and out of left field but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team the movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending although predictable had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies without being overly pretentious br br also enjoyable was the return of willie garson to the screen i miss the forever popular stanford blatch from sex the city he's always funny even when he does or says very little br br so buy yourself two box seats some popcorn and get ready for a fun time fever pitch is a winner
<START> this is the first american film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by europeans particularly the french and belgians for at least a decade and isn't it about time following three high school girls in the crown heights neighborhood of brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years it does what all good art should it discovers the universal in the particular even though the girls' preoccupations are outwardly conventional boys sex popularity money freedom and clothes we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped the universal interface between character and destiny br br the naturalism is whole complete the film breathes stays in the moment inhabits real time the story tells itself the medium and its artifacts for once are not the message the film unwaveringly truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters it does not impose its own adult meanings or morals details emerge of their own are never pushed and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of crown heights part of the largest black ghetto in new york city and one of the most dangerous violent places in the us the subject is childhood in the ghetto not the ghetto itself br br documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band the jackie robinson steppers punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color movement and sound otherwise the camera stays very close very intimate a patient sly and unobtrusive observer the language is rich spontaneous the acting transparent some scenes standout such as the girls lolling about each revealing her deepest fantasies lanisha's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking one of the deepest scars of the ghetto her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving and beautifully unsentimentally affirmative br br social realities are respected not propagandized all three girls are being raised by single moms only one lanisha has a father active in her life and not coincidentally of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathetic to others and the one with the most self respect two of them suffer from asthma a disease disproportionately prevalent in the inner city gunfire an accepted daily occurrence only momentarily interrupts their conversation only one of the girls joy feels hope for feels she has control over the future while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair br br this is by far the best dramatic american film i've seen in years see it see it see it
<START> after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci fi paraday 'captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick he was a brave man ' the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket and always remember to beware of the 'doughnut of death ' keep in mind the number one rule of this movie suspension of disbelief sit back and relax and 'prepare to die earth scum ' you just have to see it for yourself
<START> it came by surprise the impact resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people situations most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way a temper tantrum if you will thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all what was this costing me soooo much love sooo many blessings now i'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life for what is happening in the moment without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way the way i think life or people should be this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others without limits expectations and to connect with genuine love without fear of loss just to love first and accept what love is given
<START> i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot a mind bogglingly tedious pointless muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored looking peter falk the 'plot' such as it is just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling or possibly annoying was peter falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'lt' columbo if the producers insist on keeping columbo's first name a secret why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous like i said this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague
<START> dreadful horror sequel to the howling this picks off with karen white's funeral she was killed at the end of the first film stefan crosscoe christopher lee sadly arrives there and tells karen's brother ben reb brown that karen was a werewolf he's going to transylvania to kill striba sybil danning the head werewolf ben and a coworker of karens annie mcenroe join him br br a terrible script bad direction inept editing and truly horrendous acting by brown and mcenroe single handedly sink this one the werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark for good reason they're terrible when you see them subpar special effects also although i did like the cartoon lightning that comes from danning's fingers there's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and danning takes off her top at least eight times during the closing credits br br there are a few good things i found the village in transylvania amusing it looks like it came from a universal horror flick from the 1930s there are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes brown and mcenroe have good bodies and lee and danning are good in this but they can't save it really why did they do this where that they hard up for money this is one of imdb's lowest rated movies that alone should tell you something supposedly danning was horrified when she saw the movie i can understand why a must miss
<START> a perfect little atrocity i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary mtv 4 4 seconds woeful casting worse even than in kusminsky's version a reminder he managed to miscast juliet binoche and ralph feinnnes but hey the rich got what they deserved dark and brooding heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden locked angel frail and angellic catherine presented as a chubby melon breasted heffer meek and weak linton is a peeping tom and innocent isabel becomes sara michelle gellar's character from cruel intentions 15 year old eddie bauer and abercrombie and fitch donners take notice this thing was made for you it is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters but even from initial shock at their actions the actors tried but as i stated before they were miscasted decent photography but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school i implore you all read the book or the cliffnotes even watch the previous versions of it even kusminsky's but stay away from the numerous future reruns during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial free premiere
<START> this really was the worst movie i have ever seen michael vartan is hot but who is this woman and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie the hair is so bad they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is really really boring i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good hhaha they literally just like talk and say yeah and there is no passion whatsoever i could not tell at all that they were in love i'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen
<START> before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another urbane detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and powell's star quality is evident mary astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of brigid o'shaughnessy does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all
<START> what a dog of a movie noni hazelhurst's performance is quite good but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast many of the characters are woefully miscast particularly the ever overrated colin friels br br very little works in this pretentious garbage much of the character development is done through a silly angst ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on screen in fact it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen how are we meant to know colin friels javo is meant to be an erratic violent and unreliable junkie one of these silly voice overs tells us for crying out loud the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin' voice over the real killer is the characters everything about them their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers they are all absurdly well spoken for junkies none seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them br br monkey grip deserves no more attention than a weekday tv movie matinÃ©e crud like this perfectly well shot and technically presented but a clichÃ© driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere at least noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity there's no other sane reason to endure this junk
<START> there is a story possibly apocryphal about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys gilliam allegedly produced a long list think about the aircraft one from the fifth element and handed it to butch bruce it was entitled things bruce willis does when he acts it ended with a simple message saying please don't do any of the above in my movie br br there is a fact about this movie definitely true gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing br br i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary if not commercial success that is the twelve monkeys br br visually the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general but magnificent strangeness gilliam delights in wrong footing his audience although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate it is this journey and the character developments they undergo which unsettles br br i love gilliam films brazil in particular but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness he seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess brazil in particular i still maintain that brazil is gilliam's tour de force but there's no denying that the twelve monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight plotting department style substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex python br br whatever the truth of the rumour above gilliam also manages to get a first rate and very atypical performance out of the bald one bruce is excellent in this film as are all the cast particularly a suitably bonkers and very scary brad pitt br br it's been over a decade since this film was released when i watched it again i realised that it hadn't really aged i had changed of course and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that partly at least is about reflections in mirrors altered perspectives and the absurd one way journey through time that we all make a first rate film 8 10
