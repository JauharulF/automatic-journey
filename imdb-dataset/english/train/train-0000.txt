<START> this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone's really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert redford's is an amazing actor and now the same being director norman's father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all
<START> big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it's just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn't close for bereavement all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
<START> this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s when my friends i were watching this film being the target audience it was aimed at we just sat watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was the rest of the time everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film it must have looked like a great idea on paper but on film it looks like no one in the film has a clue what is going on crap acting crap costumes i can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch save yourself an hour a bit of your life
<START> the scots excel at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my mind's eye an elderly lady my friend's mother retelling the battle of culloden she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eye witness one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives br br of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldn't guess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing time br br stories passed down like this become part of our being who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models warning stories archetypes magic and mystery br br my name is aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists the stuff of legend yet seach'd is rooted in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hear br br aonghas angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him yearns to be in the twenty first century to hang out in glasgow but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelic speaking community br br yet there is a deeper conflict within him he yearns to know the truth the truth behind his grandfather's ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents br br he is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of scotland's most inaccessible mountains can the truth be told or is it all in stories br br in this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with angus as he lives the story of his own life br br seachd the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like angus i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories but also like angus i forgave this once i saw the 'bigger picture ' forget the box office pastiche of braveheart and its like you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even re evaluate the power of storytelling and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced
<START> worst mistake of my life br br i picked this movie up at target for 5 because i figured hey it's sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i'd stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn and that felt better than anything else i've ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life
<START> begins better than it ends funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors it's like those scenes where documentary shots br br spoiler part the message dechifered was contrary to the whole story it just does not mesh br br
<START> lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th century england northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do very good results
<START> the hamiltons tells the story of the four hamilton siblings teenager francis cory knauf twins wendell joseph mckelheer darlene mackenzie firgens the eldest david samuel who is now the surrogate parent in charge the hamilton's move house a lot franics is unsure why is unhappy with the way things are the fact that his brother's sister kidnap imprison murder people in the basement doesn't help relax or calm francis' nerves either francis know's something just isn't right when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again br br co written co produced directed by mitchell altieri phil flores as the butcher brothers who's only other film director's credit so far is the april fool's day 2008 remake enough said this was one of the 'films to die for' at the 2006 after dark horrorfest or whatever it's called in keeping with pretty much all the other's i've seen i thought the hamiltons was complete total utter crap i found the character's really poor very unlikable the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it's 85 a half minute too long 86 minute duration the there's the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud there's this really big sustained build up to what's inside a cupboard thing in the hamiltons basement it's eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy is that really supposed to scare us is that really supposed to shock us is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll is a harmless looking young boy the best 'twist' ending that the makers could come up with the boring plot plods along it's never made clear where the hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except david in a slaughterhouse i doubt that pays much or why they haven't been caught before now the script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective a really bad film that i am struggling to say anything good about br br despite being written directed by the extreme sounding butcher brothers there's no gore here there's a bit of blood splatter a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldn't do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup a camcorder the film is neither scary since it's got a very middle class suburban setting there's zero atmosphere or mood there's a lesbian suggest incestuous kiss but the hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale there's not much here for the horror crowd br br filmed in petaluma in california this has that modern low budget look about it it's not badly made but rather forgettable the acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about i can't say i ever felt anything for anyone br br the hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull boring from which it never recovers add to that an ultra thin story no gore a rubbish ending character's who you don't give a toss about you have a film that did not impress me at all
<START> just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens amores perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in fortunetly this is not that movie the people tell the story this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen
<START> this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school i have to give it credit on its campiness though many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically it was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch br br if you're looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun br br i agree with other comments that the sound is very bad dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there
<START> french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene malÃ©fique preceded the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made malÃ©fique was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named carrÃ¨re sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal after translating part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls br br black magic is a very interesting topic and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it it's fair to say that malÃ©fique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it's very easy to get behind them it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that malÃ©fique actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall malÃ©fique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade highly recommended viewing
<START> when i rented this movie i had very low expectations but when i saw it i realized that the movie was less a lot less than what i expected the actors were bad the doctor's wife was one of the worst the story was so stupid it could work for a disney movie except for the murders but this one is not a comedy it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity the title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after dead husbands i give it 0 and a half out of 5
<START> i love cheesy horror flicks i don't care if the acting is sub par or whether the monsters look corny i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end look i don't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me but dark floors takes the what is this movie about thing to a whole new annoying level what is this movie about br br this isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused rent this winner
<START> anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined we have the submissive heroin addicted part time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son now she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter she's upset with him because he came too quickly and ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then chopping her up we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom you see it's all circular deep huh the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors it's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane we saw this lousy movie then put on zero woman the accused oh my god it was a tossup as to which one was worse what is going on in japan these days sick sick sick
<START> b movie at best sound effects are pretty good lame concept decent execution i suppose it's a rental br br you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen you gonna be ok tommy br br you stay by the airphone when agent harris calls you get me give me a fire extinguisher br br weapons we need weapons where's the silverware all we have is this sporks br br dr price is the snake expert br br local ers can handle the occasional snakebite alert every er in the tri city area
<START> a total waste of time just throw in a few explosions non stop fighting exotic cars a deranged millionaire slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a hugh hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie i really got a laugh out of the dr evil like heavily fortified compound the plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent how many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race answer 4 but didn't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility this was written for pubescent males it plays like a video game i did enjoy the gulfstream ii landing in the desert though
<START> laputa castle in the sky is the bomb the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack which is reused many times after this im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack sheeta the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy pazu is also a great role model he lives on his own the plot is classic miyazaki i won't give it away but the end is really great i rank this as one of miyazaki's three best with nausicaa and spirited away also you may want to check out howl's moving castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa enjoy piper a
<START> at the height of the 'celebrity big brother' racism row in 2007 involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody i condemned on an internet forum those 'c b b ' fans who praised the show after years of bashing 'racist' '70's sitcoms such as 'curry chips' 'love thy neighbour' i thought they were being hypocritical and said so 'it ain't half hot mum' was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blacked up well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke urdu fluently the show's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'rangi ram' the noted indian character actor renu setna said in a 1995 documentary 'perry croft the sitcoms' that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeed br br 'mum' was perry and croft's companion show to 'dad's army' also set in wartime the sedate english town of walmington on sea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of india in particularly a place called deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them bombadier solomons george layton his first sitcom role since 'doctor in charge' camp gunner 'gloria' beaumont melvyn hayes diminutive gunner 'lofty' sugden 'lah de dah' gunner graham john clegg and gunner parkins the late christopher mitchell presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeant major williams the brilliant windsor davies who regarded them all as 'poofs' his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying though he was nice to parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son then there was ever so english colonel reynolds donald hewlett and dimwitted captain ashwood michael knowles rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the tea making char wallah the late dino shafeek who went on to 'mind your language' and the rope pulling punka wallah babar bhatti so real indians featured in the show another point its detractors ignore shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions' similar to the '40's songs used as incidental music on 'dad's army' each edition closed with him warbling 'land of hope glory' only to be silenced by a 'shut up ' from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner br br though never quite equalling 'dad's army' in the public's affections 'mum' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in 1975 davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'whispering grass' they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled what else 'sing lofty ' br br the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than recast the role of 'rangi' the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george layton left the character of 'gloria' took his place as 'bombadier' providing another source of comedy br br the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty the char wallah watching them go with great sadness as did viewers br br repeats have been few and far between mainly on u k gold all because of its so called 'dodgy' reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man blacked up is so wrong why does david lean's 1984 film 'a passage to india' still get shown on television it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars it was derived from jimmy perry's own experiences some characters were based on real people the sergeant major really did refer to his men as 'poofs' i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest 'mum' was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for d v d 's i say time to stop this review as williams would say i'll have no gossiping in this jungle
<START> i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it however i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type however just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that
<START> chances are is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman cybill shepherd whose husband christopher mcdonald is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant we then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him he is told he can return to earth but not as himself flashforward 19 years where we see shepherd's daughter mary stuart masterson preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man robert downey jr who it turns out is the reincarnation of her father the film is a little on the predictable side the story goes all the places you expect it to but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast especially shepherd and downey that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles a lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you
