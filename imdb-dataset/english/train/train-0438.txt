<START> i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo 3 baise moi deep impact but mr seidl almost succeeded hundstage was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards it shows a world where love and humanity don't exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock cartoonist deix director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian european western suburbs the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies violence against women and handicapped people madness and degradation but this isn't social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a sledge hammer and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly misanthropic way and this is why this film is truly despicable
<START> i remember the first time i saw this movie i was in the office working over the weekend the tv was on for background noise but i gradually found myself more more engaged in this movie i'd never seen or heard of until i was completely absorbed a matter of life death the british title stairway to heaven in the us is delightful compelling whimsical moving all in one superbly written well acted perfectly directed package it's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca it's a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane chariots of fire why has it never received the same public notice video store prominence fortunately some knowledgeable critics have put it on their top 100 of all time lists there is hope 1940's fantasia wasn't a hit 'til the '60s the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office but made a hit by tv buy it rent it watch it demand it you won't be disappointed
<START> and laugh out loud funny in many scenes br br the movie's basic plot is well chronicled a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity br br this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau's best film as co stars and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic br br the scene where oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny br br for any fan of intelligent comedies the odd couple is a go out of your way to see it film
<START> jane russell proved to be a delightful musical comedy performer in the similarly titled gentlemen prefer blondes Â but sadly this film squanders those skills there is a budget and nice paris photography but the film just doesn't work ms russell seems to be playing marilyn monroe that leaves nobody to adequately play jane russell some of the other players are way out of their element br br there are several embarrassing scenes most of all be warned there is a musical number where boneheaded african cannibals cook the brunettes in a pot after alan young sings in a gorilla suit br br this is an interesting at times embarrassing waste of resources br br gentlemen marry brunettes 10 29 55 richard sale jane russell jeanne crain alan young scott brady
<START> this is not my favorite wip women in prison but it is one of the most famous films in the sub genre it is was produced by roger corman who at this point had already produced a few wips it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula the movie takes place in an usa prison not in a banana republic like most wip films i'm not sure if that was a wise move but it is an acceptable change of pace writer director demme really gets into his job always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario in fact he is a little too ambitious for his own good the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks in chains flick but do not worry demme still operates within the parameters of the sub genre there is plenty of nudity and violence something that will satisfy hardcore fans the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining the cast is good roberta collins is a wip veteran so she does not need an introduction and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair bound crazy warden pam grier is sorely missed though
<START> there is absolutely no plot in this movie no character development no climax nothing but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good so there you go as a movie overall is pretty bad but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie do not expect nothing more that just that decent acting and a not so bad direction a couple of cameos from kimbo and carano i was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movie she is a good fighter and a really hot girl white is a great martial artist and a decent actor i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art imagine a film with white and jaa together that would be awesome
<START> i never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film that goes for critics as well sure if it gets positive reviews that's ok and a plus but most films that get critical rave i hate i enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining film it takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character that being catherine trammell sharon stone is awesome in this role just like she was in the first one anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b c she is back acting the same way she did in basic instinct 1 catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection her one liners are great much like in the first one who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops if you're gonna arrest me do it otherwise get the f k out of here great scene and believe me she does it again in this one i was captivated by her her outfits the way she smoked her cigarettes believe me its worth the price just to see stone's performance i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd uncut because i can only imagine how much better it is going to be and yes there are lots of twists as in the first one including the ending
<START> this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police br br nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes br br snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn't bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woody's girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i can't honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
<START> in the tradition of g men the house on 92nd street the street with no name now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light while it's 48 year director j edgar hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of light br br the book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out it's important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j edgar hoover headed it some of that time is covered in the film as well br br but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john 'chip' hardesty was created hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties br br in real life the bureau was headed by william j burns of the burns private detective agency it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that br br through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbi's story itself stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with arresting ku klux klan members a plot to murder oil rich indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war br br there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today br br of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one br br the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart's best films but it's the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts i'd feel a lot better about it there's also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson br br vera miles didn't just marry stewart she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates it's dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell
<START> a female country singer nicknamed big t seriously that's what they call her risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard busey who wants to be her manager his mother committed suicide his father's an alcoholic as well and he has a violent temper you can imagine where that leads in the meantime there's music aplenty as parton with her fluid vocal talents belts out song after song at least half a dozen of them about texas steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolias instead
<START> in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy manuel gomez pereira made this film 'things that make life worthwhile it is not an original discovery by many voice you have quite off the pitch by the way but it departs somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined and while some points are not well developed others are out of place a day in the lives of two people close to the median age it's basically what the movie gÃ³mez pereira jorge eduard fernandez is a stationary parado one which despite load on your back with a drama major seems willing to see things change only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence in line with audrey tautou of 'long dating' jean pierre jeunet 2004 jorge says things like this to herself if i find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck of course it finds it begins to play 'today could be a great day' hoy puede ser un gran dia by joan manuel serrat and in a few crosses on its way hortensia ana belen she is another woman entry age divorced and a little lonely take valeriana for sleeping organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior life was going in his head driving data as 70 of people fall in love only once in a lifetime and said although it is short of jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a sadistic sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity later came a communion a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer 'things that make life worthwhile' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and conversely make us take the case as a comedy focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding which seem to be amusing in itself or the gait of a drunk person the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players therefore we can not identify with the dramatic and not give us a solid base comic too leaving everything except pure joke in the end all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn and ends up not doing either and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do ana belÃ©n which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film and eduard fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film so in moments like the accident with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do but that is no excuse to lower our guard in any case both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function 'things that make life worthwhile' work only up to the modest level of entertainment any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that we presume they wanted to do can not afford to have little moments finished successful beyond bad as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh lost drunk compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him neither do much for people like rosario pardo making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase must be screwed over and songs from the soundtrack though significant not just fit it is true that the film by manuel gomez pereira has its hits some of the moments involving jose sacristan but the whole is a anodyne story a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better
<START> it is like what the title of this thread say only impression i got from that movie is that marlee matlin's character was always angry so cynical and so pathetic her character's first date with william hurt's character where they were dancing were dumb all in all i've tried to finish watching the movie four times and of all four times i fell asleep i would keep watching that movie with one intention to beat my problem with insomnia because all it do is to put me to sleep sweet dream
<START> i saw this movie and the play and i have to add that this was the most touching story that i had ever seen until i saw this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african children and adults that were and are living in that era it brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive and to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing this simply surpass a five star i rate it a ten thank you mr mbongeni ngema for such a astonishing story although it has been 12 years since this story has been told it is still one that lays heavy in my heart if there is a vhs or dvd out there on the play please notify me asap thank you ps there was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance
<START> this is a tepid docu drama that covers no new ground reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts for example munich is a very flat city so why is it hilly in the movie for example the end of the great war in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice yet it is announced as a surrender for example european news vendors did not and do not shout headlines as they hawk their papers yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film for example the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as hitler delivers one of his stem winders indeed most of this disappointing production consists of little more than hitlerian oratory the movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the munich hoffbrauhaus it was not robert carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that these comments are based on the first episode only one only can hope the second will be better but don't bet on it
<START> i took a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first season's worth canadian release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it 5 stars on amazon and i am rating it 10 stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j cannell's logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
<START> i saw this film on its release and have watched it 3 or 4 more times including last week i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr branagh's performance br br this is really a glorious sumptuous film to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long beautifully shot and designed derek jacobi julie christie kate winslet richard briers and many others do fine jobs then there's kenneth branagh if ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and mr branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in hamlet from the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others his performance confirms that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never been a great film actor the scenery budget could be charged to catering mr branagh eats so much of it his performance is a perfect example of why people don't go to see shakespeare full of sound and fury signifying nothing and if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance br br no matter what theories people may posit on the bard he was after all is said and done a playwright the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of hamlet itself it amazes me how mr branagh mouthed it but did not hear it it was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something and too little figuring out what he's saying br br while mr branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it his direction has always been better than his acting i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare he set a great template for other productions and it would be interesting to see him onstage from about 20 rows back but i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less br br is it worth seeing certainly there are many little joys to be found in the film but it's a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it
<START> sarah silverman is like a totally manic zooey deschanel and i think i'm in love already yeah if you loved jesus is magic you'll love this if you didn't what the heck is wrong with you kudos to the comedy channel for shoving this in my face my life finally has meaning and your car smells like farts is my kind of humor i'm a happy guy the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i'm hungrily looking forward to next week this is like grease meets south park completely outrageous sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book her delivery is precise and oh so funny she never skips a beat come to think of it it's not so much her choice of material which is some really good stuff by the way as it is the way she chooses to deliver it thank you sarah silverman thank you comedy channel
<START> let's face it the final season 8 was one of the worst seasons in any show i've ever enjoyed mostly i've never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course it's going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair assessment because that '70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times br br all right ignoring season 8 br br topher grace stars as eric forman a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna laura prepon the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde mila kunis jackie wilmer valderrama fez and even ashton kutcher kelso give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably fez a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get what country is he from try to figure it out for another dimension of entertainment debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as eric's parents rupp as kitty is both formidable and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie barone while smith's red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donna's parents the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a stoner who acts as a father figure to hyde br br apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over the top lessons that sometimes come and that deplorable final season '70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spot on direction and a feel good vibe pulsing through every episode they're all alright
<START> this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like buchholz and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at times yes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars
<START> oh dear some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many scenes br br there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i'm afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course oh look there's a hand oh and there's another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling br br for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd but the bbc always said no now i think i understand why
