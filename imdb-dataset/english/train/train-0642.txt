<START> there are very few movies that are so funny as this one i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater reserved for movie buffs like me so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes br br at times the story was a bit slow but that is perhaps for the best a bit of rest in between the rolling amongst the aisles i nearly fell out of the seat was most welcome
<START> unlike tinseltown's version of hello dolly jay presson allen's screen adaptation of ira levin's hit broadway thriller couldn't wait for it's stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen so producers wisely decided to make the most of it's lengthy white way run the film's opening and closing scenes are shot inside new york's intimate music box theater where deathtrap played for nearly five years even the film's final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay's famous logo although marketeers decided to go with a more fun rubik's cube icon for the movie br br now on a low priced dvd release deathtrap seems just as fresh and inventinve as ever the cast is just right better than their stage counterparts and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for our one room two act thriller to take place in opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways director sidney lumet wisely tags any new material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves levin's wickedly twisty center alone br br the film's last scene is a major hollywood departure from the boards and slightly undermines one of levin's plot points from earlier in the film helga about a dagger will be used by another woman because of play like robert altman's the player however our new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage screen and could it be real life
<START> plot an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra marital hijinks in a flashy car they then become stuck literally in a compromising position while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities br br that's it that's the entire movie there may have been some dialogue here and there but nothing comes to mind it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless but actually physically painful to watch the fact that it starred two of the uks best up and coming actors one of whom is now sadly deceased only adds to the horror br br ian charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar winning 'chariots of fire' let's remember him for that role and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened
<START> in a future society the military component does not have to recruit rather their candidates are chosen at birth culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government they are given over to the war machine body and soul for no reason other than to protect and serve they have no personal identity other than a name and rank and no autonomy whatsoever this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in soldier ' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time from preadolescence to adulthood russell is sergeant todd the best of the best and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign he is what he was born to be a soldier but even the best cannot go on forever and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite a new generation of soldiers has been created products of advanced genetics and technology and todd's generation is suddenly obsolete what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life fear and discipline russell gives a commanding performance as todd the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts he has few lines in this movie but russell speaks volumes with his eyes this role demonstrates that he is in fact one of the under appreciated actors of our times that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen sandra and jason isaacs colonel mekum rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee memorable as caine 607 one of the new generation of soldiers sean pertwee mace gary busey captain church michael chiklis jimmy pig and mark bringleson rubrick anderson has delivered an action film with a message a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science fiction soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact it's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference much like 1984 ' and mad max ' this movie which is ultimately uplifting is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share i rate this one 7 10
<START> heavily re edited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer with scott glenn's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12 year old charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe pesci brooke adams danny aiello jonathan pryce have all done better the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott's exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement
<START> this paramount version ripoff of oklahoma annie get your gun calamity jane isn't all that unusual or innovative the marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live tv show i don't find the use of the background cyclorama lit in various scenes with yellow or pink or red or all that innovative as noted it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget all soundstage with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs compare to new faces of 1952 the actors come off reasonably well though and this style was much better realized when paramount shot li'l abner in 1959 of couorse this movie suggests the often repeated question what were they thinking
<START> this is not bela lagosi's best movie but it's got a good old style approach for some 40's horror entertainment br br brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies i think i'd postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught but it's a horror movie so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason anyway lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging sickly wife healthy and happy he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse and the brides just keep on getting zapped br br no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own good at solving crime bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim i love the haunted house bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosi's sinister mansion hidden passageways a vampire like wife an evil dwarf igor assistant and so on good stuff br br fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch
<START> i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time wes craven is at his best ever he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving this is the thriller of the year no doubt br br all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun the f x were great it steadily built suspense i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie it's been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater br br if your looking for thrills action and a good plot this summer redeye delivers go see it
<START> in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations managed many pro wrestlers including 2 backyard wrestling stars worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity lack of talent and skill and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term shot with low dollar video cameras it's essentially home videos of kids play fighting in back yards the sound quality is bad the video quality is bad and the acting is horrendous the wrestlers wear makeshift costumes with hand drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves sometimes the matches are on the grass sometimes on a back yard trampoline all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill in short don't bother with this stinker whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic both in my case you will be terribly disappointed
<START> supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter i'd say 95 is fabricated i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i can't stand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b ch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head it's too incoherent too flashy and way too boring it's a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life
<START> so wonderful so quirky so romantic so italian the film is so feather light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again a kitchen sink world of bakeries and hairdressers and plumbing but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction take your pick they're both faultless let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass
<START> oh wait i can this movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match i couldn't tell where i was in this movie one second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing i think i couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not watch if you're a b movie buff and by b movie i mean bad movie then this film is for you it's home movie and all non sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni though just skip this one
<START> well some people would say that this particular movie stinks but hey thats not right not right at al the movie may not have the best special effects and may not have the best actors except the exelence of the barbarian bros dispite theese minor fact i can honostly say that this is one of the funniest movies iÂ´ve ever seen and iÂ´ve seen em al
<START> except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating eight out of ten stars
<START> contains spoilers br br the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair poofed up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over young's strained demeanor never changes this is one fatally inhibited actress br br one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend arnetia walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all times in that there's no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the skittish self conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesn't have a clue br br with this major void looming at the center of the movie we're left to ponder the implausiblities of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she's trailing and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted she's dressed only in a bra and panties but in a similar situation with a psycho captor due to return any moment would you head for the door or take the time to go through his dresser take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young's character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexity br br there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the criminal's past victims but overall this is an aimless endeavor it's too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle
<START> a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing the movie twists and turns through miriad plot surprises at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing offcourse puncturing the plot with steamy scenes they thought would help it along br br james belushi is involved in this pseudo intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie the same applies for the other actors the plot is quite silly and tacky whih in itelf is not such a crime but towards the end the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring br br however the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day but don't fret if you miss this one br br a rather lame 4
<START> i was one of many that expected to see a glorified yankee doodle dandy portrayal of a day that as famously quoted should live in infamy rather than glory how wrong i was these guys were there right in the middle of it and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september 11 2001 br br two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks at the beginning we see much of this footage just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge br br while investigating a suspect gas line i think my memory's a little hazy on that we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on and possibly realizing the same thing the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building br br what follows is a true view from the front lines we see the commitment of the fdny their reactions the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside while a second camera captures the events from the outside br br if it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering the footage alone would be any young doco maker's dream come true quite simply the footage deserves to be preserved for all time but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer we see firefighters charging in without hesitation people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another they are brothers as they cannot reach one another in the confusion there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film something hollywood could never duplicate even though it's trying br br 9 11 isn't a film about politics nor is it a film about religion nationality or even jihad for that matter 9 11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of 9 11 is quite simply one of the most important films i've ever seen and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me you can't duplicate this
<START> i first saw rob roy twelve years ago with little money for entertainment i rented it for my fiancÃ© and i to watch on a bone chilling winter's night the movie i had wanted was gone so i rented this instead not expecting much and was very much surprised with how good it was i just recently watched it again and loved it every bit as much as the first time br br for those unfamiliar with the story it's about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor a cattleman and folk hero from the little i know about the man and his story liberties have been taken with the facts but it's a movie not a textbook and so the filmmakers can be excused basically the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from but his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis and mary his wife suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham a smarmy englishman with no soul atrocities ensue until in an immensely satisfying conclusion rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey br br there are many great performances in this movie but allow me to touch specifically on a few liam neeson as usual is fantastic a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of honestly this man is like ice cream even when he's bad he's good his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him in the best way he knows how jessica lange as mary gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure you just know she doesn't take any b s from rob or anyone else for that matter tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald yet somehow it works all the posturing and preening combined with some wicked dialogue result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory combine all of this and the stellar work by other supporting players with the luscious scenery of scotland and you have what amounts to one really really cool movie if you haven't seen this i highly recommend that you do
<START> oh my i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i've ever seen i'm serious this is one of the ultimate b movies the first proof is that it isn't a 5 dvd oh no that's too mainstream for this i got this on vhs from a bin full of ex rental videos at my local video store br br if i may quote the blurb in 17th century japan there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages his name was mayeda he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5 000 muscats from the king of spain whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan it then goes on to say a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents br br i must have seen a different movie this was no epic and it certainly wasn't a multi million dollar anything no 'shogun mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of the engrish speaking mayeda sho kosugi he isn't even a shogun really but thats not important what is important is that he does a really cool impression of john cleese's repeated charging of the one castle in 'monty python and the holy grail' and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers awesome br br the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi's engrish accent the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever and honestly do you really want anything else you could fast forward 'shogun mayeda' to the end and replay kosugi's final line over and over the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line awesome br br 2 10 so very very cheesy
<START> man would expect that a movie shot with an approx budget of 300 000 000 u d should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it matrix reloaded proves this assumption wrong br br the matrix worked out better despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story at least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot aka agent inside a simulation aka martix would harm the responsible computer program in any way br br unfortunately the wachowski brothers made excactly this agent bashing the main thing in matrix reloaded it's a beat 'em up o rama this fighting scenes may be work out sufficient or even cool in a 5 sec trailer but prolonged for several minutes apparently being faked choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality unimaginative bashing already seen or better not in eg van damme 'movies' the difference of post production etherything is 5 times faster the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes and this is repeated for at least 5min doesn't help here all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts beside these 'fights' all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for acting br br what's up besides the fighting scenes few except hollywood routine this oh so multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in waterworld are recycled as citizen of zion mans last city on earth and on the order of morpheus they start dancing 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts the oh so popular clichÃ©e of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this je ne sais quoi dumb accent who wastes his fortune because of a liason d'amour is bravely served following this and unwanted funny is the fight between neo and the sinister followers of 'the frog' since it takes place in an erroy flynn like enterieur luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration for neo posing with the hellebarde just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues for being destructed thrown over evil guys and the like and you get 5 more senseless boring min of this junk br br whats left to expect the usual merchandising hell and revolutions which will happen or not certainly without me
