<START> jessica alba's max and valerie rae miller's original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial wonderfully politically incorrect quality varies greatly from episode to episode but generally the standard is high and when it is not jessica is always worth looking at valerie's urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory
<START> i'll get to the movie in a minute first someone wanted proof about clinton's comments at georgetown where he claimed that the usa deserved the 9 11 attacks well here's what clinton said br br in the first crusade when the christian soldiers took jerusalem they first burned a synagogue with 300 jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it br br we're still paying for it whaddya mean we paleface the marines didn't storm the temple mount br br but in truth clinton never really came out and flatly said that we deserved 9 11 like all his statements during his presidency he implied that we deserved 9 11 just point out fact a b c and maybe d and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x when in truth most of clinton's facts added up to guacamole br br but that's beside the point we're here to talk movies not politics unfortunately when oliver captain conspiracy stone does a movie you can't escape his warped politics it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era and what better time than when stone's dreams almost came true on the day reagan nearly bought the farm unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckley's assassination attempt he invents one with al haig from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to release the hounds stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state richard dreyfuss a guy you love to hate on sight br br overall the movie is ok average hovering on below average don't bother renting or buying try to catch it on cable 4 out of 10
<START> this movie delivers the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off br br but this movie doesn't stop there when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer br br stereotypical grilling dads several plot lines that go nowhere and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home
<START> this film really deserves more recognition than its getting it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power this film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china it features an arrangement of great characters actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film all in all 8 10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action there is action by the way so it loses some points for that
<START> i loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them br br the cinematography is a beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish i see a bright future for this writer producer director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity br br kudos for this achievement
<START> first of all i'd like to tell you that i'm into comics anime animation and such stuff it is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie i'll be objective to begin with the story it's ok follows the story line of the comic books as far as i'm familiar with them but the animation well it's not actually terrible but it's definitely cheap and mediocre it would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985 take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special so all in all it lacks atmosphere i watched it but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it it just does not capture you there's plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around but i don't think this is the audience for this movie so they could add a little nudity and spice to it the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have lady death herself there are few sexy looks but that's not enough instead of bill brown's music i think it would look better on a hard rock heavy metal soundtrack all in all the movie isn't that bad but if you want something better take the original heavy metal heavy metal fakk 2000 ralph bakshi's fire and ice or wizards maybe and of course vampire hunter d bloodlust
<START> this thing was bad really bad i mean low budget can sometimes be very inspiring but not this the story was so off the shelf the alien's behaviour so illogical the characters so clichÃ©ed i found nothing good in it and i did try
<START> here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life brent as usual is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young someone mentions gig young and then who appears but gig young the actor worth seeing though far below what it could have been
<START> warning minor spoilers br br i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn't know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can't be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear br br my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn't show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it br br i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it br br otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i'm interested to find out the facts of the real case br br one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie br br p s meadow sisto is lovely i hadn't seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol
<START> somerset maugham's characters are brought to life in rko's of human bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with bette davis' star making performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise it's the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr howard's struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the film br br along the way right away in this version howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis as mildred rogers davis' characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted br br still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a write in campaign for the 1934 best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were br br 1 claudette colbert it happened one night br br 2 norma shearer the barretts of wimpole street br br 3 bette davis of human bondage br br 4 grace moore one night of love br br of human bondage 6 28 34 john cromwell leslie howard bette davis reginald denny
<START> this movie will be a hit with those that enjoy sophomoronic mindless explicit bragging about sexual exploits and f in almost every sentence like a good plot like comedy like romance or other human values stay away from whipped it was so bad i left after about half an hour i saw two kids slip in that looked to be about 10 very harmful this deserves an x
<START> a great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world isn't this why we go to the movies i was especially impressed with the editing and the music the combination of which was very transportive
<START> well there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller usually they are derivative or too ambitious often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable but city hall does not do neither of the above mentioned the plot is cleverly crafted story is believable as far as characters go i would say this movie is a solid average no character seems out of place and al pacino is brilliant as always his portrayal of a charismatic nyc mayor is superb and proves again that al pacino belongs to the absolute top of american actors nowadays
<START> kurosawa is a proved humanitarian this movie is totally about people living in poverty you will see nothing but angry in this movie it makes you feel bad but still worth all those who's too comfortable with materialization should spend 2 5 hours with this movie
<START> to say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks as the other commenter says this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 it is especially incredibly insulting to gays it is awful and not in a so bad it's funny sort of way either it's just plain awful no i have to say it it stinks sorry skunks br br from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for the plot is incoherent the characterization non existent the acting is of the over the top mugging look at me i'm being funny school and so it goes on the set pieces are clumsily set up if at all and are badly executed it's just awful on every front apart from the music maybe i don't remember thinking the music stinks apart from the songs br br to be fair to the makers they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly the opening credits include the title also starring ertha kitt as the voice of betty the meteor since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted ms kitt's contribution from one of her records and the second line of the movie runs something like and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around uranus uranus your anus geddit geddit huh huh your anus the humour really is that cheap br br it says strange things about the comedies of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say sh t out loud br br i paid fifty pence about 1 00 for this movie in a sale i feel ripped off
<START> i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot had potential who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an elvis constellation which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators sending them crashing through the roof bad really bad which is the theme for the whole movie i'd avoid this one at all costs
<START> jeff wincott is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time ok so maybe bridgette nielson isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job nontheless and let's not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert stuntwoman karen sheperd so she's not cynthia rothrock who cares she's just as good if not better just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word ouch my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on some great martial arts action
<START> i watched this tape immediately rewound it watched it again and laughed twice as hard i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of but uncomfortable around transvestites it shows you that transvestitism is a feature rather than the entirety of one's being the comedy is not single issue this man is brilliant all comics should aspire to his level of candor intelligence and talent
<START> i am a big fan of stephen king's work and this film has made me an even greater fan of king pet sematary is about the creed family they have just moved into a new house and they seem happy but there is a pet cemetery behind their house the creed's new neighbor jud played by fred gwyne explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery that burial ground is pure evil jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life the only problem is that when they come back they are not the same person they're evil soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary everything starts to go to hell i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work the story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping this film features lots of make up effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the make up effects there is one character in this film that is truly freaky that character is zelda this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise zelda is rachel creed's sister who passed away years before but rachel is still haunted by her the first time zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living out of me there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect pet sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing make up this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time 10 out of 10
<START> this movie is cold bare truth often we think oh no that won't happen to me but it can drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly or tricked into doing things for smugglers the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them only wanted a exotic holiday which turned into a nightmare people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated this is a major problem in today's society br br i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie it is very emotional and raw well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory
