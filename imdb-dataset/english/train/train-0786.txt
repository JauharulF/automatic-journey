<START> i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies yes i know all of them are very corny mediocre in some certain areas and sure even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement hey lighten up it's a kids movie but all that aside aren't they still good pieces of entertainment in my opinion they are so and i enjoy them greatly this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three and certainly cuter it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable fresh pokemon celebi it's not the best pokemon movie but i do enjoy it more than the third installment even though the third is not bad and the entire series is just entertaining harmless popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more nothing less this film has some high marks of intensity and interest especially around the climax ending as do all the installments and the characters while a bit more lackluster than the previous three i thought are still likable and humorous this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions and it doesn't deserve that
<START> okay so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out that is actually not the case it's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not br br to be honest i really enjoyed the concept of this movie they had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love hate relationship between mother and daughter i did not however enjoyed watching lindsay lohan's acting in reality this movie would have been great if they had someone else perhaps a better actress the character of rachel lohan is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film br br i do however think that if you put lindsay aside you will enjoy this film the ending is pretty great and sad
<START> breaking glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once it is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible looking at some of today's 'search for a star' style tv shows on both in the uk and abroad i am always reminded of this film though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there this film predates these shows though the effect seems the same after getting rid of her manager played quite brilliantly by phil daniels slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out you potential stars of tomorrow watch this and beware
<START> for the love of god please don't see this movie its a waste of time the plot is predictable as are the romantic scenes trying to build too much with very little this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame the characters aren't developed and most of the film is padded out with shots of rome which is much more interesting than the actual film to top all of that the acting is a disgrace i know everyone tries to find their niche but this is truly a disaster i can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen don't waste money or time on this film go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead
<START> to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart though it is a very different kind of film the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set but some things never seemed to change scottland is still run by english nobles and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them rob roy is handsomely done but not the grand epic that braveheart was there are no large scale battles and the conflict here is more between individuals and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time rob roy is simply a film about those with honor and those who are truly evil br br liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose john hurt things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well being of his community sounds fair enough doesn't it problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves one of them known as archibald cunningham is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film played wonderfully by tim roth this man is a penniless would be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother this man is disgustingly effeminate rude heartless and very dangerous with a sword he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility he rapes macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come along with another crony of the marquis brian cox cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity br br spoilers ahead br br luckily for the macgregor's a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace and for most of the fight it looks like these attributes will win out just when it looks like rob roy is finished he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner the first time you see what happens you will probably be as shocked as cunningham rob roy is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and perfectly paced the score is quite memorable too the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange who might seem to be out of her element actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor the film is violent but there isn't too much gore it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior however the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy the film has no obvious flaws thus it gets 10 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> amy poehler and rachel dratch are among the funnier women to have been on saturday night live it's unfortunate that they along with tina fey and maya rudolph were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch making circa 2002 2006 the show has ever had still these two women most especially know what's funny and they know how to write a funny movie br br you'll notice in the credits of this movie that dratch and director ryan shiraki wrote the story for spring breakdown but who wrote the actual screenplay consisting of dialogue and all the important fill in the blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie yep just shiraki just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie and no women apparently wrote the script with him the result is a pretty clichÃ© spring break movie that doesn't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every year br br if dratch poehler and even co star parker posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay it would have been far less clichÃ© the premise is original being about three thirty something women who were unpopular in high school and apparently college too who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about i say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro woman anthems like true colors and spend their nights together holding make your own pizza parties even though none of them are especially unattractive the outside world appears to treat them like they are there's a scene where a blind student of poehler's played by poehler's real life husband will arnett asks her out on a date only to touch her face and immediately change his mind if poehler's character is supposed to be unattractive they obviously hired the wrong actress br br the movie continues to show promise even though we have our doubts about the main characters when posey's boss texas senator 'kay bee' hartmann jane lynch funny as always hires posey to watch over her unpopular college age daughter amber tamblyn playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie while she goes to a laguna beach like vacation spot for spring break poehler and dratch come along they reluctantly get boozed up party like they apparently should have when they were in college and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by sophie monk br br sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons unfortunately her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny date movie 2006 and the disappointing click 2006 here she plays a southern belle although her voice sounds like she stole delta burke's voice box she hams it up a little too much trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras br br spring breakdown was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy poehler but rightly so because the story is way too clichÃ© it may as well have been called national lampoon's spring breakdown and the magazine probably wouldn't have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity if director shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input especially rachel dratch this movie would have been great and not nearly as run of the mill as frat house comedies we've seen before i know dratch will come up with another funny concept and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself she's funny enough and she deserves better than this half baked comedy that would accept stiffler's brother with open arms
<START> often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it's seen since the days of granny and jed clampett plot centers on two chauffers who've bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy bisset and woronov first if manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend br br lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to africa br br hilarious fun
<START> this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like vancouver's rise to prominance the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon br br i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the 'boy band' craze after all both n'sync and the backstreet boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written br br also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the 'concert' scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don't seem to move the story along in any way br br i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn't his strong suit but its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he's infamous not famous br br
<START> a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer as a starring vehicle although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie not many does this mean the female butt cannot be funny goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona ventures in projects other won't sandra bullock occasionally goes there for example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall a wonderful performer great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon cliff deyoung notably
<START> this is the movie that epitomizes the d d fear of the 80s and even today the fear being that people who play d d or any other role playing game for that matter will be sucked in and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy and go on killing sprees child sacrifices suicide etc great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects but anyone who has played a role playing game a video game or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence it is to d d what wargames was to computers plus as a movie it just kinda sucks
<START> another too bad the lowest they can go here is one otherwise this would get an easy zero truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact were peckenpah's name not on the thing i would never have guessed he did it actually one of the people in san francisco i know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that sam was just plain snockered it shows in spades the laughing bit at the early part of the film is the only thing in this entire mess worth a second look not even gig young is watchable this is a true test of masochism had i been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it i would have jumped up screaming and now i truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave what a mess it seemed less written than made up as they went along it's not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards yikes
<START> a very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his success the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great swimmer and had a great shout
<START> giallo fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films i don't want to give anything away so i wont even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema for 15
<START> skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply isn't a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled disorganised movie br br an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man Â the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued br br this was a very early film in reynolds' career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed Â he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comicalÂ and that's just not the right idea we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn't do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless
<START> like most comments i saw this film under the name of the witching which is the reissue title apparently necromancy which is the original is better but i doubt it br br most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad in many ways i think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value but don't be fooled there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety no diabolique rumpy pumpy involved br br this movie is so inherently awful it's difficult to know what to criticise first the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker at least troma is tongue in cheek though this is straight faced boredom personified the acting is variable with pamela franklin flora the possessed kid in the innocents would you believe the worst with her high pitched screechy voice welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque the other female lead has a creepy face so i don't know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film and the doctor is pretty bad too he also looks worringly like gene wilder br br it is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy this is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that only the lighting is ok the sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up the 'ghost' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs br br really this film the witching at least is only for the unwary it can't have many sane fans as it's pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind numbingly dull br br the best bit was when the credits rolled enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague
<START> the strange people living in a town go about their lives there's the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun though i didn't see the cleansing coming worth a shot if you've nothing else to watch and you're waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix
<START> i can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film it was truly a lot of fun the special effects were wonderful i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters but not this time i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn't enjoy the film i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time blair witch and the mummy both films that i thought were terrible blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck people liked it for it's special effects films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting's e ticket
<START> this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travolta's career he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood even though it was made in 1980 it is still timely today the great country music soundtrack is terrific 10 10
<START> corbin bernsen's sent letters to four criminal associates he's worked with in the past and it's a real intergenerational mix with fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ and ruben blades they're to meet him in this obscure montana town and he doesn't explain why because he's then picked up by out of state police from new jersey on a warrant br br of the criminal group that's been gathered together they all know bernsen but don't know each other a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out as the oldest gwynne though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling but going along especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind br br as for bernsen he's got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in ed o'neill and daniel roebuck he gets the drop on o'neill and escapes br br after that it's the four criminals trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the police in the intricately plotted screenplay it's fascinating how both story lines keep intertwining with each other hoyt axton as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town br br disorganized crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon i can't say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together br br ironically none of these people are comedians per se but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out br br disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie the kind of film that well known pessimist mr murphy would have written
<START> no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in trouble br br it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isn't anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a point br br boring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette aren't enough to save this film
