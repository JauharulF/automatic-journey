<START> just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money hey i dig adam batman west and tina giligan's island louise but hello this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town beat up everybody and everything and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero adam west looks the part as a hero but he's missing cape and his batman uniform sorry just isn't the same tina l looks really nervous and frightened the whole show but at least we know what happened to ginger once she was rescued from the island lol the bikers are a motley group and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have hell riders is hell to watch
<START> this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 his character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the film's jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandler's career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time
<START> this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies you remember this famous conditioned reflex experiment from your school books right the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal's reflexes pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted aussie slasher flick i hear you think well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in nightmares is an exact variant on pavlov's experiment each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims so this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass that way they still don't miss anything special br br regarding the quality of nightmares as a film i can be very brief this is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies in the early 60's a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident twenty years later the same girl Â helen selleck Â is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part shortly after the big premiere everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already i don't think i've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than nightmares and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment the murders are explicit and very bloody and there's also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy however the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible
<START> the three stooges in a feature length western comedy musical perhaps rockin' in the rockies was meant to combine the stooges comedy short with the western musical in a matinÃ©e if so this was a pleasant way to break up a saturday afternoon jay kirby as rusty is a handsome young hero and mary beth hughes as the blonde june and gladys blake as the brunette betty are pretty women the hoosier hotshots are a harmonious group their songs are quite tuneful however this is the 1940s not the 1950s so the film doesn't exactly rock there are a few laughs but the stooges' brand of humor is more subdued than usual the talking horse is also underutilized br br rockin' in the rockies 4 17 45 vernon keays moe howard larry fine curly howard mary beth hughes
<START> there's enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately we're battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as i've described them br br ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match br br jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we don't get to know them hence we don't get to care for them the result is boredom br br if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allende's book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest br br not recommended
<START> the ladies man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes including the funniest love song ever written br br ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role br br tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there br br it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round br br i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4 7 10 and i urge you to vote br br and remember kids theres more motion in the ocean
<START> this movie was so terrible it was almost good almost we love musicals but not this one even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance especially toward the end the character marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too br br the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music admittadly some of the songs fantabulous are pretty catchy but not in a good way br br open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful we think it might be a good stage musical with excellent actors
<START> when i was younger i liked this show but now blecch this show is sappy badly written and rarely funny the three leads were all good actors and funny men saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with as was coulier a better stand up and stamos was a better than average actor after a while stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff who could blame him the show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money br br here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show br br 1 the catch phrases how many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude' 'you got it dude' 'nerdbomber' 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period br br 2 kimmy gibler the most annoying character ever written for television br br 3 the writing stale and cliched as an oreo cookie there is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing full house had bad cliched writing br br 4 three men living together in san francisco enough said br br 5 unrealistic stuff too much to recall br br 6 trendy kids the girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into br br now this show is on nick nite i would hardly call it a classic i have nothing bad to say about the people involved since i think many of them are talented in their own right but this show was just so sugary sweet i couldn't stand it after a while
<START> this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too it's just basically a wonderfull movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick
<START> or was honest iago actually smirking at the end as he died br br loved how the bard's iambic pentameter just rolled of fishburne's tongue with excellent clarity and emotion br br and how branagh made honest iago seem to celebrate his own evilness br br this is a wonderful film br br i have often thought that shakespeare is inherently not film friendly he uses words to create pictures in our minds which creates a perennial battle with the camera which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel every effort to film shakespeare ought really to be celebrated it is not an easy thing to do
<START> seriously i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was thankfully i'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film's most positive asset it was very short for a full length film
<START> stardust another guarded review originally written june 15 2007 br br the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet wth so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadn't either sort of when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal movie goer turns out it wasn't transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as 'that neil gaiman movie' what is it about well in short it's a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and i'd be giving away plot info which is a a breach of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what it's about go buy the book rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writer br br not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors they rarely have a mixed screening and local sci fi fantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expect br br oh how sweetly wrong i was br br yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ahem eragon it was much more intimate than all that br br but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities it's surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism it's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy before i go on let's do this movie review thing br br acting is in the very least good it's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter o'toole is well peter frickin' o'toole which is marvelous ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain't never heard of br br claire danes claire danes claire danes i've always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this she's the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes she's not as good as she can be when cox isn't in the scene however well see for yourself br br special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet sorry potter direction is light hearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top bracket br br and now that that's done br br the writing oh the writing neil you devil it's hard in today's climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three what's new but gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how it's all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you're me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end you'll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not fantastical and real br br i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won't ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured it's done properly br br those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new withheld for this generation the blank gets filled in only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it you'll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles even if it does it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know br br br br forgot to add the withheld reveal i'm a few years late but a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation br br perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i'm still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride
<START> what i found so curious about this film i saw the full 4 hour roadshow version is how oddly dispassionate it is for a film about 2 very charismatic men castro and che engaged in a gargantuan political struggle it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che go here go there do this and that with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro joaquim de almeida but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers the film becomes a dullish epic length film about hairy bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end several of the reviews i've read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely one in fact spent more time talking about soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in spanish with english subtitles this is an odd odd thing to do since a soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b it's no more than a competent job of work with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stone's jfk in the black and white cut up camera work when che visits new york if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie
<START> we should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there only five others joined before the movie began br br there is nothing at all to redeem this movie the acting is awful especially ms hurley the script is banal the effects we've seen a million times the film direction the worst that we've seen meandering and disjointed no one laughed including the kids br br we left after 25 minutes it would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone for a hot dog br br do not waste your money on this film if there's nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks popcorn and hot dogs and do some people watching you'll have a much more enjoyable time br br
<START> to communicate in film essential things of life like what is life does it have a meaning is sheer impossible of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film story but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness this happens if the input from the senses overrules the input from our mind i e our thoughts few directors know how to communicate essential things tarkovsky is one his stalker shows images of existence communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind i think de zee and de graaff do the same
<START> went to wal mart and found this film on dvd and had no idea whether i made a bad purchase or a good one it is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end michelle rodriquez diana guzman bloodrayne '05 gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful sexy and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother she decides to get boxing training in a local brooklyn gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers in her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys there is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys if you like boxing and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you know what this is the film for you
<START> i recently watched this but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was in short i had no idea what it was was it a documentary was it a comedy routine well it was both br br it started a little slow but i think that's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing but it quickly sucked me in the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history mainly how we american's learn history that isn't really true and how we got to learn what we did he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be br br i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode
<START> the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show cased here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely wife played perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not name and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multi talents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
<START> the hazing is confused mumbo jumbo that wants so hard to be the evil dead that it even references bruce campbell several times the problem is it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie this movie is nowhere near as original the plot has been used before by kevin tenney in night of the demons and that was a lot more fun this flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings br br brad dourif is as usual not given much to do here but when he is on screen he puts in another over the top performance that would make christopher walken jealous as for the acting of the kids it's passable but by no means good the shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric there are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims but it was never scary for a second the gore level is mid range to low but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times all in all just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste
<START> even if you're not a big ramones fan rock 'n' roll high school is still the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made why because under all the campiness it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel and justifiably so for the boring stupid fascist establishment world of adults that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock 'n' roll br br
