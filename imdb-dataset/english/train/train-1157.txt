<START> i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence br br three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times br br there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boy's brief short rather than a fleshed out full length film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts br br the 1st part boxer stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their cat mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lot locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want br br the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacks off tony doesn't seem to mind but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the all important transition from i'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because i'd like to spread his ass and do him s m style a very important thing to leave out br br clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the make up bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent show br br there wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
<START> charles mcdougall's resume includes directing episodes on 'sex and the city' 'desperate housewives' queer as folk' 'big love' 'the office' etc so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzer's novel surrender dorothy a success and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat br br sara alexa davalos a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends gay playwright adam tom everett scott adam's current squeeze shawn chris pine and married couple maddy lauren german and peter josh hopkins with their infant son to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara results in an auto accident which kills sara meanwhile sara's mother natalie swedlow diane keaton who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting 'surrender dorothy' is playing it up elsewhere when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among sara's friends slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life natalie's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come together br br diane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together the screenplay has its moments for good lines but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given yes this story has been told many times the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching grady harp
<START> oh those sneaky italians it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it james m cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic br br the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment br br leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier br br nevertheless i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie it's simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies br br 8 10
<START> the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsense br br the film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 br br anywayz some classic gems from the film paresh rawal i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf as a child i laughed at it that time but here br br the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a dual role one older and younger and rekha playing the older's wife and raveena the youngers we also have reject harish while shakti playing the son of aruna irani who both fight on who has the worst wig br br direction is outdated music is bad br br anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo
<START> i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie
<START> jean luc godard's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker bits of political theater mind numbingly boring and interminable are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil featuring the rolling stones in the studio br br the process of the song's development from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end is fascinating and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones almost half the movie is devoted to this so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together br br when i had this on laserdisc i valiantly attempted to watch it all but i don't see how anyone could get through it i finally gave up and just chapter skipped my way to the stones segments

<START> david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games ' a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay crouse has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel 'driven ' still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability when a patient billy hahn steven goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay she decides to intervene on his behalf this takes her to the house of games ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe mantegna a charismatic con man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world instead of the twenty five large' that billy claimed he owed mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if she'll agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the tell' of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a tell' is and how it works to the lessons of the short con ' to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid up tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self assured exterior and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum joey lilia skala dr littauer j t walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant moran house of games' is the quintessential mamet he's written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up you'll find it under perfection ' this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10
<START> the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment even in the lengthy scenes of esther's acting lessons we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions after suffering through esther's largely self inflicted pain in excruciating detail we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph br br the obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence yet the causes of this pain poverty quasi autism judaism sexual betrayal never come together in a coherent whole a 163 minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience
<START> i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of and it would be best to avoid it but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film the so called jokes in this film bring a cringe to the face they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped i never want to have to see this film again i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
<START> i was p ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight i put it on remind as soon as i could so was it worth the wait well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is enter duke george wendt who introduces him to his boss ray danny baldwin one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around and it goes on from there which leads me back to the question posed was it worth the wait yes and no the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me he just took the ball and ran with it but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped but fumbled and taken in the other direction i know where this point happened exactly but can't say without spoiling the film but needless to say it happened the ending doesn't save the film either poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like re animator or castle freak br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime extreme br br eye candy kari wuhrer shows her ta tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta tas and it pans down and oh my god my eyes my eyes
<START> this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it they might wake up and do something about it over the last few months abc family began airing a new format of movies i have seen the last three and enjoyed them they were engaging and did the trick my wife likes these films i was looking forward to viewing see jane date the trailers looked and sounded great unfortunately this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project the year is 2003 the source all bad the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all it worked against it i work in the business of film and television i enjoy being entertained this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie to add to the overall experience the end left me shaking my head an advice to the executives at disney abc abc family and the producers under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word contemporary present day and current means when describing a romantic comedy there is a world passing you by all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck sertner and abc family
<START> although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie in part because i usually give every movie an even break and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad i stand corrected not even george kennedy barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh namely during the simon says scene the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny and some of them you actually see coming a mile away this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane i ii naked gun i ii iii or scary movie they all had a funny gags b good dialog and most important of all c unforgettable quotes men in white has got d none of the above to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement avoid this movie anyway you can consider yourselves warned
<START> this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution br br i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace it's not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here it's sedate because that's what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds br br i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what you've read from the other postings an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data br br take it from there br br this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia br br then it begins to accelerate br br the acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning br br and at the end all is not what it seems br br get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen
<START> rich ditzy joan winfield a woefully miscast bette davis is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice jack carson looking lost her father eugene palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins james cagney seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love br br this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why the script is just horrible there's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus this is done three times only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated as it is they both do their best with the lousy material cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn't work carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles but all in all this was dull and laughless a real chore to sit through this gets two stars only for cagney and davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it's not worth seeing cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why
<START> 1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and while reaping great profits at the box office was setting the art of film making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology br br show people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the new found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesn't really love unless fate somehow intervenes br br one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent era films and in its early sound era films is feature shots of how film making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
<START> this movie is a true masterpiece it really is it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter heartbreak and with a little drama to keep you on your toes br br a true family film homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment chance who wouldn't love a dog like chance he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper 'here kitty kitty kitty not on your life chubby ' br br there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the waterfall i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the ditch almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow br br a favourite for all time anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime
<START> really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers br br if you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking br br there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes br br terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wrists br br i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie no reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
<START> okay i've always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series it's like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker who in my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much more do not waste your time on this show or your money
<START> this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan piquor simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often br br the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is br br story no new ground charted here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film br br violence you won't be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes br br acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making endeavor is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs br br nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched in a poorly done scene by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom both male and female nudity here
