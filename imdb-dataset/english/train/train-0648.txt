<START> let's see in the st elsewhere finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child newhart ended by telling us that it had all been a dream and roseanne ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind very creative annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasn't at all reality it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all real at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat frustrating and simply not fun to watch now newhart being all a dream at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan
<START> it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millennium br br the fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logic br br after she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally i don't mean after an attack had already started because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level no woman would do that unless she 1 had a weapon 2 has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or 3 the attackers are so young and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged and by the way when the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help or scream br br when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she should've ran br br i didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because i loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on it br br why would she carry a loud red toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox first she resists then eventually opens it and takes out a wrench this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch push open manipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical shoot him in the face render him unconscious which was the hero's plan all along it feels like that's what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugs br br throughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackers br br when she was running away how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from them br br finally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didn't get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder
<START> as someone who lived through and still remembers that decade vividly if the actual '70s had been half this funny and semi normal they would have been so much more enjoyable actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright eyed and normal as these kids did the country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned especially in the behavior department the petulance the smugness the self righteousness the childishness the unreasonableness of them none of the characters exhibit any of that br br someone compared to happy days and i can see why they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast and they both offer only surface cliched depictions of the actual eras not even close to the full scope of it just showing the obvious things the fashions toys music contraptions etc and that's it for those too young to remember or weren't born then trust me the '70s weren't like that any more than happy days were like the actual '50s as m a s h didn't accurately portray life at a us army medical base during the korean war etc
<START> while this movie has many flaws it is in fact a fun '80s movie eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils br br couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis this makes for a fun rainy day action comedy flick br br
<START> richard tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything he doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents might happen to him so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining in there the whole story takes place he experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more but the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like macaulay culkin could not make the story better than it is
<START> how can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5 4 just the lovely young alisan porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating james belushi is good in this too his first good serious role i hadn't liked him in anything but about last night until this he was pretty good in gang related with tupac also kelly lynch you gotta love her well i do i'm only wondering what happened to miss porter br br i gave curly sue a 7
<START> every scene was put together perfectly this movie had a wonderful cast and crew i mean how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr in it none have and ever will exist he has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent this movie was perfect i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in blockbuster and like it was calling out to me i couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me you can call me a sappy romantic but this movie just touched my heart not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time even though it made me cry i admit at the end the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter i suggested to my horror action and pure humor movie buff of a brother who absolutely adored this movie this is a movie with a good sense of feeling it could make you laugh out loud touch your heart make you fall in love and enjoy your life every time you purposefully walk past this movie just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie who knows what if it could really happen to you and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life
<START> lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama lies quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam with an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance lies is simply not recommendable c
<START> hello this movie is well okay just kidding its awesome it's not a block buster smash hit it's not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are rockin' rollers go ramones this is a great movie for me
<START> please humour me if you will for a minute while i read you the back of the alley cat vhs box it says that br br in this part of the city every street is a dead end on every corner something to buy in every alley another way to die to survive you're got to be the best just like the alley cat alley cat this lady owns the night on the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive cross her and you've run out of luck alley cat this animal is aroused br br now isn't that one of the most pathetic blurbs you've ever heard in your life whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video yet unfortunately whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of english was doing their job only too well the movie contained within the little plastic case is as bad as it sounds and then some br br karin mani plays the title role and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a pout like a goldfish b kick male butt or c show off her feminine 'attributes' no complaints about the latter but in terms of the other two let's just say she isn't much of an actress and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert but even meryl streep with cynthia rothrock's body what a scary thought would fail to save this movie the unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag inducing love scene with the interestingly named robert torti the camera work also follows a similar path of shame with far too many unneeded close ups and continuity errors abound br br the part that i think really sums this scum bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich kid rapist leers at her from the box not only does he get off scot free despite the overwhelming evidence against him but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his honour behind bars she then has a group shower a lesbian crush a couple of cat fights and a nice sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle this ten minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it i can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more t a to the mix and came up with this needless sub plot as a means to achieving that end br br which kinds of begs the question is this an exploitation film or a serious drama neither is my response to that it isn't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of troma style cinema and it certainly doesn't make the grade as an exploration of one woman's fight against the system purely because it is so appallingly made so who on earth would want to see it lunatics i guess or imdb reviewers who stay up till 3pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep sadly on this occasional i failed and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time don't make the same mistake i did have a hot milk or something 1 10
<START> i wouldn't recommend this unless you're keen on david copperfield and want to complete the set there are some good performances e g uriah heep and well directed moments e g the beating but on the whole it really pales in comparison with the 1999 bbc version as well as earlier versions br br there are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except possibly to dumb it down the stolen jewels being a case in point the american cast were poorly chosen sally field is a good actress but she is wrong as betsy trotwood and her english accent is only slightly better than dick van dyke's cockney i can see why michael richards was chosen to play mr micawber he hams it up rather too much however and becomes irritating he also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous anthony andrews is menacing as mr murdstone but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie david's mother to a railway line though this is perhaps partly the fault of dickens br br i got this for free with a newspaper it helped pass a sunday afternoon but i felt more disappointed than charmed at the end of it
<START> featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid solo seven pounds races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high profile br br too bad i figured out will smith's scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart disease br br however i still think the writer director made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith's and dawson's character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two br br one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith's character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it's quite a versatile performance br br lastly i can't forget to mention the crash scene re enactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list
<START> so far after week two of the lone of beauty i am a little disappointed br br some of the acting is good as long as we except that it is only drama br br i am unsure how people can feel that this fictional drama is factual coverage of the thatcher years it is okay as drama but i feel the award winning book is still much better br br i wonder if the bbc will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with things can only get better finishing with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting with that promise from a government that is full of sleaze
<START> i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence back then it was unrated and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television especially back then i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 luckily i had stupid babysitters and party going parents on the weekends most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys breaking into houses to sniff underwear feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off a very racy film for the early '70s until i checked imdb i had no idea this movie had such a following most people i talk to have never heard of it
<START> comparable to fight club the matrix a i sixth sense among others this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before the first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz cruise cruz the rest of the movie is well confusing you'll pick more every time you watch it i've gone to the movies to see it 3 times now
<START> you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a pity then that the parrot cat dog were only in support not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout br br if i were you paul eva lake what sort of name is that jason lindsay i would forget this acting lark do something else as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry awful actors to boot br br the main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting me not gay which is funny as if you weren't you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy tedious dare i say very plain women leads in the film br br the worst film i have seen in years hopefully never see one as bad again though i expect not
<START> this film had such promise what a great idea an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge poor editing and a half written story the characters in the beginning were interesting only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one liners br br maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie instead of a almost afterthought effort
<START> professor paul steiner is doing research in matter transference he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear only to have that object re materialize in a different location but there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed after a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding professor steiner decides to test his machine on himself as expected things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill br br in hindsight maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re watch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly return of the fly and curse of the fly there seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period i'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence however the projected man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogy br br besides being terribly unoriginal the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie a big issue i have is with bryant haliday in the lead he's such a horse's ass that not only do i not care about his suffering i actually root for it supporting cast members mary peach and ronald allen are almost as bad they're so bland and dull they hardly matter in fact there's very little to get excited about while watching the projected man the soundtrack Â not very memorable the look Â i would describe much of it as muddy the plot Â predictable the action Â there isn't any overall this is one to avoid br br fortunately i watched the projected man via a copy of the mystery science theater 3000 episode funny stuff while not an absolute very often the poorer the movie Â the better the mst3k riffs the guys hit almost all of their marks with the projected man i'll give it a very enthusiastic 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> this version is pretty insipid i'm afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william hurt's weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can't believe that they eliminated edward's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70's version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched rochester's character the way that scott did
<START> i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't see coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets csi br br did anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman are they related in any way i'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video br br dedee was great haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly br br if you're into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
