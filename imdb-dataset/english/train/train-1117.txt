<START> i saw this movie for 2 reasons i like gerard butler and christopher plummer unfortunately these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot because it does explain his disdain for all things christian but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public me and the 5 other people who saw this film that he still exists i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself
<START> i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers br br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so clichÃ© it wasn't even funny any more the same old stories you've probably seen read a couple of times already living toys evil things from other dimensions and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichÃ©s i'd prefer e g chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and don't even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film student's project gone wrong blood or gore erm nothing worth mentioning br br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen read that many scary stories yet although i'd rather recommend beyond belief now that's what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting
<START> what a class bit of british cinema it's about time and a side splitting comedy to boot br br anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticket br br it's a mix between withnail and i and easy rider the movie runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift off for too long at times there are reflective moments but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me oh well br br i would thoroughly recommend it this will become a cult british comedy well worth a visit
<START> i remember stumbling upon this special while channel surfing in 1965 i had never heard of barbra before when the show was over i thought this is probably the best thing on tv i will ever see in my life 42 years later that has held true there is still nothing so amazing so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here you can talk about all the super stars you want to this is the most superlative of them all br br you name it she can do it comedy pathos sultry seduction ballads barbra is truly a story teller her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary but this special was made in the beginning and helped to create the legend that she quickly became in spite of rising so far in such a short time she has fulfilled the promise revealing more of her talents as she went along but they are all here from the very beginning you will not be disappointed in viewing this
<START> a resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge a lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas most of the budget was probably spent on lon chaney jr to star as kharis the mummy br br other players are george zucco wallace ford turhan bey dick foran and elyse knox br br how much longer can this madness continue
<START> the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands is told in the 1939 film gunga din based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant douglas fairbanks jr and victor mclagen the title role is played by sam jaffe well known in my era as ben casey's boss dr zorba a name that became synonymous with big out of control hair say dr zorba hair to anyone of my generation and they know what you're talking about br br set in india at the time of the british occupation three soldiers two romantic dashing figures in grant and fairbanks and mclagen as a big lug are cut ups in reality three overgrown boys gunga din is the water carrier treated somewhat meanly verbally anyway by mcchesney mclaglen but cutter grant is fond of him when he catches din pronounced deen practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers cutter gives him a few pointers br br the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine fairbanks announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman joan fontaine and leaving the service however when gunga din and cutter run across thugees a murderous cult led by a guru eduardo cianelli gunga din escapes to warn the unit and ballantine insists on re enlisting to help save cutter it's a buddy movie after all br br gunga din starts out lightheartedly with slapstick and wonderful broad comedy particularly by cary grant who is quite funny both he and fairbanks are so handsome it's hard to decide which one to look at first much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting in the last part the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense thrilling battle br br grant has the showiest role fairbanks is the lovesick romantic and mclaglen as mcchesney mostly due to his treatment of gunga din is the most unlikeable character although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie his softness comes through toward the end of the movie particularly in the very touching tear jerking final scene br br always a gentle and likable actor sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din a simple brave man with a big smile powerful imagination and lofty dreams without much dialogue jaffe conveys gunga din's soul magnificently br br this is truly the ultimate adventure film massive in scope with good acting rousing scenes a wonderful musical score and some beautiful cinematic images another one from that remarkable year 1939 highly recommended
<START> boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created when this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying it was funny diversified and to some extent factual the characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals the sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous julie bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of media programming of sex and violence julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this production rene adjurdubois is an excellent actor who has from the days of benson to this production held his own in the field of entertainment always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production captain kirk is funny and humorous is candace bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress james spader there is no doubt in his acting ability however he should go back to his xxx origins such as crash as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction we ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell
<START> probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this br br 1 they might not have read the book 2 they might enjoy gore and violence in a film 3 they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence 4 people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book 5 there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here br br the only thing i liked about this film is the song 'bright eyes br br if perchance you happen to be one of those people who has read the book enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence you are sure not to like this otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this br br like in the book a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come only a few rabbits including his brother hazel believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live
<START> sadly it was misguided this movie stunk from start to finish it was hard to watch because i used to watch clarissa explains it all every day on nickelodeon i loved her then the next thing i found she did a spread in maxim and she was gorgeous i haven't really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident i couldn't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship too bad i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie
<START> triumph of love is proof that not every comÃ©die franÃ§aise author who uses cross dressing disguised courtship like shakespeare is worth seeing br br or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of marivaux a commedia dell arte inspired playwright of whom brittannica says his nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage br br while mira sorvino has fun dangling three mixed up romances her pants role wasn't even up to cherubino in marriage of figaro br br the herky jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech br br best was fiona shaw as the fooled spinster as well as the costumes br br the glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice doesn't really help br br originally written 5 29 2002
<START> i'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review br br given the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another 28 days later or even a blair witch project br br the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i don't think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground br br characters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really don't care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two whether intentional of the writers or not br br the main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match br br all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark br br just to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away
<START> unfortunately because of us viewers' tendency to shun subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of belonging identity racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties transcend the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste's childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents' houseboy perhaps the only real human she knows we won't even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man there i hope i've given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as la p'tite
<START> spooks is enjoyable trash featuring some well directed sequences ridiculous plots and dialogue and some third rate acting br br many have described this is a uk version of 24 and one can see the similarities br br the american version shares the weak silly plots but the execution is so much slicker sexier and i suspect expensive br br some people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy br br this is gentle spy story hour the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre br br give me smiley any day
<START> the coming attractions to the order make it seem like a decent horror mystery thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage br br first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects the acting was also nothing to be proud of but keath ledger i think i spelled that right saved the movie in this category br br for heaven's sake don't see this movie
<START> just get it the dvd is cheap and easy to come by the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it when home video started there were at least three versions with parts missing everything you've read is true there is no defending it and no living without it the color is lush and wonderful to look at and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic but no question the whole santa vs satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway how good bad strange is it i only saw the trailer as a kid and remembered it for nearly 30 years including murray's over the top voice over i told my older sister and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vs satan add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin mary's blessing before setting off on christmas eve kids wanting to capture him and make him their slave and an international kiddie sweat shop and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60's like others here i watch the thing every holiday season now my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition but any old way you choose it the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must along with brianiac by the way it never fails to make me laugh better i think then santa claus conquers the martians parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out how many parents do you know go out for cocktails on christmas eve if you get bored just go downstairs and play the piano dang freaky boring disturbing funny childish strange hey what more can you want
<START> we open with colonel luc deveraux van damme the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond me br br it's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going the united states government has cut the universal soldier's project budget and in the process angered seth the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers naturally he won't be shut down without a fight so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesn't stop it from becoming stupid as hell br br for instance one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg seems you can't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie he's big he's tough right wrong van damme doesn't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him once twice three times the point here lost on me then there's the breaking of glass a rudimentary part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scenes in particular let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck they have seth the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black michael jai white nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem potentially offensive and just downright lame he's no replacement for dolph either br br universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel it's loud it's dumb and it doesn't care the original wasn't anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level the sequel doesn't they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence so give credit where credit is due
<START> bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film having watched the first time i was by how good it was the reviews i had heard were ok as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most however because of paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching especially if you are a horror film fanatic the film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys i give this film 9 10 and i highly recommend that everyone catches it
<START> michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out iphigenia however is a highlight adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods king agamemnon kostas kazakos is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia tatiana papamoschou much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae irene papas kazakos and papas are both outstanding but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game strongly recommended for fans of international cinema
<START> the original boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick it was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind the third instalment in this series return of the boogeyman on the other hand is simply atrocious it consists of two things firstly cheap and lifeless new footage secondly loads of recycled bits from the first movie the new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way simply incredibly tedious this footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort it serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first and possibly second movies and boy do they milk those clips from the earlier films sometimes reusing sequences over and over again the only new addition to these parts is a voice over that pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes the whole experience of watching this is truly mind numbing br br return of the boogeyman is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick the kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way i want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more there is nothing here of value at all this is worthless
<START> bored with the normal run of the mill staple films to watch this halloween that i've seen over and over again i took a chance on the sentinel hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again mind you i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of the house on haunted hill complete and utter crap thankfully the sentinel blew me away in a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn hights the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie 1 campy and fantasically juicy characters exchanges and dialogue including hilaraious turns by christopher walken jeff goldblum and especially martin balsam as an absent minded professor 2 horrifying terror not to give a frame away but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas 3 fantastic gore terrific make up and wacky if very uneven direction from michael winner which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat if you loved evil dead 2 dead alive and deep rising this will be your queen of favourites just to emphasize my love for this film after i watched it for the first time jaw dropped i rewound it and watched it again it is now one of favourites of all time do yourself a favour and check it out
