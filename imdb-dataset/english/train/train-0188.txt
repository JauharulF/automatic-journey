<START> i had to watch this in school and to sum it up br br talentless actors talentless script and a talentless director br br this movie is such a waste of your time don't even watch the movie don't bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the movie's actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and that's not saying much it's has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was unemotional and confusing there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous
<START> this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of t v because of its retardedness it is so dumb i could faint when i watch it even though i never watch it because it is sooooo poor br br goofs when mac says he can t eat sugar in another episode he eats sugar almost everything in the world has sugar in it in episode eddie monster when eddy screams at terrance he falls into the crate twice plus the seconed time he falls in he doesn't fall in he falls off to the side what stupidity i can't even say the word fosters home i even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is byyyyyyyyeeeee
<START> i liked this movie although halfway through it i was able to tell who the secret admirer was br br i am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the real people at the end of the movie i guess i will have to research it and let ya know br br does anyone remember what state this happened in i believe they moved to north carolina if i'm not mistaken br br of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent br br you would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as i did was he stupid or what
<START> and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing the acting and sound is awful this might qualify for a so bad it's good point of merit for some however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap it's just soooo cheap i think that's my major complaint the dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times you startled me is used the child actress is seriously god awful i pray her acting career ended here her line donuts i hate donuts is worth repeated viewing however
<START> this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film almost silencing all others coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners the weekly claridad is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film's form and content and pointed out all its flaws clichÃ©s and bad writing br br just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes and because one can recognize actors and scenery does not make it an acceptable film
<START> my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998 and so we happily bought the tickets the popcorn and soda and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie when it was over the audience didn't applauded strongly i remember that i heard a few people say that they didn't like it at all i didn't like it i thought that it was rather stupid and not worth seeing eddie murphy was hysterical in this but apart from him the whole movie was bad i rarely laughed at the parts in this i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk because talking animals only exist in cartoons in live action movies they are totally a mutt i said that apart from eddie murphy's hysterical twist he brings in this movie is not worth watching it is rather stupid br br i have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie i also have not seen eddie murphy in the really great movie the adventures of pluto nash this movie is not a movie that i would really recommend that you see because apart from eddie murphy you probably are not going to like this especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it br br i'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars
<START> this movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable it was very low budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video it wasn't even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the 1 1 2 hours back the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them br br the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing what a stretch skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this br br ejames6342
<START> i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood's novel 'the robber bride' and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an ex cop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends it's fortunate that the movie script fixes ms atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women br br heh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and i'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie i'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man's life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to a man because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them br br i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadn't read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you're out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot it's the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst it's like zenia's revenge on margaret atwood
<START> i can't understand why so many peoples praised this show twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life br br now i have seen all season 1 episodes and seeing season 2 episode 1 simply i can't take this show anymore br br 1 where is the proper induction in criminal investigation br br in season 1 there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle can you guess why he did that he just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream wow br br 2 there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show br br for example season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor he got the gun shoots in his belly already this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments that's all br br this scene is really boring and even long 3 min 30 sec it's like hell br br i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore
<START> this film uses all art house clichÃ©s slow pace long static shots minimal amount of dialog to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here there is no plot to speak of the characters are dreary female lead or clichÃ© tersteeghe's character and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives the film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery instead of confronting him she half heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself after a fight and a reconciliation with her sister who knew about the adultery without telling her she asks her husband to stop cheating on her they seem to be re united as a family two other story lines the planned move of the woman's elderly father with his young wife to guernsey and the rivalry with the woman's sister do not offer any interesting developments the suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself for 2005 or any other year for that matter this is not enough to make an interesting film br br moreover what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past over much more important things than furniture men this could in theory lead to a confrontation or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other either way this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development the film clearly sets this situation up with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws but it cheats us out of any resolution the scene simply ends and how this in itself rather dreary and materialistic issue is solved is not shown br br although almost completely absent the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid for example when during a visit to guernsey the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish yes it is no it isn't ring to it the fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog giving a highly artificial overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact the way the woman finally finally addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed and is at the same time completely unbelievable the husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any it is not shown the woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband the scene showing the woman husband and their young son asleep on an airliner watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely br br because of its slow pace uninteresting story leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog i found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art house movie and a complete waste of time
<START> if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone br br the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion which takes place in a supposed abandon high school looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge br br john hughes falls in love with his characters too much as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady goonies' anne ramsey we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed but never see a blasted thing this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s
<START> ok if you're a woman who's got aggression issues you might like this movie hate your significant other this movie is for you for the guys it will be a bag of laughs br br it's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies br br the only really good part is the last 10 seconds even that was a load of cheese br br my wife is picking the worst movies lately this is what you get i for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites
<START> i know i know it's childish but i just love this type of movie a bird that suffered a lot of mishaps and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor what's special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie the parrot and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor furthermore i like the storyline paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom by the way jay mohr's voice almost sounds like joe pesci's and cheech marin of course the man is humor to me ever since i saw up in smoke i have appreciated his naive way of performing making a simple situation a hilarious one can't help myself
<START> portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde she likes him too but not for the reasons you might think little seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon yet it makes no lasting impact it's just a quickie throwaway effort helmed by norman bates himself anthony perkins even on the level of b comedies the somewhat similar eating raoul is a better bet there's definitely an amusing set up here unfortunately the picture has nowhere to go in its second act an interesting try but it misfires br br from
<START> it's rare that i come across a film this awful this annoying and this irritating it is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen br br the plot when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing is ludicrous why did domino become such a bad ass tough bitch because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this traumatic event left her emotionally stunted and hating everyone when the dialogue is not clichÃ©d or banal it's littered with laughable lines such as there are three kinds of people in this world the rich the poor and everyone else at one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm because of a confusing mobile phone call instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number they blow off his arm with a shotgun at another point the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy br br keira knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast mickey rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess br br i have enjoyed some of tony scott's previous films true romance being one but all i could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot
<START> average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance br br the genre's well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair br br fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look br br 3 out of 10 limping killers
<START> i thought this was a sequel of some sorts and it is meant to be to the original from 1983 but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it br br i actually had very little expectations to this movie but i just wasted 95 minutes of life no suspense i actually feel clairvoyant poor acting and so filled with technical errors so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie br br do not see this movie this is a complete waste of time instead get the original the theme is still valid don't let to much power into a machine and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling
<START> i enjoyed longstreet which followed in the steps of raymond burr's successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided i believe wrongly that longstreet was not able to compete with mr burr's ironside br br i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear br br writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv
<START> this very good movie crackles with tension the stakes are of course high will the police and widmark the public health doctor apprehend the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full scale epidemic breaks out but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between widmark and the police captain between the bad guys played by palance and mostel between palance and a dying plague stricken man whom palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity between widmark and his wife and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full scale panic the movie is beautifully shot by kazan in extraordinarily well choreographed long takes shot on location in new orleans and ends in a stunning climax where palance flees like a rat from his pursuers through the docks and warehouses of the city the commentary is superb probably the best that i've heard covering the cinematography the framing and lighting of shots the production design the casting of non professional actors in small roles and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally watch it once to enjoy the film on its own and if you are interested in film making a second time with the commentary on to learn
<START> this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the whole little man crap is just so stupid the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb let's face it it's just a black comedy this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous please i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of who writes this crap the actors have no talent what so ever how do these people get into hollywood they are making money off this junk
