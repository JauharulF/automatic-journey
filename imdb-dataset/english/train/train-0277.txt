<START> it's not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoeven's original pants down shocker it always struck me as a glossy well made airport novel of a movie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist after a decade of anti sex aids induced hysteria a film about a wildly sexual hotbod who thrill kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort of be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch let's state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell what was so photogenic thru verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun for hire michael caton jones who's flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career bi2 could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffed shirt david morrissey their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his dough faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orange skin machismo of michael douglas supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichÃ© heavy posturing and what of the much touted sexual shenanigans poorly lit fleetingly glimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed don't watch this film for carnal thrills there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2 as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception as a multi million dollar piece of hollywood film making it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst
<START> as a veteran of many many pretentious french films i thought i'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything but not this pointless relentless violent unpleasant meaningless the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art avoid at all costs
<START> this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so called scares that are about as shocking as peewee's playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige's character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie
<START> basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called spaced invaders
<START> this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent the production is above average for 1936 timeframe i cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on dvd owners please please release it i would buy it immediately i have not seen it in more than thirty years on television but remember it well
<START> i always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender especially when they obviously don't do enough research to find out when something not only doesn't ring true but rings blatently false br br the scene i am remembering is the one in the bathroom where jack tells his football teammates that he got diane pregnant in no way shape or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school they might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader but i can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a urinal br br it was obvious that this film didn't take itself so seriously and it wasn't hideously bad but come on
<START> this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see the narrow minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world' the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate though they insist that the film makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action br br the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church did organise vetoes of minorities before protestants it was the jews br br the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
<START> this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5 why not it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most like our churches the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians thanks fox for producing it as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith
<START> paul reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family what we see and what we don't see what we expect and what surprises us the thing about my folks doesn't set any new standards for film but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents br br sam kleinman peter falk has been a workaholic at times pushing his wife muriel olympia dukakis his daughters mackenzie connolly and lydia jordan and his son ben paul reiser into the background one day muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving her daughters along with ben's wife rachel elizabeth perkins immediately begin the search for her whereabouts leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle sam to sort things out on a road trip with son ben the road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic ben to the pleasures and fun of living the trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending all is not what it seemed it's better and well different br br falk and reiser play off each other like the pros they are but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when olympia dukakis is on screen reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film well worth viewing grady harp
<START> walt disney his 9 old men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial fairy tale princess trilogy from the classic disney years br br the plot cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break she is the daughter of a nice wealthy widower who loved her dearly but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young and cindy's father felt she needed a mother figure so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella anastasia and drizella at first they all seemed to get along but then cinderella's father died and lady tremaine's true nature was revealed she was a cold cruel callous heartless mean spirited woman and she passed those traits on to her daughters who were spoiled bratty and equally mean spirited anastasia drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall nicer more attractive lady than themselves i e more appealing to men and their mother lady tremaine hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve refine her awkward unattractive daughters to call them homely would be an insult to homely people everywhere while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi tasking servant of the house abusing her mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload that brings us to cinderella in the present where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor br br cinderella gets her shot at freedom happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife settle down start a family etc naturally her step family tries to keep her from attending even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself with a little help from her mice friends the dress belonged to her biological mother finally pushed beyond her breaking point cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair it is at that point that her fairy godmother a short plump jolly woman arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress after all cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped cindy arrives at the ball the prince falls hard for her but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way forcing her to flee but leaving behind a glass slipper make a long story short after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper cinderella is found and she and the prince get married giving her the happy ending she deserves br br overall an enjoyable disney classic not without its flaws the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along he has very little screen time and even less dialogue so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella which is unfortunate since according to the making of documentary the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful still cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine even if she is upstaged by her mice friends and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days of course if this were being made now cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window but this is beside the point br br and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls well consider this at least cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed unlike some modern day princesses you know who i mean
<START> young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again this time it involves mobile phones various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied br br the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera so far i've been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo cronenberg style of audition despite a lot of his films being essentially empty at least they do have merits such as these or at least something to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating johnny depp there's none of that in one missed call there's just very little of credit the acting is bland and average there is very little nothing in all honesty in the way of scares or suspense and in places it's just downright boring br br however there are moments where miike's glacier like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects and the tv programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace and that includes his famous gore although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project and i can understand why one missed call isn't offensively bad it's just frustratingly average br br miike obviously loves directing with his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100 concerned about all his projects but even with this in mind one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills
<START> feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other we haven't seen stuff like this since godzilla v king kong and the like always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like beethoven's symphonies then you come to writing it great ideas like all vampires are female ergo hot seductive deadly but in a way i want to perish sort of way and all zombies are men well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right so it all looks good up to actually making it then the rot starts to set in mosters have fight nothing much happens another fight philosophical noodling and cods wallop eureka we've found how to win big fight again and the end sounds great doesn't it if it was made an indie company it would be great but this is hollywood with the eye on the bucks gloss instead of what the fans want it all could have been gore soaked beautiful
<START> i rented this film from netflix for two reasons i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci fi asco and because it is the first feature length superman film needless to say after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised br br an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation a day later strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six mile deep home near the earth's core br br supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well made piece of social realism released in 1951 starring a lead actor who served in world war ii the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point br br even in the 1950s the science underlying this film was nonexistent six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle let alone the hollow center of the earth which in any case does not exist forgivable keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book br br the film is a little unevenly paced although the molemen are interesting a bit creepy and nicely portrayed there are several corman esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior the script is intelligent and economical by today's standards the costuming is poor to fair but for its time this film's special effects and costuming were quite good the cinematography is also generally very good and the acting is much better than one might expect i was particularly impressed with reeves jeff corey and walter reed
<START> the bubble is an effort to make a gay romeo juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian although it seems to come at it by way of friends or beverly hills 90210 the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line the movie seems torn between fluff and depth on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as in one example of many some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand and get answers like hey we're here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation don't get political beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line it's just one of many ham fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests on the other hand the movie's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of bent a play about gays in a nazi labor camp the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed undermining its erotic power understandable given the constraints of film time but still this could have been edited to much better effect and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film too bad this play deserves much better br br the characters are so one dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire though the word seems inappropriate here substance the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named golan the militant palestinian is named jihad the striving for chic faghag roommate is lulu anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal asÂ well the rest of this fluffy fantasy when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful an ambulance shows up in minutes the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance not the series of bone numbing soul crushing humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth death or severe illness ashraf the palestinian lover seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems no papers no hassles he just shows up whenever he likes when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardo br br against the backdrop of nice supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose Â except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers br br gay israeli palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleem's salaam shalom so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think br br gloriously bad films Â like the works of ed wood at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them this one doesn't even have that going for it most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tv movie of the week
<START> one of the great classic comedies not a slapstick comedy not a heavy drama a fun satirical film a buyers beware guide to a new home br br filled with great characters all of whom cary grant is convinced are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home br br a great look at life in the late 40's br br
<START> strummer's hippie past was a revelation but overall this felt like crashing a wake campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire there were just too many semi boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage i love the clash and joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now fu mick jones but this doc left me wanting to relate more using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent they should have been interviewed on their own even using strummer's 'radio dj voice' did little to glue the film together and can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes after the awesome filth and the fury i hoped temple could deliver a joe strummer doc deserves better
<START> loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager the movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter the progression of situations were cleverly written making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious too bad there have to be commercials i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue husband and wife heated discussions or should i say fights were very realistic the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film thank you looking forward to the next films when whidbey
<START> this is an early film pilot for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series i highly recommend it br br rated r for swearing violence and drug use br br its not too offensive either they dont actually show killing animals
