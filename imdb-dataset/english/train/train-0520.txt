<START> having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it well i don't know why i bothered basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure hidden by the knights templar during the war of independence apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs firstly why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america how did nic cages character figure out that 'charlotte' was in fact a ship how do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong cage has been in some great action movies 'face off' and 'the rock' so why has he lowered himself to this is he getting too old his character is pretty annoying really somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the declaration of independancd outruns thieves with guns escapes from the fbi and generally seems invincible the whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment
<START> maybe it's because i looked up the history of the irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad civil war that engulfed the free state after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie anyway the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes br br victor mclaglen isn't as famous today as he was back then and he should be better remembered in this film i think he's playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains for example the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what mclaglen actually did in earlier years when he was a world class bare knuckles boxer john ford is partly responsible for that the imdb trivia section shows how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene this director also could bring out a lot in his actors even without such tricks mostly though mclaglen is firmly in control especially when his character is almost totally blotto which is difficult for an actor to do believably and he also plays gypo nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen mclaglen later in his career in the quiet man i especially like the contrast between this role as an ira man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the ira man denis hogan in hangman's house br br in the quiet man of course mclaglen is a country squire at odds with the local ira victor mclaglen was big and bully in the old fashioned sense of the word but he was a good actor too and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn't expect of a such a man today it's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices br br ford as usual packs a lot into a little bit of film all the characters are excellent though the commandant's mostly american accent is distracting note there be spoilers ahead knowing that gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing gypo and the humanity he shows most notably when they go to take gypo in mary's room br br john ford really shows his genius here taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of gypo and the other characters but of poor ireland during that tortured time
<START> watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole br br without giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves br br the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u s br br the film is lighthearted you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe all of the film's characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfections br br i've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what i think so because now i'm really geeked to give it a try br br watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again br br why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery as it is perfect as is
<START> renown writer mark redfield as edgar allen poe tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself as a baltimore maryland magazine publisher however blackouts delirium and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts he would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart a significantly flawed prospect as things turns out mr redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of edgar allen poe redfield employs a lot of black and white color and trick photography to create mood kevin g shinnick as dr john moran performs well relatively speaking it's not enough
<START> i thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism this movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable the acting was top notch and the movie reminded me of one flew over the cuckoo's nest
<START> spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the 80's i enjoyed this movie it's plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
<START> i was really disappointed in this movie those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose the acting was ok kinda wooden and cardboard the ending was sorry i just didn't care for this at all br br no way could i recommend this mess
<START> this movie is great brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie duchovny was top notch as was forbes and lewis the 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever made 1960's model lincoln continental early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage he likes his women to not curse or smoke and wear pwt dresses duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts even though the majority tone in the film is dark there are plenty of funny scenes to be had the writing directing and acting are brilliant if you like road movies murder humor and narration watch this film everyone delivers and you will want more when the credits roll one of my all time favorites hey shave that dog n teach it to hunt

<START> this is a short crudely animated series by david lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods overall wearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes and there's no real plot to be seen it's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre looney tunes with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity br br i bought the dvd along with eraserhead having previously seen eraserhead don't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece this is anything but in fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see as lynch says if this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all
<START> this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kid film however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the screen's greatest actors diminishes himself in this i gave it two points just because mr hurt showed up i take away 8 points because he didn't run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so it's so bad it almost hurts
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining alice's smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie
<START> this movie is about human relationships charming funny and well written with meaningful text it seems that morgan freeman surely have fun at the set also good music paz vega is a beautiful and smart woman i really enjoy her acting woman like her are a good motivation to learn spanish language from the moment morgan freeman meets the cute paz vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed 10 items or less is about zest of life if you enjoy this film see also the pursuit of happiness with will smith and his son thats not a action film or a nude comedy its all about human relations
<START> if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10 i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better the production values are incredible and the acting is first rate i don't mind that it doesn't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it they are two different shows i'm thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all time faves eric stoltz are back in my life if only weekly as i've missed them both this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray both literally and figuratively in plot lines characters and of course the various virtual worlds we all know how it ends but the journey is looking to be quite a ride
<START> what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm homeless people answer to no one they have no mortgages rent payments or idiot bosses homeless people don't have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments but give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for transportation paying insurance on their car and working for someone else they get a chance to be a productive citizens this film was about as exploitive as a film can be it's a way for the rich and middle class sheeple to say see what happens when you try to help the poor and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance br br why not a film that asks what happens when you take away everything a rich man has
<START> story says that on that on december 28 1895 a small group of thirty three people was gathered at paris's salon indien du grand cafÃ© to witness the cinÃ©matographe a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumiÃ¨re the small audience reunited that day some by invitation most due to curiosity didn't really know what to expect from the show and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen most thought that the cinÃ©matographe was just another fancy devise to present slide show projections until the photograph started to move what those thirty three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day br br of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day la sortie des usines lumiÃ¨re literally exiting the lumiÃ¨re factory was the very first to be screened the film shows the many workers of the lumiÃ¨re factory as they walk through the gates of the factory leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work while a very basic actuality film movie depicting a real event the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edison's peep show machines the kinetoscope the brothers' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe as the people and the horses moved across the screen the idea wasn't entirely new le prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary br br la sortie des usines lumiÃ¨re would become the first in the long series of actuality films that the lumiÃ¨re would produce over the years this primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cinÃ©matographe could have despite the initial lack of enthusiasm after the first showing the cinÃ©matographe became a great success and la sortie des usines lumiÃ¨re quickly became an iconic image of that first screening it definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day personally i think that l' arroseur arrosÃ© was the best of the 10 however it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates as literally this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it 8 10
<START> this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white girls would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they wouldn't the characters know no limits check my lyrics and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun there are so many funny sketches my favorites is the bob the builder one it's so silly it's genius if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn't 3 non blonde's is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced
<START> a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end
<START> this film is beautiful to look at but is like watching really bad experimental theater the plot if there was one doesn't make any sense but it is very artistic lots of shots of half dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame mumbling and people wandering wistfully lingering close ups of faces and bodies by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat you'll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the screen br br it is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f each other and get it over with if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots your wish has been granted
<START> claire denis's movies seem to fall into one of two categories the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate l'intrus definitely falls into the first category but it's not so awful as trouble every day or j'ai pas sommeil br br now ever since i saw chocolat i've made it a point to see every new movie denis makes and i have always been disappointed l'intrus was no exception she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one br br you get a lot of the denis regulars an older but still magnificent bÃ©atrice dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats the black guy from trouble every day and j'ai pas sommeil grÃ©goire colin and that lithuanian or russian girl michel subor's character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in korea i think he finally got it cut br br there was certainly some action gruesome murders a man's search for a son and there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out and two viewings are i fear out of the question for one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive as in beau travail for another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked friday evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of l'intrus otherwise steer clear br br i saw this movie in french and it's possible i missed something crucial but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins in chocolat the silence is sublime in l'intrus it's just dull
