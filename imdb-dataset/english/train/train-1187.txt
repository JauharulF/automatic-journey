<START> spoilers maybe a few details but nothing too plot related not like it would matter with this movie br br air rage blatantly rips off the mid air infiltration premise of executive decision ice t leads a team of four elite commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd graders use when playing star wars on the playground lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire br br what entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look alike has been actors you'll immediately recognize cyril o'reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it it was porky's here cyril plays a decent knock off of a bill paxton character most hilarious is porker gil gerard who's so fat that you will never recognize him as tv's buck rogers instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona which was clearly imagineered for john goodman finally alex cord gives us a nice hybrid look alike performance as a chuck connors kirk douglas type in the 10 years since new jack city ice t's acting has deteriorated remarkably it's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized br br one of the items that plays into this movie is a cd rom of classified information it's being hand carried and it's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted despite the security savvy aura of gerard's nsa character what a joke i'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the cd would ever even all be assembled into a portable format br br despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers the gunfire is about as loud as canned air and causes nary a person to flinch so apparently no foley budget the assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny the flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film when she takes intuitively to the mini uzi pistol which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever that's just too stupid a true elite team would carry mp 5s for this type thing or maybe socomm 45s or even customized hi powers if they were really old school or maybe something fn 5 7 if new school the lame o standard issue 92fs are totally unbelievable having lost most of their cool after lethal weapon i the bad guys supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types have an assorted mixture of absurdity like the aforementioned mini uzi pistol and a tec 9 with the infamous non functional barrel extender that isn't a silencer br br there was one touch of realism on which i would like to correct the other reviewers the flight attendant and ice t did lower the craft to 10 000 feet for breathable air before they opened the door and i also got the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed that she basically just gave up on that point as far as the landing there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown sigh br br only the dukes of hazard eluding roscoe p coltrane at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage they obviously chose the incredible and retired sr 71 because they couldn't get stock of an f 117 aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001 let's also forget for a moment that the sr 71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the b 2 and that at point blank range well i'm no expert but i'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on radar br br as others have pointed out the repeated references to f 15s when they were showing f 16s was laughable details of the 747 were pretty stupid no airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring br br wow what a show catch it on stars or something don't pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs in contention for worst movie ever right up there with no holds barred which at least had some originality
<START> sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survive but they can only use virgins it's not explained why charles brady brian krause is one such who needs to feed his mother mary alice krige he goes after likable tanya madchen amick will she escape br br on one hand this is a great horror film fast paced plenty of blood and gore and a nice twisted sense of humor there are plenty of in joke references for horror buffs castle rock is mentioned once also krause is excellent who would have thought he could act after return to the blue lagoon as is kirge and amick but i find this film annoying br br it was written for the screen by stephen king and it's maddeningly vague the sleepwalkers are never fully explained where are they from why are they called that why does the son have to feed the mother why do cats hate them and can kill them what are their powers after all at one point krause makes a car disappear and change color and style why do they need to feed off peoples' life force why does it have to be only virgins why is the son having sex with his mom none of these are explained leaving the story confusing it's really too bad because those questions aside this is an excellent horror film excellent makeup and special effects too br br fast gory and lots of fun if only the script were better also a fairly explicit sex scene between krause and krige was edited you can tell to get an r rating i can only give this a 7

<START> i saw a preview of freebird at the isle of man tt as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags although i was over mainly for the racing the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else proved enough to get me away from the beer and partying at last we've done it us british have actually made a great motorcycle film and no it's not like torque this is up there with the best of british comedy mark my words this is phil daniels best screen performance and as far as geoff bell is concerned there's a new british legend making his name felt i loved gary stretch in shane meadows' fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation this is a film not just for us bikers but i think for everyone even my girlfriend loved it i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of man i'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has watch out for the shop as it would spoil the fun but i would say go see enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while i really think this could well be a cult classic as they were saying at the tt c'mon freebird
<START> i just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film i have done on the net i felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films i have ever seen after reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible br br 1 the actors i know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average br br 2 the incredibly lame make up and special effects once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse br br 3 the obvious similarities to hostel whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success only problem is roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there br br 4 the music not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying br br 5 the script in general all dialogue was forced and terrible also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought br br 6 the editing wtf how jarring and not in a good way nuf said br br seriously i would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post he no doubt frequents his pages on imdb cause buddy what were you thinking surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands sorry i don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better hopefully practice makes progress br br but in the mean time avoid this like the plague i want my 81 mins back with interest at least i didn't pay to watch it
<START> a first time director bromell has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged middle class depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h macy is the most refreshing little actor i've seen in awhile macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business it's always great to see donald sutherland and here he's wonderful as the callous father of macy the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast locations and filmed the movie the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of contradiction
<START> this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid 40s chuck jones' was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare 1946 and rabbit punch 1948 for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
<START> first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alone br br don't let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin' with rick baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of grease br br the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilarious br br the hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man's cast br br essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick baker's disgusting effects getting the lion's share of whatever was spent on this br br sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why can't people have made more movies like these br br 8 10
<START> i have seen the freebird movie and think its great its laid back fun about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents nice touch the acting was convincing i am a biker they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting well done jon at the end a new crop gets mentioned in ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters
<START> this is a great movie i love it more each time i watch most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo or hank azaria says good bye to louise lasser or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens is a pleasure this is pitch perfect ensemble acting the story develops directly and consistently the action sequences are creative and not too dominant all the set ups payoff by the end seriously if you've seen it and it's been a while watch it again and if you haven't then get started you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time wes studi william h macy the tryouts scene too much good stuff
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies of all time br br low production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and i can't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan river's directing is i know that there's a special place in hell for the people who financed this film prolly right below the level reserved for child raping genocidal maniacs br br this movie is a trainwreck br br terrible x infinity rabbit test br br avoid this at all costs br br it's so bad it isn't even funny how bad it is
<START> when george c scott played the title role in patton you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist shooting at german dive bombers with a revolver and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike the most action we get from gregory peck as macarthur a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his br br comparing peck's performance with scott's may be unfair yet the fact macarthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at west point it's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that oscar winning film of a few years before but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a wikipedia walkthrough of macarthur's later career br br to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us it's a typical dishwater bit of post vietnam sophistry about those who led america's military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view macarthur as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life br br director joseph sargent who went on to helm the famous turkey jaws the revenge does a paint by numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the chinese attack u s forces in korea while the script by hal barwood and matthew robbins trots out a macarthur who comes across as good natured to the point of blandness a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decent br br here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the phillipines there you see him addressing congress in his old soldiers never die speech for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in toyko waiting for the north koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule peck's co actors marj dusay as his devoted wife you're my finest soldier and nicolas coaster as a loyal aide burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no interest on their own br br even when he argues with others peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence when admiral nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the philippines a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for macarthur macarthur comes back with the comment just now as i listened to his plan i thought i saw our flag going down doubtless the real nimitz would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of president roosevelt br br the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously disagrees with is harry s truman who ed flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble toucan sam truman's firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a genial martyr br br i've never been sold by peck's standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best known roles but it's unfair to dock him so much here as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a speechifying bore except for two scenes one where he rails against the surrender of the philippines he struck old glory and ran up a bedsheet and another where he has a mini breakdown while awaiting the u s invasion of inchon inveighing against communists undermining him at the white house peck really plays peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet american caesar the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown
<START> the youthful group in st elmo's fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation with a now outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on 1 2 from
<START> i can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6 9 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her it was also very touching to see that although amrita's family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while shahids family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything all in all this movie deserved an 8 10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made
<START> just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this film br br nobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the 1920s br br this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true history br br i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right with this br br why was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins br br this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck
<START> relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a 1 awful i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train crash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next br br another reviewer suggested that it was falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money it's a wonder they didn't murder him
<START> i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steve's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script don't go if you must see it wait for the video
<START> its about time that gunga din is released on dvd i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but i never tire of it the lead actors worked so well together victor mclaglen sgt mcchesney cary grant sgt cutter and douglas fairbanks jr sgt ballentine are an unbeatable team br br i just cannot get over their exploits in india your first glimpse at the sergeants three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so called treasure map the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town or so they think br br they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few residents in hiding soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base br br later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din and they are too captured br br faced with being killed they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush in doing this din is shot dead br br the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them at the end din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army
<START> the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far it's like a good pilot for a tv series i even think it's a little bit cult like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino's magic or something they have caught a great deal of modesty's character but i admit missing willy garwin a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 so i may have overrate this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one can't wait for a follow up
<START> i haven't read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged i'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn't make much sense to me even when i rewatched them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also poor little rich girl which was tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long so i'm relieved to see that i wasn't crazy there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense br br it's hard to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time it's the earliest film i've personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges' films he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william s hart who warwick does resemble somewhat after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris kenyon and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now br br again i'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesn't hold up much as a movie and isn't a particularly good example of maurice tourneur's work
