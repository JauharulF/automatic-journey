<START> just saw a pre screening tonight what can i say it lived up to it's mediocre trailer run though that's saying nothing at all it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done and it played out in such a clichÃ© fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience and instead let the humorless movie play out br br so let's see we have the less than spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex girlfriend but he's not good enough for her check we have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24 7 and is thrown in for the one liners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from disney and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen check we have the girl's ex boyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side check we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check we have the movie's funny moments come from incessant swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual innuendos check and dare i call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie check br br honestly this could have no wait should have been a pg 13 movie all that needed to be dropped were any f bombs honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r rated comedies like superbad and knocked up the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera let's put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing when this movie hits showtime and you're checking it out at 2 00 pm on an off day you may be inclined to change the channel the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eve's hotness who is not quite a 10 but still very good looking br br aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window so there is a main resolution but what comes of it it's never really clear cut nor does it allow the ending to be feel good with the abruptness br br there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up compose i'll give them props for a great choice of sound br br one last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it but i say hold onto your money if this was pg 13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends i'd say knock yourselves out otherwise definitely pass it doesn't try and compete with the r rated movies of the past few years and ideally it definitely isn't as good
<START> if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror don't bother with gawi the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a list work such as ringu a tale of two sisters cure and ju on or even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films brim with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly non western take on what's frightening gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty five years br br the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but it's a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to smother the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil child subplot but the situation is hopeless clichÃ©s crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum
<START> i once used wesley snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untried film in which he appears so now for the first time my snipes method of film recommendation has failed utterly i should first have come here to see these reviews br br snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in the contractor br br one of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition i feared that the shaky blurry pseudo documentary unconsidered directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the paul greengrass directed bloody sunday might propagate to other films greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films my fear had come to pass in my opinion these films are made really bad by these motion sickness inducing methods which mistake blurry swipes for action enhancement but the bourne franchise as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow apparently convinced others in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast big bucks br br read my lips you hollywood types action needs to be clearly photographed and presented not merely hinted at by poor lazy cinematographic techniques br br and the contractor goes so far as to emulate the bourne ultimatum in inanely repeated sound bites in hopes their juvenile apparently evaluated audiences can't sense them for example if i hear a cop radio crackling yankee romeo one more time i'll just scream the chances are good i won't hear it again i certainly won't ever view the contractor again br br i recommend to those of you who have yet to see the contractor just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life br br 2 out of 10 i am tempted to lower that to a 1
<START> this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner br br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie 'beauty' can be only experienced in bob ross style kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending e g at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' quote br br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades
<START> the plot is rocky the acting is somewhere south of a jr high school play the cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete i couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film think death valley days meets mayberry rfd people running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick draw 6 gun rigs it has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house and parking the ford mustang right in front of a hitching rail picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western hemisphere movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub titles it's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote it's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie clichÃ© you can think of there's even a modern version of the good hearted dance hall girl and a twanging jew's harp in the soundtrack really if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session tell 'em your dvd player died
<START> time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds they're fun to consider in a 'what if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek first contact' the 'back to the future' trilogy 'bill and ted's excellent adventure' 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage 'window of opportunity' heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film '12 monkeys' it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
<START> having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80 of that time in complete disbelief i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks' but the acting was dire for those who pay to see this i hope you get your money back for those who were paid to do this i hope you give your money back believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much much better go see
<START> i enjoyed this film it was lighthearted delightful and very colorful you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film every scene is packed full the choreography was great gene kelly is a wonder he is so talented the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else the last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive what makes this film very special is gershwin's music few american composers have had a better gift for melody i very much enjoy gershwin's music it is enchanting ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers he is so witty and charming this was a highly entertaining film
<START> as with most of the reviewers i saw this on starz ondemand after watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story it's best to pass over this one br br major spoilers ahead after making their first video for their as yet unfinished cd the lead singer cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her 3 months later the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not to try and see what cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers dr meso and try to contact her through him in his card reading dr meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members bad times are ahead i just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the death card really just represents change kudos to them on that at least even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album but while in the bathroom cassidy's best friend dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend when another band mate goes in to check on her dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses that's when the killing begins br br my main problem with the film from the very get go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film an incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either while the narrative hangs together for the first part once cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart we have jump cuts between cassidy and dr meso who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building which show they are connected in some way or another however within a few minutes of that revelation we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker but not in a good way br br from this point on the whereabouts of cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next she's nowhere to be found as he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway then in another room grabbing the keys which neil already has then back again not to mention that from one moment to the next cassidy's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it one moment she wants to kill everyone although she's only wounded 90 of the characters the next she's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again sound confusing that's because it is it's a jumbled mess that i'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out br br as for the performances most are particularly wooden some though are interesting but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting the story is the driving force behind this piece
<START> seriously avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid non refundable money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad ones br br it's one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone you get out of the car and die actually it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get trumpets we were promised guns that's the way it is that's the way it'll stay argh okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me br br additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited Â it just didn't work at least not on any level used as a measure for films br br i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans and that's saying something if you like stereotypes which i don't it's nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks i'm not being pc enough br br instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand einstein's theories convert to a different religion and back in fact go and listen to last christmas by wham on endless repeat anything but don't watch this awful flick
<START> that's what one of the girls said at the end br br is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls or more broadly a free thinking group and the authority to germany means to a future that's of hope br br it's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i've ever had despite the crude cinematography and plot and mild over acting though i like the cast they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs the ridiculous situation is well captured i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game being female and a soccer fan and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise i wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided defeating the flawed reasons for the deny br br the movie is very cleverly made the amazing title the filming during the actual game the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters the game that's so important but inaccessible not shown the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium the confinement of the van and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside i can feel the comfort coming from the radio the drinks and the food and of course the kindness and consideration from each character to others during the end credits i am amused that no character has a name he's just any soldier and she's just any girl or sister
<START> i bought this it was only 3 ok under the title grey matter the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non dukesofhazzard role intrigued me as the other reviewers warned it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry br br and yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings it's actually kinda funny after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo reminding us that we are watching grey matter br br i also enjoyed two bouts of name calling at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a scientific b tch it's just a very inadequate insult several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that scientific b tard it just sounded very awkward to me br br someday this movie will disappear forever another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it almost like it never happened br br
<START> well where do i begin my story i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie br br well i figured out within the first 20 minutes what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap and so was the script the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically br br the cast couldn't have been more plastic looking even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker like they dragged on for no particular reason very poor editing br br all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo
<START> if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably 'delirious' you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy's 'delirious' and 'raw' not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that i'm older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard that's the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful Â and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old Â but once upon a time he was the king and 'delirious' was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time
<START> ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i can't recall ever watching one i also don't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i don't know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates how sad is that this wasn't the greatest baseball movie it wasn't supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile
<START> not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with i'm still undecided sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better br br 4 10 but the best of my 4 out of 10's
<START> this had a great cast with big name stars like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939 br br now the bad news regrettably i can't say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light and hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well that's the film world for you evil is good good is bad br br hey hollywood here's a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up
<START> at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6 5 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise br br you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch br br the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining br br the movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun br br a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more br br 8 10
<START> big spoilers i've seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal 'audition' which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in 'visitor q' which i think means 'visitor question' he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miike's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and film making but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family pride br br and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it's has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and over the top in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camera work is sloppy and doesn't have that cinematic feel that lynch's work entails it's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems self aware that it's trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miike's previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot 'visitor q' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process br br out of
<START> i am a massive fan of jet li he is the best hk action film star alive and consequently this film rocked i saw it in the video store and as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store i didnt register its presence at first and had to look twice i immediately knew what i would be renting out my only qualm i suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed aaargh and not subtitled elsewise the movie's original strange cool plot and full on action made it one of jet li's better movies even though they all fall under that category
