<START> great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first half br br hour or so i was really wanting to know what was going to br br happen to each of these unredeeming characters and how their br br seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined but when br br the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players they br br mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill br br for the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it only br br got worse don't believe the reviews this is a waste of time br br think about it tom cruise made ugly why the gorgeous br br hunky bartender wearing braces why i know it had to do with br br the plot but without them at least there would have been one br br attractive cast member to remember
<START> if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children if you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case this movie was horrible main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute i wish i had never seen this movie it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left do yourself a favor go see something worth your money cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back
<START> just kidding i rented 12 monkeys the other day because i am a huge bruce willis fan and i heard some things about the film some good and some bad but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second so i was a bit worried just because i felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that i had to watch several times to get but i watched it last night and i was really impressed this movie had everything in it action drama sci fi history dark humor and even a little romance the actors all did a terrific job i give a lot of credit to bruce during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist he really got to me but brad pitt i'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did he didn't over do his character who was crazy and just made it work and was extremely believable the story was just scary but very good and a wake up call br br james cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1 of the population survived including him animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below but scientists send james to the past of 1990 really meaning to send him to '96 to find out about information of the virus james gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist dr kathryn raily and another mental patient jeffrey goines he tells them the future of course no one believes him he goes back to the future but the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by james but he tells her more and believes him now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening br br 12 monkeys was an incredible film like i said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening but the whole movie was just great the cast the sets just the whole picture was a great one it had a terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day ourselves if we don't listen to others what is right and what is wrong who knows but i would highly recommend 12 monkeys it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance i'm sure you'll enjoy it br br 9 10
<START> what i love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it's a blast to experience their everyday love humor and adventure the literature of magic is so diverse portraying the ideas of classical medieval and modern wizardry like harry potter and sabrina with sabrina the teenage witch this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry seven seasons worth this show has so many great qualities and it's a joy to watch sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and other realm i would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean funny and adventurous classic
<START> i just love malle's documentaries they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating i have no idea why this documentary works it is about glencoe minnesota 5000 people live there and nothing happens really but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting his love for humanity even racist or homophobic people is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too br br malle filmed most of it in 1979 he came back 6 years later to see what had changed this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not the up series are about people malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community and the change is great 1985 is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering once a proud community now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming br br this documentary is quite relevant today our financial crises today started because of what was happening then just take a look to these final words in the film spoken by an older lawyer from the town in 1985 br br well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession and particularly a democracy that there's good there's good a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that's going on now it's horrible br br unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened
<START> i swear when i first saw this movie i cried my eyes out a star is born is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles john norman kris kristofferson and esther streisand face you also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic when streisand sings with one more look at you watch closely now it's just pure magic this movie made the song evergreen one of my favorites and queen bee is such a fun song also i love the fashion of the '70s except streisand's afro besides that she's a beauty a star is born is my number one favorite movie this movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart breaker at the end
<START> the night of the prom the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives br br there really is no excuse for prom night there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts' it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them br br the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage and the thing was it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect either and to make matters worse the rest of the characters were equally one dimensional and oblivious the hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets nice one br br the worst thing was i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening shocking and the music don't even get me started it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral br br i really wish that prom night was a joke it was terrible and stupidly predictable no one in their right mind or otherwise has any reason to see this film mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film hear my plea don't do it there are better things to spend six pounds on like a sheet to play ghosts with
<START> for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film this film is ok as movie musicals nothing special just ok i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin first of all for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play the director producer and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer a real theatrical audition whether it be for a play or a musical rarely takes more than five minutes if you're auditioning as a dancer you get shown a 64 bar dance combination once you do it and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out michael bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little the play is about these dancers first of all director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach in the play you never see zach he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry a character who is not even in the play was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about major musical numbers were cut or rethought the opening number in the play i hope i get it shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance can you say audrey landers goodbye 12 goodbye 13 hello love a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as surprise surprise mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie the show's most famous song what i did for love which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance becomes just another standard love song in the film performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie jeffrey hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers the choreography has to be special there are a couple of good dancers in the film the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie michelle johnston as bebe and janet jones as judy but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do yet audrey landers who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time is given one of the show's best numbers dance 10 looks 3 i will admit that the finale one is dazzling but you have to wait almost two hours for that i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage this film might be worth a look but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical be afraid be very afraid
<START> that's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments meanwhile at the local bar people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter jessica debra hunter who is in love with another biker dale midkiff from pet sematary who in turn is in cohorts with the assistant back at the house the sorority bimbos swim shower change clothes and have sex with men from the bar a small silver ball part of the experiment flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling killer zombies br br if that isn't enough to entertain you there's a hilarious theme song nightmare fantasy roller skating some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet that warns danger danger just like the lost in space robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men br br this filmed in florida mess is so mind numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in and hey isn't that nypd blue's detective jill kirkendall turned cnn newscaster andrea thompson as one of oft nude bimbos sure is supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985 br br score 1 out of 10 and i mean that in a good way
<START> amongst the standard one liner type action films where acting and logic are checked at the door this movie is at the top of the class if the person in charge of casting were to have put good actors in this flick it would have been worse excepting richard dawson who actually did act well if you can call playing yourself acting i love this movie the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man okay maybe just men definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda and you better f g get used to it ahh more people have been called brenda for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine
<START> this is not just a bad film it's one of the worst films ever it's so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable the acting oh my god the script you gotta be kiddin' how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like a kid who makes fireworks in school fireworks so powerfull that when someone gets hit by it they fly a hundred yards backwards and explode a girl is trapped in the celler the killer is trying to break open the door she gets a drill but the wire isn't long enough she first makes an extension cord oh the horror and then when she's done she drills through the door and drills through the head of the killer wow and there are plenty more examples like that oh yeah and what happened to george kennedy he used to be great thunderbolt and lightfoot cool hand luke
<START> carlos saura's carmen is one of the finest achievements in world let alone spanish cinema it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer director and the principle dancers the fine line between life and art is dazzling
<START> judging by the hype and other reviews on this site i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies i wonder if there's another movie called cookers that these people reviewed there are only 3 main characters and none of them struck me as well written or well acted basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts br br do yourself a favor don't rent this movie rent cabin fever or some other decent horror movie hell rent mary poppins the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you'll find in cookers
<START> can fake scenery ruin a picture you wouldn't think so but it actually for me in here listen i have a lot of classic era movies and i know pretty much what to except such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen etc but a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes to have fake scenery fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in brigadoon gets insulting after awhile br br as far as the music entertainment went this is always subjective what songs one person likes another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film whether someone likes the songs i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs dances romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things musicals did very well in the '50s me i liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps by the '50s tap was out and this new stuff which i can stand was it does that make this a lousy movie no it just makes one i didn't care for very much br br despite the good cast good director and high expectations this film bombed at the box office and with me i should have liked it more being a dreamer myself and that's a nice part of this story i am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal then why couldn't i connect with this film part of it also was the dancing i don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen but no the thing really turned me off what that staging there was no scotland no highlands just a hokey looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start score one point for today's realism where they go on location most of the time
<START> 1 2 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall directed by richard shepard br br a well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies after 2004's after the sunset his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time professional hit man so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright kinnear possibly one of his best roles also on business there the two on screen duo produce a comically charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance one of the years most enjoyable and best films my final rating 9 10
<START> bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times it's a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something
<START> just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was 7 4 a pretty nice rate br br after 15 minutes i was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening br br i did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping up all the time on her lap top or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a don't know how to do sex in the city br br don't waste your time or money
<START> it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differences br br this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death walter's story lacks the betrayal and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent instead the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds br br my primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga but that it does such a poor job
<START> come on get over with the pakistan bashing guys bollywood can not only make brilliant movies but can seriously affect a generation of viewers br br i am a huge bollywood fan but anti pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay cinematography action sequences everything br br i'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood masala but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses
<START> in this movie chÃ¡vez supporters either venezuelan and not venezuelan just lie about a dramatic situation in our country br br they did not say that the conflict started because of chÃ¡vez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues br br they did not say anything about more than 96 tv interruptions transmitted by chÃ¡vez during only 3 days in cadena nacional a kind of confiscation o private tv signals each one with about 20 minutes of duration br br they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero inspector general of the army forces who is a traditional supporter of chÃ¡vez even now in despite of his announcement he is the ministro de interior y justicia after chÃ¡vez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa equals to defense secretary in us br br they did not say anything about chÃ¡vez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections br br they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by chÃ¡vez supporters either civilians and military official forces br br they present some facts in a wrong order in order to lie br br they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and chÃ¡vez actions in order to avoid the elections br br that's why i tell you this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie
