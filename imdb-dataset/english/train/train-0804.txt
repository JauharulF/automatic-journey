<START> as far as i can understand tiw watcher is the first work of a young director my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final credits br br nevertheless director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema what is a movie how to tell a story it doesn't matter for the novice director one of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story you learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction the development and the conclusion you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax you learn this is valid for a 3 hour epic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30 second commercial you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct it br br in rough terms tim watcher introduces us its main character and then the movie ends the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunet's amÃlie there are no second or third acts in tim watcher this is not a parody or an art film thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure you are expecting to be told a story and it doesn't happen worst than that tim watcher defines itself as a warning and one with no real purpose it doesn't make a point or at least not a valid one its point is childish with a sense of vengeance the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaean br br i was expecting a lot more from this short the movie opens with a rather good looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film i don't know the budget for this movie but judging for the thanks list in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers br br tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score that's all there's nothing else there's no plot and that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values hardly you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story br br as absurd as the comparison may sound i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over the top stylish cinematography
<START> i saw this film at its premier at sundance 09 br br since american beauty is a movie that had something to say i had hopes for towelhead unfortunately it was a disappointment in fact of countless movies i've seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals towelhead is the only sundance movie i've ever wanted to walk out early from br br the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes rather than with an organic human drama the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic if there ever was a time when towelhead's white male villains condescending portrayals of blacks ironic treatments of foreign cultures etc were fresh it's long past br br for a more detailed review please look up any of the many professional reviews available online almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on br br on the other hand the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites you'll frequently come across superlatives stunning breathtaking profound shocking it embarrasses me to read them but it does not surprise me indeed i've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial cultural gender or sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full of profound insight if you are such a person by all means rent towelhead and be moved by it on the other hand if you set your standards higher you can safely pass on this one
<START> antonio margheriti's danza macabra castle of blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts it looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe poe bets foster that he can't spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe's friend thomas blackwood accepting the wager foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood castle of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early 60's a masterpiece
<START> while a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film however compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s this is among the very best and also compares very favorably to powell's later thin man films now this does not mean that the film is that similar to the thin man movies as the kennel murder case is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery detective film now you'd think that not having nora charles or asta or a traditional comic sidekick something found in practically all series detective films along for fun would be a detriment but i didn't miss them at all because this was such an exceptionally well written film having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by all br br the film begins at the dog show and is called the kennel murder case though this philo vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super important part of the film instead a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films such as crime doctor's strangest case however how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very well keeping my interest throughout i sure wish other detective films of the day had as intelligently written plots and exceptional acting as this one this one is definitely a keeper
<START> sogo ishii has taken the old myth of musashibo benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark gory spellbinding and terrific looking movie those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be the story explains itself nicely as it goes along well worth seeking out even though there are no english language home video versions
<START> while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works this slow moving repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement br br to be sure the actors are above average considering this is an argento movie and some moments show the director's visual skills but whole sequences should've been cut and basically it's just the same exploitative trash as ever wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity br br 3 out of 10 genetic disorders
<START> corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific comedy's ever made br br while the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious 'undercover brother' his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea to bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script
<START> spencer tracy and katherine hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess who's coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters along with sidney poitier and katherine houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley kramer's 1967 master piece this present day rip off is a joke so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in rhode island brings his african american girlfriend home insert gasp here to his grand father's funeral his family members reactions were of course predictable this movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave do yourself a favor and rent the original take a pass on wake
<START> here is what happened br br 1 head of bbc3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to bbc1 and bbc2 to keep licence and job br br 2 lenny henry offers his unfunny friends up br br 3 head of bbc3 snaps them up completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny br br worst of all it is arguably racist as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes if a white person did this kind of thing there'd be uproar br br trash
<START> in the autobiographical coming of age tale romulus my father eric bana of munich fame plays an impoverished german Ã©migrÃ© struggling to raise his son raymond kodi smit mcphee in rural 1960's australia the major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife christina franka potente who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men despite her highly unconventional behavior romulus refuses to grant her a divorce masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him it is unfortunately the good hearted and good natured raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie raimond gaita would later grow up to be an author br br even though i admire romulus my father for what it is trying to do i can't honestly say i enjoyed it for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen a serious slice of life drama is one thing but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery insanity and multiple suicides let alone attempted suicides is something else again
<START> here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers how can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of south park and is directed by david zucker when i first saw this movie i did'nt immediately realise that coop and doug were really matt and trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really matt and trey later on the humor is sometimes crude sometimes foul sometimes brilliant sometimes subtle sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt under rated well actually its insane totally insane
<START> if you are hoping for anything new you have chosen the wrong movie who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's predeccesors can be good maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this thing this whole movie is like making a greatest hits dvd of the 1st 3 films but changing the actors bhhaaaad
<START> good lord what were they thinking here is your spoiler warning even though i don't think it'll really matter you won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway br br a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies in other words the whole thing is really stupid br br you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can't save something and they didn't i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang sad br br all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud it is not worth your eyes
<START> this was a great romantic comedy historically inaccurate einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb but he made a great matchmaker he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working the supporting cast lou jacobi joseph maher gene saks stephen fry etc all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around and did he wear socks in one scene reportedly the professor never wore socks two new entries for the imdb goofs section historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside this was a great movie to watch with a great cast i give it an 8
<START> this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd however the resulting movie is absolutely dire admittedly this is not the worst film ever made or the worst film this year but it came damn close br br the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be comedy adult drama thriller teen porn the story is interesting as it deals with the pitfalls of mail order brides but the film is a mess what starts out as a mildly interesting comedy a word i use in the loosest possible terms then goes totally in reverse and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller nicole kidman should know better and ben chaplin is wasted as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel whom i can only presume did this for the money br br this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect it's not funny it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty a film to be avoided unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films
<START> although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his over the top and larger than life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge br br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end as scott stands before a large window sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette augmented by scott's voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizing much like marlon brando's first scene in apocalypse now the horror indeed br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really shouldn't be it's what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies stage and screen alike br br actually i myself don't consider scott's glib rage a liability but other christmas carol purists might see the film and judge for yourselves
<START> based on one of the books by gabriel marquez and it might be brilliant literature this cinema adaption really sucks as it's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices the story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight i am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece just perhaps that you can see salma hayek in here but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that no gracias
<START> this really doesn't do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell or was it blind lemon jefferson someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great but it doesn't make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments it's a shame for wenders scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs
<START> i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in nÃ¼rnberg and it was superb i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion xylophone player influenced the mood of the film but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga br br if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied i highly recommend this film the costumes were fantastic and creative the sets were opulent and exotic and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking as is typical of silent film tragedies unfortunately i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried the story of this second film begins after siegfried's death when kremhild gudrun in the norse versions of the story begins to plan her revenge against her brothers br br also i watched this film in german i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge it was difficult to read the subtitles what do you call that in silent films at first because of the old style german script so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your k's f's and s's in the old script
<START> this picture seemed way to slanted it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd to me the subject matter seemed confused it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light as a an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v a this is a legitimate argument but felt off topic for me almost like a movie in and of itself i felt that the war tapes and blood of my brother were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint f
