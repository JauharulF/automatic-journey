<START> winchester '73 marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann as in most of them stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time br br the title refers to a one in a thousand rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july 4 1876 into town comes lin mcadam stewart and his sidekick high spade millard mitchell who are on the trail of dutch henry brown stephen mcnally for a past dastardly deed they arrive just in time to see marshal wyatt earp will geer running saloon girl lola shelley winters out of town it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with lin winning but dutch henry robs lin of the gun and escapes br br lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller charles drake hold up in a u s cavalry camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull rock hudson who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner john mcintyre he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve br br meanwhile back at the ranch lola and steve meet up with notorious gunman waco johnny dean dan duryea who kills steve and takes the valued rifle and lola for himself when dean meets up with dutch henry he allows him to take back his gun planning to murder him later in the town of tuscosa lin kills dean as dutch henry's plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit in one of the best final shoot outs ever the two meet in the final showdown br br i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewart mann collaborations that was shot in b w it is beautifully photographed especially the scenes in the wide open spaces and in particular the final showdown stewart playing against type plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann br br as in most universal westerns this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day in addition to those mentioned above j c flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant steve brodie james millican john doucette and chuck roberson as various henchmen ray teal as the sheriff pursuing duryea tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund cobb chief yowlachie and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence br br a classic western in every sense of the word it was responsible for re generating stewart's career as an action star
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re adjust her life but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence freddy trying to come out into their world again br br it's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films charles russell eraser the mask renny harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhanger die hard 2 and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator 2 but while russell and harlin made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgotten br br the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all br br the bon appetit bitch catch phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry
<START> so i'm wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from miss congeniality did ms bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before gracie hart as many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest br br the two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films as has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes br br one last peeve using the term serial killer is false advertising murdering one person even if it's a premeditated murder does not make you a serial killer you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer
<START> you're not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place they haven't done you any harm in the second place they may be radioactive ah the joys of no budget 50s sci fiÂ yet despite the odd gem like that superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58 minute running time it's beyond cheap the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation and pretty dull with it though it has a surprisingly altruistic message Â the mute mole men diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious merely misunderstood and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day perhaps but with little more than good intentions to recommend it
<START> debbie reynolds toe taps tangos and yes tap dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated '30s atmosphere two ladies brought together when their sons commit a murder try starting their lives over by running a tap dance school for tots in hollywood trouble is one of them is plagued by neuroses can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with robert aldrich directing bette davis and joan crawford nahh bette never would have allowed joan so much screen time to strut her stuff and i can't imagine bette davis in the other role tap dancing her heart out this is a purely bogus piece of macabre written by a slumming henry farrell whose idea of a good shock is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package 1 2 from
<START> what do you call a horror story without horror and story br br this is the most irritating thing about the film i get the feeling the writers never really decided what's actually going on in the film it's a different thing to know it give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it but here you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows remember cube even that film knew more about itself br br i've consumed a lot of 80's horror gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films but a lot of important things are missing we really know nothing about the characters they keep repeating empty lines over and over again the story isn't really developing it never goes anywhere b acting is ok in this type of horror films but there's not much to act in the script we don't care about the characters there's nothing to remember about them there's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex and most importantly no thrills no chills br br you only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre they show the lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story br br i honestly believe that this amount of story character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment oh yeah film makers used to do that and more some 20 years ago i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended too bad really
<START> steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to sort of in dan in real life a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart we all like steve carell this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him but you know what i liked this movie br br carell stars as dan burns a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him one weekend him and his daughters travel down to see his family while there he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman when he gets back to his house he finds out that his brother mitch played by dane cook is dating this woman played by juliette binoche br br dan in real life at times i found a bit unbelievable are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things i would highly doubt that i don't know any family who is like that is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up no br br dan in real life
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen i'm not kidding the next time it comes on i will just continually run my head into a wall it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again br br i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again they are both good comedians so i was shocked this was so awkward br br if they had to do it all over again i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it the folks that fronted the money must have lost a ton not really because the special effects all 2 of them were terrible
<START> 11 oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shoulda woulda coulda category for the judges br br its an amazing book but true to alice walker's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out br br the cinematography was amazing the african scenes live much to be desired the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia somewhere in west africa but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa and most of all why get the people to speak swahili who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the way br br but as a story amazing film making out of this world classic yes br br i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation
<START> many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early 50's is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it closes there isn't much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see there's not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast br br peter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in 1971 actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i don't think so 3 10
<START> it's one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising i have spoken before on another film in which the commercial for the comedy film makes it seem funnier than it is seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film what i and my brother who went and saw it with me didn't know is that the scene used in the tv ad was the very last scene in the film br br since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film i can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use the last scene is thanks to a youth potion dr fu manchu turns from a long bearded old man into a bright young asian elvis like rock star with back up singers no less br br set for no real reason in the 1930's peter sellers does his best with the material at hand but he's not given any really good reason for his comedic moments the rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and i sat all through this barely laughing at anything it was only natural that we were expecting a pink panther type comedy peter sellers was so great at that br br it's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died his appearance on the muppet show was more entertaining than this ill conceived flop still i don't fault him i fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this 2 stars is being generous
<START> i rented this movie because i hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy although the movie is family friendly my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of god if you obey god and follow him you are not guaranteed success your football team won't always win you won't magically get better grades infertility isn't always cured you won't always get a raise sometimes you'll be stuck with the old car br br god does not exist to meet our every whim rather we were created to glorify him sometimes we glorify him most when things seem to be going bad for us to live is christ to die is gain
<START> i remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn't have any special effects the acting was really good and it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period although now most christian music is now worship and praise music i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family i would like to have an update
<START> all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot the acting is wooden the orgy scene makes no sense etc all miss the main point br br let's be honest this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h i g h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance br br find some kind bud and smoke up or get a mild hit of acid seriously these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind br br until you've watched this movie on the big screen which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare tripping out you have no idea what this movie is all about br br if you insist on watching it not intoxicated you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd's wonderful re working of careful with that axe eugene come in number 51 your time is up
<START> i still wonder why i watched this movie admittedly before i viewed this film i knew practicly nothing about the beatles i didn't even know all their names all i knew was that they had a ton of fans they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever they broke up john married yoko ono and john was murdered br br also vh1 isn't even my favorite music station mtv is still for some reason or another i decided to watch it not expecting much surprisingly i enjoyed it very much the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up this is very important because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities and to keep you watching jared harris and adien quinn give good performaces overall br br the ending was also very smart i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl performace and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go and end it on a good note my favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene br br overall i recommend this film to almost everyone it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john's doorstep which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup
<START> after 21 movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with as mildred rogers davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howard's affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo it also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history br br at circa 85 minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of philip carey howard as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again br br howard and davis' chemistry is all but non existent davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn't care much for howard's iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as mildred all the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence then again cromwell's direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times he tries to fill in some space whenever davis is not there with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee all much in the style back then this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a simplified bare essentials translation of the somerset maugham's novel which is saying a lot since at 600 pages of human bondage would have been indeed hard to film even then br br storywise it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that mildred never hides her displeasure from the get go howard's performance never seems to go through much external emotion his eyes are constantly sad his expression never veers too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in the accidental tourist dejected hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by kay johnson and frances dee are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections interestingly johnson's norah once she realizes carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred and mildred herself is bound to miller or men who fit the role of provider in her short but memorable scene she's the one who holds the essence of the story's moral
<START> cinderella takes me back when i was a little girl i loved the princesses of disney cinderella was one of my favorites because i always was so enchanted by the story any child or family members will enjoy this wonderful and magical story br br we have cinderella who is a beautiful girl enslaved by her wicked step mother and ugly step sisters she cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks the only friends she has in the world are the mice in the attic that are so charming and musical when the ladies receive an invitation to the king's ball to find a lady for his son the prince a k a prince charming they all get excited cinderella overhears the exciting news and asks if she could come too her step mother makes a false promise and says if she does her chores and such she can come too of course she doesn't keep her promise and destroys a beautiful dress she and the mice made for the ball leaving poor cinderella behind a wonderful thing happens cinderella's fairy god mother appears and creates a beautiful dress and carriage out of things from around the house and even makes the mice and horses into elegant horses and a driver for the carriage when the prince sees cinderella at the ball he has fallen hard for her all the ladies are jealous including her step mother and sisters but cinderella must return home at midnight when the spell is broken all she leaves behind is her glass slipper the next day the prince is on a hunt to find this girl who fits the slipper and is making a stop at cinderella's house where her step mother has found out about her night and locks her in her room br br can she escape in time to tell the prince that it was her at the ball you'll just have to find out trust me this is a true disney classic with beautiful animation and classic music that is so charming you can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece a dream is a wish your heart makes this movie captures everything a girl could want br br 9 10
<START> the movie is a fantasy the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well some of the dialog is wonderfully clever the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942 br br movies are designed to serve various purposes this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count some of the closeups made me uncomfortable but he could still sing and sing magnificently however jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever she makes a spectacular angel br br this genre is well before my time and i an new to the jeanette macdonald nelson eddy films and related conversation the music in this movie is beautiful as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable more delightful better constructed the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today and jeanette macdonald without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons was more beautiful than the stars i see today i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent great beauty and great music
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the acting by the adult actors was great although i did find the main kid a little stiff but he carried himself very well for being a new talent the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk i e the nutty professor if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced i picked it up on blu ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch probably one of the better looking blu rays i've seen so far the extras were cool too they deleted quite a bit but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything
