<START> matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great the dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where lemmon's character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone i just love it and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion these two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt
<START> coming immediately on the heels of match point 2005 a fine if somewhat self repetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allen's small but die hard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda 2004 and the embarrassing anything else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoop's clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy br br even more encouraging woody's self casting sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years is here an inspired bit of self parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage patter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences if not more receptive are at least more polite like chaplin's calvero in limelight 1952 sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allen's ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time br br waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic body dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboat to hades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can't rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to waterman's magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician's climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous by play between her and allen is very amusing and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance br br scoop's serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allen's lengthy sabbatical exposure to london's ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woody's late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view we're scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering waterman's insistent borscht belt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is waterman's hilarious exit in a smart car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road br br as usual allen's humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in jokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the film's soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of grieg's the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the post funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose 1984 references to deconstructing harry 1997 include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harry's alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite 1995 br br as to quotable gags allen's scripts rely less on one liners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this put down of waterman's wannabe crime detecting if we put our heads together you'll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade
<START> i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the f word like a diabetic using equal br br no thanks br br it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate talk about it and swear at each other br br the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1 several murders occur 2 vinnie sees murder scene 3 vinnie stares moodily across atlantic east hudson river 4 vinnie cheats on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents' house more than that i didn't wait to see br br the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen br br sorry spike take some lessons from notting hill or shawshank redemption either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships
<START> i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best br br even though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture its that powerful br br a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made
<START> when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very very good and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmÃ© and the love she felt for her children actually while the new films especially episode ii are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only they make the old films seem even better br br mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job harrison ford is still good however you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit he adds more comedy obviously inspired from raiders to the character which works brilliantly in short han solo is better than ever carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very very good br br in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous two movies but this was always lucas' fortÃ© so that is really to be expected the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax br br the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery br br all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance br br 8 10
<START> oh man what was sam mraovich thinking what was anyone who was involved in this film thinking mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ben and arthur director writer producer also executive producer caster lead star you name it he did it and he mraovich sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making br br so what is wrong with this film everything the film is about two gay lovers ben jamie brett gabel and arthur mraovich groan ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people to make things worse ben's crazy ex wife they don't exactly divorce tammy julie belknap is steaming mad that ben's left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together saying that she can be gay too and arthur's christian devoted excessively hypocritical equally batty as tammy brother victor is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church br br the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ie ben and arthur fly to vermont to get married they go there on alaska airlines and vermont has palm trees they fly back on a fedex cargo plane hope they were comfy in a wooden crate plus many many more and plot holes to boot victor calls killing arthur the final plan which later changes to the final deed arthur and the private intern detective drive the same car blah blah blah the actors are all very bad and are way way over the top the script is laughably horrible one such example is i don't make sense you don't make sense i make sense that's who makes sense and there so much more wrong with the movie that i can't write them all down br br however the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ben and arthur is that sam mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic see his fake reviews for ben arthur and obvious comments by him on youtube mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is br br so to conclude forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever ben and arthur will knock them right off that title even paris hilton movies look like the dark knight compared to the monstrosity known as ben and arthur
<START> the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie we were watching it for alex winter of bill ted's fame we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about br br by the time the movie was over we knew that it was love at first sight this movie while not completely historically accurate was and is the best one of its genre i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion none of the others can compare it fibbed a little at certain details but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good but none as captivating as this one br br haunted summer has the qualities of a painting the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home the costumes were gorgeous and despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found there br br this movie shows besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well yes there were drugs it was a fairly common practice during that time a time when drugs were not illegal and the taking of laudanum the liquid form of opium was medicinal as well as recreational shelley suffered from consumption lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer and they were poets during a time when experience was the key there was no time for prudish caution passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era and out of the thoughts and discussions of science religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend frankenstein br br yes in this movie we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin not married to shelley at that time played by beautiful and talented alice krige she is the control factor to all that goes on until she too gives in to experience but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father br br the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played the music fitting the direction captured the essence of the summer as i've read about it this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne edwards if you like this movie read the book the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story br br if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time and romance and the gothic then this is a movie for you it shows the birth of the birth of the monster which even today teaches us about the morals of playing god br br a definite must see movie
<START> don't get me wrong i love action and revenge flicks i've seen many of them since i was a kid including dolph lundgren's latest the mechanik which is quite good and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films br br but with man on fire and even more then with domino scott shows that rather than using his film making genius skills intelligently he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him man of fire is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less br br the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you the audience to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it br br at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings violence and making pg 13 movies i find also suspicious that a 70 million movie is made of a b movie script with a character who cuts fingers puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isn't even dead go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence thus said
<START> this is my favorite show i think it is utterly brilliant thanks to david chase for bringing this into my life br br season 1 br br 1 the sopranos 5 5 br br 2 46 long 4 5 5 br br 3 denial anger acceptance 5 5 br br 4 meadowlands 4 5 br br 5 college br br 6 pax soprana 5 5 br br 7 down neck 4 5 5 br br 8 the legend of tennessee moltisanti 5 5 br br 9 boca 4 5 5 br br 10 a hit is a hit 3 5 5 br br 11 nobody knows anything 5 5 br br 12 isabella 5 5 br br 13 i dream of jeannie cusamano 5 5
<START> the triumph of love doesn't triumph over anything it is a plodding ponderous 4 hours of torture actually it's a little less than 2 hours long it just seemed much longer it pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as ben kingsley and fiona shaw the supporting players are not quite as awful maybe they were trying to be so over the top so as to be clownish but if so i didn't see it that way mira sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other she he 's just there my guess is the play of the same name written by marivaux some 270 or so years ago is much better it couldn't be any worse clare peploe the writer and director of this movie was inspired by a recent production of the play i don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb br br maybe it all got lost in the translation
<START> understand i'm reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasn't going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean it's easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes' but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals' and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive's wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way you'll make it through this movie
<START> this a casper the friendly ghost short from my childhood and i re watch it on youtube thank god for you tube after that i love this short and it is one of my favorite casper shorts br br i love how the short starts off spooky with frank gallop's haunting narration until we get to see casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery reading while every ghost rose from the graves to boo people casper decides to leave in search for a friend but in trying to make a friend anyone who sees casper runs away poor casper sat on a log and weep until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend br br casper and ferdie's relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when casper is not keeping a close eye on ferdie while they are playing a game of hide and seek while ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little ferdie and ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting while the hunter is firing gunshots towards ferdie casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves ferdie alone and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper casper yells to ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine but casper sees ferdie's body is not moving and asks if he is ok when casper sees ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost the only friend he ever had in his whole life casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to casper's gravestone casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself ferdie starts licking casper on his cheek casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ferdie br br overall it is a really good short though surprisingly disturbing showing death in a family oriented cartoon
<START> some funny bits but come bill a film quoting zeitgeist keep the tv show and the interviews but a film i'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film i don't know i laughed disagreed agreed this film is very confusing and inconsistent br br bill's a funny guy but also very cocky bill's rhetoric is similar to bill hicks a brilliant comedian but like many comedians the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility this might be just a personal taste but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible but the response to it cannot be sensible it will create unnecessary turmoil we can do better than just react to fundamentalism his conclusion is that we don't know and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion his humility that he only knows that he doesn't is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense br br i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist the movie in bill's film all the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources astro mystic sources that reduce everything to the stars say it all seem to be from the middle ages this film is a confusing statement from a confused agnostic agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as we don't know br br this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history br br watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but please do not behave like bill you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues
<START> where to begin this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip off of darkness falls an old disfigured woman living in the woods giving kids presents for their teeth sound familiar then it changes in darkness falls the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what why did they need the rocker his hippie girlfriend or the bubbas and their sister i think the movie would've been fine without them it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill although it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble head for a change okay to rent but i wouldn't suggest buying it
<START> this was a disappointing film the people seem to have no substance the lead protagonist martin cahil has zero redemptive values in fact everyone in it including jon voight epitomizes sleeze i would not recommend this film to anyone the violence is distasteful though artfully done the filming is to black at least the print i saw fit this category a disappointment
<START> after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all the list of problems with the film could drag on forever chief amongst them is the film is simply too long it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly br br secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade z 1970's or 1980's quality probably the worst effects of all were the horses which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved the heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence in which the thunderchild described in the book as an ironclad ram looked nothing of the sort instead it resembled a world war 1 era destroyer complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew and torpedo tubes br br the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape bathed in full sunlight and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars to detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense in some they are bathed in orange light in others green light in still others it's blue light in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue the frame rate and camera is very shaky giving everything a stuttering look br br finally the acting is overall sub par one man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were the english accents even to american ears are outrageous br br in summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one because of it's poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the imdb rankings it's a pity that mystery science theater is not still around
<START> erendira is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about the film only exists in a low quality vhs format it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release erendira is stunning and gorgeous with its magic realist images erendira is based on a short story from the novel 100 years of solitude erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house her evil grandma played by irene papas forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages the whole town gets a piece of erendira so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesn't exploit sexuality it's done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center erendira is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as they'd say in espanol es muy muy bien excellente
<START> the plot was dull the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accent someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people there were literally no redeeming features about this film br br i think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason br br i hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business they have no place in it
<START> chris and andre are two average ordinary teens misunderstood by some and picked on by others but together they stand and all will pay together they form the army of two they scheme and plan zero day that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood told through the tapes that they made zero day it is barely a fictionalized telling of the columbine tragedy br br zero day is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards the two main actors calvin robertson and andre keuck do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street their performances were very believable you kinda liked these guys and that was scary shot on video almost totally from the teen's perspectives zero day feels very real and authentic like you are right there these kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some
<START> first off i'm not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well done impressively well done at that he actually looks kind of other worldly like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a attending to nature's call spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down that or he's the caucasian brother of the wishmaster i haven't decided which br br actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and vistas say canada to me and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china it's a sci fi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location br br further apparently as we have just established sci fi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said it's a sci fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things br br the movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between alive about the donner party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman or super mario remember run faster jump higher live longer br br also the yeti has missed his teddy bear he's searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a cadaver work poor yeti you can't help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss he's missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is banished do ya hear me well it does seem to be an unmated male rebanished br br and it's superhuman well it's not human it's super yeti but then again what's normal yeti i don't know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous dahlink it's spotlessly white at times when it so shouldn't be he's fastidiously superhu super yeti br br all in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly gravel like production style this is actually quite entertaining i can't help wondering if they're planning on another one br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the m4tv scale br br it rates a 4 4 10 on the movie scale from br br the fiend
