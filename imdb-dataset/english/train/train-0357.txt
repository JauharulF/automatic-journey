<START> and the oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie br br the other reason is the comic relief of m eburne being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone hypochondriac though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication well continue giving it to her unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn yes you can use too much shadow br br my recommendation watch this once to see frye and eburne but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine
<START> stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment gerrit graham michael lerner zane busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed the dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school avoid this and seek out one of lampoon's truly funny films like national lampoon's golddiggers merk
<START> ice age is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by blue sky studios and released in 2002 as the company's first we are introduced to the main characters a squirrel named scrat voiced by chris wedge and please note the sound of scrat's screams is the sound of tom's screams from the tom and jerry cartoons a woolly mammoth named manny voiced by ray romano of everybody loves raymond a sloth named sid voiced by john leguizamo of titan a e and a saber toothed tiger named diego voiced by denis leary of pixar's a bug's life br br the movie opens with scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that he caused an avalanche we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age except for manny who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him sid comes out of his cave yawning and saw that his family abandoned him he then pays toll with some aardvarks unfortunately he gets pursued by sylvia voiced by kirsten johnston of 3rd rock from the sun a female orange sloth who wants sid to go migrating with her sid eventually teams up with manny and they became friends br br meanwhile nearby a human tribe soto voiced by goran visnjic an evil saber toothed tiger wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son roshan away from him in the morning he diego and soto's henchmen lenny voiced by alan tudyk oscar voiced by diedrich bader and zeke voiced by jack black attacked the tribe but the leader's wife escaped with roshan and gave him to manny and sid to look after eventually diego joins them and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe who are also looking for him as well relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out okay besides manny sid diego scrat sylvia and roshan the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that roshan's tribe are using and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer voiced by jane krakowski and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel voiced by lorri bagley to whom sid shows them roshan as they relax in a tar pit incidentally the two rhinos carl voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi's madagascar and frank voiced by stephen root of pixar's finding nemo who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff are simple minor characters same went for the dodos who are using melons as their food supply br br the gags in this movie are very funny for instance manny talks through his trunk saying i'm not going when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit sid asks jennifer what do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens jennifer then responds to him what do you say if you go jump into the tar pit rachel also then kicks sid in the waist sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his teeth then she asks sid if he's holding his breath tells diego to eat him and promptly walks off br br since ice age is not only a success but it has 2 sequels the first one was ice age the meltdown which was released in 2006 and the other was ice age dawn of the dinosaurs which is going to be releasing next year i can hardly die waiting to see what ice age dawn of the dinosaurs will be like
<START> others have already commented on the decline of director tobe hooper but what about brad dourif he was perfectly capable of selecting good projects as he proved by starring in the same year's exorcist iii so why did he agree to appear in this sure he gives a suitably demented performance and the film is not outright bad it's just uninvolving uninteresting and unappealing that's three un s too many 1 2
<START> this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever a british better this is spinal tap the characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events such as ray's problem with fitting in the band br br the soundtrack is excellent real period stuff even if it is in the same key you'll be humming some of the songs for days what i liked was the nearly all british cast with some of the favourite household names ray's wife is priceless br br the film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it a generator of some really good catchphrases br br it's a hidden diamond
<START> the israeli palestinian conflict persists and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries few have a clue to the other aspect of the division the group of people who want peace and work toward eradicating the separation eytan fox in the bubble 'ha buah' has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor a lot of love and a taste of brutal reality it is a window into a situation that begs for understanding br br in tel aviv three close friends are roommates lulu daniela virtzer a beautiful young woman with strong opinions yali alon friedman a very 'out' gay young man who works in a popular cafÃ© and noam ohad knoller a handsome somewhat shy fellow who in addition to his day job in a music shop is a member of the national guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city's checkpoints it is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young palestinian named ashraf yousef 'joe' sweid and a mutual attraction occurs the three friends decide to 'stowaway' the illegally present ashraf whom they nickname with an israeli name and while ashraf and noam settle into a love relationship yali hires ashraf at his cafÃ© and yali and lulu both proceed to find love interests too all goes well until ashraf must return home for his sister's wedding though in tel aviv ashraf has been able to be openly gay with noam life is far different in jerusalem ashraf is told he must marry his sister's groom to be sister in an attempt to rescue ashraf from his fate noam and lulu disguise themselves as french reporters to gain access to ashraf in a moment of supposed seclusion noam and ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom to be and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for ashraf to remain 'in the closet' br br while the young people in tel aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence an attack occurs in jerusalem one that has grave consequences not only immediately but also in the revenge mission ashraf must now assume the ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is br br the acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people the story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes eytan fox such a fine writer director more people should watch this important and very fine film in hebrew arabic and english with subtitles grady harp
<START> this is probably one of the worst wanna be a low budget hit films to credit the dinosaur genre the film is so predictable you could go away cook yourself dinner go answer the phone or whatever and when you're back you'll know exactly what has happened the special effects are so poor you would have thought lego bricks were used and the super fast dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator the acting is over cooked they try so hard yet there just isn't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses stereotypical was created for films like this if you want to watch this film i suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them don't watch it you might break the screen the facts are that far off
<START> i was pretty young when this came out in the us but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized to this day i still catch myself quoting it the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from frank sinatra to sylvester stallone to mr t the voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying the puppets were also well done although a little creepy i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf a show that i also enjoy very much like another person had written in a comment earlier i too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release but i don't think enough people have heard of it oh well maybe i'll try e bay
<START> in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed sometimes a bit of a mess br br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie poirÃ© the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren't better marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearable br br of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poirÃ© takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding br br a labored and disappointing follow up anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial br br
<START> the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work this is due to two factors stanley kubrick's masterful direction and jack nicholson's chilly acting br br nicholson plays jack torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their five year old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong he has been told by the cook dick o' hallorann scatman crothers that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them that is not jack's case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break br br the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths king criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the jack danny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the book's emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example br br another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writer's opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen king's ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson's from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal here's johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn't bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo's nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens the omen's damien and haley joel osment as cinema's great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in 1980 the scream queen clichÃ© wasn't one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy's eyes br br irvine welsh the author of trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately 5 is included in the film but in kubrick and nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form
<START> i'm not ruining anything when i inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie if that is your thing then your movie has arrived br br a woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods her sister is a creepy lady to say the least and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love on the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals br br the plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb the woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans even continues the have sex with him on the exploitative side of things there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else oh and the aforementioned goat sex scene br br most viewers won't make it to the end exploitation fans will ride it out but will be left wanting more br br 4 10
<START> better than the typical made for tv movie invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting urich lucci cassidy mccarthy pre murphy brown joe regalbuto soleil moon frye and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy maudlin denoument 7 10
<START> although written by stephen king an overrated writer if there ever was one this is actually quite entertaining b movie vampiric incestuous creatures who live in the candle lit house and drain the life force of virgins great graveyard scenery heroic cats and very pretty virgin the soundtrack even has enya's music an idea which i found quite nice i'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie although it has crappy dialogue and ideas all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler albeit sleepwalkers if i'm understood right is a script without any novel or short story behind it still those touches of sewer odors show he didn't use a ghost writer after all
<START> when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film making this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history br br the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment br br sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any director's dream at its very core br br however sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtaking br br the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning spoilers spoilers where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert towne br br in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat br br therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easy br br all in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more br br the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art
<START> popular radio storyteller gabriel no one robin williams scraggy and speaking in hushed hypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen year old boy from wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents to boot pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still since his partner jess bobby cannavale good happens to be a survivor of hiv himself br br he also acquaints himself with pete's guardian a woman named donna toni collette brilliant and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin he discovers some secrets he was naturally not prepared to find br br based on real events that happened to armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with terry anderson and directed by patrick stetner this film moves a lot faster 90 min maybe a few minutes longer than one might think a movie of this genre would run that's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear it's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew up any of the plot openings or back story i'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with mr maupin's works or his personal story you feel a little bit out of the loop here still the performances by williams i would've loved to heard more of his narration personally collette cannavale culkin and much of the supporting cast the waitress at the restaurant collete's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has are top notch and the mood established here namely the chilly lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york give a terrific framing for this story it may have ends that don't tie together particularly well but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with
<START> hong kong directors crossing over to hollywood to make movies is nothing new with the temporary exodus of the likes of tsui hark john woo ringo lam in the 90s from their collective output only a few movies or may i say just one made an impact at the box office the andrew lau and alan mak partnership has been a tour de force in recent hk cinematic history especially with their now famous infernal affairs trilogy which was remade into martin scorsese's the departed so it's no surprise when hollywood comes knocking on the door br br but without fellow collaborator mak who usually has script story duties how did lau fare with writers hans bauer and craig mitchell it's like the x files without the x in the way the story is crafted the characters and the parallels drawn with the chris carter series richard gere and claire danes pair up ala david duchovny and gillian anderson only that they don't belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms but are employees of protective services who's chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time hence they are the shepherds tending to their flock only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the propensity for violence br br the parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious that it's just a cosmetic touch up on the outside like fox mulder gere's erroll babbage is a strange lonely man consumed by his obsession in his quest to doggedly harass his flock to tote the line pained by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child just like how mulder pines for his missing sister babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan he has deep disgust for the people he's monitoring sick of their crimes and what they stand for that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal preemptive punishment at the same time he too has strong urges that he has to fight against in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he loathes as part of routine he also scans newspapers and tabloids for clues and leads toward his objective that of seeking closure salvation for himself and possessing a strong belief that the truth is still out there and he wants to believe br br danes' allison lowry on the other hand is the ingÃ©nue brought in to replace babbage but in the meantime while learning the ropes on the job for the next 18 days she is required to spy on him and to report his shenanigans pretty much like what dana scully was tasked to do with fox mulder as the disbeliever of pre emptiveness and holding onto the notion that those discharged back to society have been cured of their temptations she slowly starts to see what babbage sees and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just a desk and administrative job if she truly wants to help people br br and it is this discovery of the world of fetishes and deviant sexual practices that we open all our eyes to much like how 8mm starring nicolas cage brought snuff films into the spotlight it's a decent investigative drama with the usual red herrings and my are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your guesses are correct and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at alarming frequency though i don't credit this to a tight narrative but more from the sprawling number of characters watch out for avril lavigne's cameo and sub plots the scene in the darkened ware shophouse was akin to se7en's david mills and william somerset when they raided john doe's apartment and find plenty of bizarreness inside though here given the subject nature it wasn't lingered upon much br br apparently the flock somehow decided that enrique chediak's cinematography was good enough despite its very strange style of having no style utilizing almost every trick in the book to try and recreate feelings of watching another se7en only that this was deeply steeped in tinges of brown rather than the doom and gloom of black it does take a little while to get used to this and i put this effect as one which actually distracts from what is happening in the story not a really good move though with somewhat frequent repetition of scenes involving flashbacks br br but the flock still makes decent entertainment though x philes out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles given so much similarities in character gere and danes do put forth some chemistry as the old fogey heh and his protÃ©gÃ© and while it's not exactly great andrew lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable
<START> there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy tale like as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro's especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish br br ten stars and not a decimal less
<START> there are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that if executed clearly could have elevated it from spaghetti western blandness into something special unfortunately a town called hell is one of the worst edited movies imaginable scenes start and end abruptly characters leave for long stretches the performances and accents of the actors are pretty inconsistent etc br br robert shaw is a mexican revolutionary who after taking part in wiping out a village stays on to become a priest ten years later the village is being run by mayor telly salavas stella stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband colonel martin landau arrives looking for shaw they all yell at each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot fernando rey is in it too as a blind man the performances aren't bad but they are mightily uneven savalas has an accent sometimes as does landau who is really grating here shaw and rey prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and stevens looks pretty foxy if a bit out of place amongst the sweaty filth

<START> hotel du nord is the only carnÃ© movie from the 1936 1946 era which has dialogs not written by jacques prÃ©vert but by henri jeanson janson was much more interested in the jouvet arletty couple than in the pair of lovers annabella aumont the latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf's song les amants d'un jour except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one what's fascinating today is this popular little world the canal saint martin settings br br this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason the pimp jouvet tells his protÃ©gÃ©e raymonde he wants a change of air atmosphÃ¨re because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphÃ¨re the whore raymonde wonderful arletty thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole french cinÃ©ma br br in french atmosphÃ¨re atmosphÃ¨re est ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphÃ¨re translation attempt atmosphere atmosphere have i got an atmosphere face this is our french nobody's perfect
