<START> this movie in away was super clever it's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody br br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came br br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b ch then she's an insecure woman and so on and son on br br normally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesn't have this it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overly inspired rip off unless you hate yourself and you want to die br br 1 2 3 j leonard rollins

<START> the deceptive cover title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this movie br br it started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between 1 3 and 3 4's of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up re watching parts of the movie thinking i had missed something br br by the time i reached the last 1 5 of the movie it was all boring annoying religion thumping dialog that made no sense said nothing and was annoying to listen to i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end br br don't waste your time with this flick br br beware of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path productions br br and i'm a practicing catholic
<START> i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance br br anyway i was glad that tnn ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series i may have missed a few episodes jenny hanahan
<START> an unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two dimensional psycho thugs during a night time encounter on a forest road in shropshire england the man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers br br utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash somehow masquerading as 'thought provoking' drama whilst actually coming across as sub michael winner cr p you just know that oliver reed and susan george would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s what happens to alice gillian anderson and adam danny dyer is appalling and devastating yet dan reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness his camera lingers hungrily on anderson's naked body both during and after the assault whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional clichÃ© his script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces adams's attempted post incident assaults on both sophie and alice alice's assault on heffer after his suicide attempt confession br br the quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances dyer is a horrible actor incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault he'll end up in eastenders mark my words but anderson is extraordinary even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self indulgent arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate br br a vile and pointless film then almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance
<START> no doubt when madonna and guy ritchie married it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers if you've been through the ordeal of watching swept away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell after nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress or octress as she might have pronounced it in the next best thing she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent and that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience if there's any justice in this universe she just blew her last chance
<START> this is the only david zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind the funniest movie of 98 with night at the roxbury right behind but i did not think theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews anyway see it you wont be dissapionted

<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos i especially like the way the characters welcomed gina's various suitors with friends and family like these anyone would feel nurtured and loved i found the writing witty and natural and the actors made the material come alive
<START> this movie had mediocrity laziness and thoughtlessness written all over it if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already then you better do a damn good job i'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it some scary horror movies just fail to break the mold of the lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies clichÃ© this one sadly was no different and like all scary movies once you venture down that road there is no going back br br and the ending how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end the ending was very anti climatic and spelled part 3 which i will never watch terrible movie
<START> being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me i loved being able to see the main character diana michelle rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me michelle rodriguez did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies 10 10
<START> what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you're left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion unfortunately this is what happened to me by the end of white noise br br it wasn't michael keaton's fault it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again looking a bit wrinkled perhaps but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance as a man whose wife has recently died he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife not a new idea apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there's nothing being broadcast br br the idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called evp electronic voice phenomena and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real so i'm not going to make any comments about what i think of that or them let me just say that i'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this but what i can't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll much static indeed br br there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled but if a film fails to make itself clear for me i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker not my own unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something well for white noise i was wide awake bright eyed and bushy tailed so guess who's to blame
<START> a scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters occurring across the globe hoping to discover the source of these signals and who's behind them the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals what the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br kirk scott as andrew boran is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer he suspects a series of large earth disruptions may be connected to the weird space static mr scott and pretty blonde wife sue lyon as sylvia boran investigate the mysterious signals from outer space they discover priestly but creepy christopher lee as father pergado and other silliness given that end of the world is remarkably dull br br end of the world 1977 john hayes kirk scott sue lyon christopher lee
<START> where to start oh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesn't work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home
<START> i would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as i am not a professional film critic and i do not have enough knowledge of making movies what i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and i would like to congratulate the director for that however in some reviews that i have read critics have complained that hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely erased from the story now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests it is not a movie about hiralal's brothers it is a movie on the relationship of mahatma gandhi and his son hiralal gandhi nothing more nothing less if we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture no matter how relevant they were in real life so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves br br enjoy
<START> i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful whomever the actor was that played jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didn't expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings don't waste your time or money on this film like i did you will be sorely disappointed
<START> i am a huge fan of warrior movies some of my favorites are braveheart troy the last samurai and gladiator and after watching mongol which is absolutely awesome and which i strongly recommend i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie but it was terrible awful even pathetic is not a strong word in this case the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen but it didn't then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end but even that was a huge disappointment just some random running around waving with the swords there are so many good warrior movies this one is not one of them
<START> john hughes' son wrote a high school drama wow i thought as i checked the flick's info here on imdb late on a saturday night having found myself watching the opening credits on bbc2 br br i've just finished watching it and sadly it was downhill from there on arguably you can't spoil a film this poor but i'll leave the spoilers out of this review br br there's an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release as for the substance the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life but beneath the shiny veneer a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise characters are painted in childishly broad strokes falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in breakfast club br br director kyle cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information which soon becomes a tiresome device but at least pushes the story along but his efforts don't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting how anyone is supposed to side with 'maddox' when blake shields gurns and glowers his way through the part i just can't understand not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes i'm all for creative license but when the bad guys know the identities of the good guys making their lives a misery but fail to act in any way to stop them you really have to wonder why this script didn't undergo another few re drafts before production did daddy even read it br br i'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film and all power to them but they're really better off sticking with hughes sr 's high school output and if the idea of school time rebellion is what really appeals the 1968 classic if is a much more satisfying examination of the subject
<START> this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions including the once upon a time in china series the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work i only saw the wires in two shots aside from the action the story itself was strong and not just used as filler to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint
<START> when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also don't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece it's absolutely perfect as it is br br when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece it's absolutely perfect as it is 10000000000000 10000000000000
