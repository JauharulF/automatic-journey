<START> possible spoilers br br the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo and when your title character fails your movie usually isn't far behind it the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror for instance and the tree form was actually very good however as a monster character it never really comes to life we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior and what we do see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself or any wendigo lore i've ever read br br i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do in the movie when you boil this film down to its bones what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster br br the cinematography is good though a little cheesy the filmmakers use scenery lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable making him the real monster in the film it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend br br i have heard unconfirmed reports from a newsgroup that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that when the monster suit was built it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves the performer had to walk on his toes that it was nearly impossible to run walk or otherwise perform in it thus the many flashes of the creature standing still and the obvious sped up footage of it running i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed
<START> this movie is all ultra lightweight fluff predictable from beginning to end as a don knotts vehicle the incredible mr limpet was much better with knott's character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant his performance there was toned down with none of his trademark goggle eyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile much as bob denver did neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast it was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the high pitched voice john ritter whom knotts worked with in three's company was able to transcend his genre branching out successfully into dramatic roles like the dreamer of oz but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in pleasantville even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in airplane and police squad br br there's also no way the then 43 year old knotts could pass for a 35 year old as his character insisted he was it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at 38 playing the college age forrest gump br br the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget very much looking like a hastily filmed tv episode it's especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where roy goes after he's fired it's unlikely even a pre schooler would be fooled by the mayberry like soundstage artificiality br br even viewing this strictly as a children's movie it's very disappointing it's not because it lacks action or special effects although it does the pace is much too slow the situations repetitive how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap with breakneck gags otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well movies even kid's movies have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written disney's the love bug for instance at least had some interesting race action
<START> yes i loved this movie when i was a kid when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out br br my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system at first my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it br br like i said this movie is every little boys dreamÂ the movie contains a terrific setting big muscled barbarians beautiful topless women big bad monsters and jokes you'll only get when you get older so a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time at first i was bored then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid and continued watching yeah the experience wasn't as great as i rememberedÂ the acting is pretty bad the storyline is pretty bad the jokes weren't funny anymore but the women were still pretty yes i've grown up even though the movie experience has changed for me i still think it's worth 7 stars for the good old times you knowÂ
<START> well here i go with another b industry movie it's sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isn't in question in this one surprise but plot is how can a tight knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was give me a break
<START> i am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film br br often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming absence of action as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytelling br br i enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of clichÃ© in the foreign film arena i enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow br br that said this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time i wasted watching it no meaningful character development no engaging story arc no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen br br synopsis a bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the house boy finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her br br while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario i was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it and i wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings br br unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest steering clear of this one
<START> japanese tomo akiyama's keko mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i haven't seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of re releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizard whatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed well the main thing about the film is its name keko mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say keko mask unknown while the actor names are listed br br the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like i've never seen such a beautiful vagina and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantastic br br there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors optically fog blur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc there's one great scene in which one nerd sees girl's bare you know what for the first time and says hey there's no fog in it i couldn't help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel i'm glad it allowed as i've heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etc br br this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don't mention here and it wouldn't be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think you'll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 8 10 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal
<START> i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented melissa joan hart is we are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the sabrina fans that mjh shines in a drama seen as we have watched her on sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves one thing that all sabrina viewers will notice melissa works with david lascher in this well before he took the role of josh on sabrina so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again hopefully mjh gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies sort of like kellie martin who has always shined in tv movies lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to melissa joan hart you shine always melissa
<START> excellent p o w adventure adapted by eric williams from his own book a paperback copy of which forms part of my father's library that was inspired by true events it may well be the first film of its kind and therefore has a lot to answer for Â not just similarly stiff upper lipped examples such as albert r n 1953 which i'll be watching presently the colditz story 1955 and danger within 1959 but higher profile releases from the other side of the atlantic namely stalag 17 1953 and the great escape 1963 this then sets the basis pretty solidly british soldiers interned in a german camp devise an ingenious plan of escape borrowing a page from greek legend Â burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors actually the film is neatly split into two halves the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel culminating in the escape itself while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral sweden typically of these british films the cast showcases several established leo genn current anthony steel and up and coming peter finch david tomlinson and bill travers stars to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors anthony dawson bryan forbes michael goodliffe and walter gotell the three leads escapees are genn steel and tomlinson while the first two stick together the latter goes his own way Â only to run into the others on reaching safety as can be expected the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement as with most male centered p o w sagas too female interest is kept to the barest minimum director lee didn't have a lengthy career Â with this and the somewhat similar albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint a town like alice 1956 his most noteworthy achievements Â but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case even if reportedly delays in filming saw lee quitting his post prematurelyÂleaving producer ian dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends anyway worth special mention is the exquisite lighting particularly during night time sequences throughout
<START> until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon jane austen's emma then two came along in the same year 1996 or if you count 1995's clueless which updates austen's plot to a modern american high school three in two years br br the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from a well to do family in regency england she is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications br br today in 2008 kate beckinsale is a hollywood star but in 1996 despite being only a year younger was not nearly as well known internationally as gwyneth paltrow she is however just as convincing as austen's well intentioned but often wrong headed heroine beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful hero in kenneth branagh's version of much ado about nothing and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in turkeys like pearl harbor or underworld br br i preferred jeremy northam to mark strong as emma's love interest mr knightley largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a gentlemanly chivalrous older man in some ways more of a father figure to emma than a lover his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenth century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry strong tends to downplay the question of the age difference he is 37 she 21 and makes knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does northam samantha morton another actress who would go on to bigger things is perhaps closer to the harriet of the novel than was toni collette br br this was the more small scale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast costume drama however is generally something that british television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and well made versions of austen's novel 7 10
<START> it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles i think itÂ´s one of the best horrormovies ever it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy i must admit i wasnÂ´t able to laugh about when i saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact that he doesnÂ´t know who he really is his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie of course itÂ´s all in his mind but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in i think thatÂ´s an interesting question his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and itÂ´s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his her window but this terrible cry does that mean that all will repeat again and again and again that his soul is in a cage or something and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff the fact that he she looks like a mummy in the hospital thatÂ´s not an incident but a clue in my point of view
<START> this was a very daring film for it's day it could even be described as soft core porn for the silent era it was a talkie but dialog was extremely limited and in german one did not need it anyway br br the young 19 hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive stereotype german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated returns home to her father br br in a famous and funny scene she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it as she left her clothing on the horse an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing after getting an eyeful br br they sit for a while and in a zen moment he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect she knows this man is different br br she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow and finds the ecstasy she was denied you can use your imagine here but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure since he never got undressed you can imagine certainly an homage to women by the director gustav machatÃ½ and a shock to 1933 audiences br br the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt and a strange ending
<START> i give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa the rest was well pretty boring for about 50min we have the outline of the plot in war of the worlds the introductory part lasted oh about 10min then was real action this is something like let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets and maybe deliver a message like don't kill elephants very ecological i would have expected this out of a new steven segal movie not from this the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun tan dyed hair and too much foundation and i didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up or she sweats or her clothes are dusty she just doesn't look like a 19 century woman and in the bar where they seek up our hero swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula hmmm bram stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and it became famous in the next years livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from 1840 to 1880 so unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 houston we have a problem swayze makes a nice impression as a nutshell hard on the outside but soft and cuddly on the inside not that i would cuddle with a nut but you get the point he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions the movie stank way too long and increasingly boring don't watch it don't buy it it's a waste of your money
<START> this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film and it does not let up for a second br br it's tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy but it is oh so much more than that fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the funniest offerings to come out of hollywood in years past basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves see this movie if you love to act immature a classic
<START> i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d'or at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible
<START> barbra streisand's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history in any media cleverly divided into three separate acts to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks streisand made the bold yet masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone the risky move paid off enormously as my name is barbra set a new standard for musical programming on television br br filmed in glorious black and white which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show my name is barbra is flawlessly conceived and impressively shot however what makes the show truly transcendent is streisand herself watching the then 23 year old performer navigate herself through the show's 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling she is in fantastic voice and even performs the entire first and third acts live and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen br br the special's biggest asset is it's boldness in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs after the powerful opening performance of much more with a brief opening snippet from leonard bernstein's my name is barbara barbra proceeds to wander through a multi level studio set performing a frantic version of the disney classic i'm late in between verses of i'm late streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting make believe and the thundering how does the wine taste halfway through the act i barbra re enters her own childhood to the strains of a kid again and then gives highly energetic performances of i'm five and sweet zoo while romping among an over sized set the illusion is eventually shattered however as streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world she then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely where is the wonder streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of people before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience br br act ii of the special begins with streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of i've got the blues before delivering a comedy monologue about pearl from istanbul streisand then heads off to bergdorf goodman's department store which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store's elegant fashions this segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics some high points of the act ii medley include streisand singing a restrained version of second hand rose to the audience appearing as a latin bullfighter to the tune of nobody knows you when you're down and out and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to brother can you spare a dime the third act of the special is a straight concert with no set pieces or concepts streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special streisand enters belting out an almost gravity defying rendition of when the sun comes out and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of the yearling ballad why did i choose you a scorching performance of lover come back to me and an impassioned medley of three songs form funny girl streisand really outdoes herself however with a phenomenal rendition of the fanny brice billie holiday standard my man which instantly became on of the singer's best loved signature songs br br streisand performs her immortal ballad version of happy days are here again as the closing credits roll by on the left hand side of the screen the iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special my name is barbra was a huge rating triumph when first aired and it eventually picked up five emmy awards in addition to spawning two top five gold selling soundtrack albums watching it all again it's absolutely no surprise
<START> this 1997 film blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love the pervasive ongoing and progressive magnetism between judge reinhold and what's her name is sure to set many a viewer's heart a flutter with memories of one's own first crush the brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair to be in front of the enraptured audience sitting transfixed as the abstract almost expressionist cinematography deep focuses on the just under the surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals you can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron br br a tiny drop of perspiration on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine and leaves no doubt as to its significance scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again as with jane eyre and rebecca to which this masterpiece is so often compared the closeups of the actors' faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love that is not to be will haunt you forever br br the now classic rc soundtrack score with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer emphasizes the emotion that drips throughout like a leaky crankcase br br if i had any criticisms at all by mentioning what i consider a minor flaw and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts i would say that the hallmark of runaway car its sense of mounting sexual tension is briefly broken by the highway scene which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong and probably even unnecessary to the eternal bittersweet tale of love interrupted br br dare i advance what i perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema 'citizen kane' had its 'rosebud' 'runaway car' should have its catchword as well perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of judge reinhold saying something such as a car is an extension of its owner and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to parsing every syllable subtlety and nuance of that phrase had that plot line been done this film could have topped titanic at the golden globes that year i'm convinced br br my one regret that i didn't read the novel first
<START> spoilers herein br br my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than australian kickboxing's favorite son stan the man longinidis the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia's greatest kick boxer he said that he wasn't a sell out he was happy and a retiree he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxingÂ then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called trojan warrior this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight for now br br stan plays ajax a kick boxing ex special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne ajax's cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didn't stray too far away from everything to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party it's all pretty ridiculous but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again br br i'll admit i was actually pumped to see this i love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect stan's actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities remember those plot holes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now that's a marriage br br amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as Âa cross between jackie chan guy ritchieÂ has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doingÂ well anything and guy ritchie is the crime film messiah and you're comparing him to salik silverstein this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja br br now where do you thing the whole trojan warrior title comes from ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the gangsters' unification to find theo like that of the trojan empire no it's becauseÂ wait for itÂ theo carries a condom around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket he is a trojan warrior br br i had the displeasure of seeing trojan warrior on dvd as well as it's special features br br Â video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark chopper read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together br br Â bloopers there was no real difference between these and the actual film br br Â stan the man longinidis kickboxing featurette this wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage br br i don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of trojan warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad
<START> this movie was on t v the other day and i didn't enjoy it at all the first george of the jungle was a good comedy but the sequel completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all they should of had the original actor brendon fraiser and original actress i forgot her name so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought it was good to see ape the ape back but wasn't as fun as the first they should of had the new george as georges son grown up and still had bredon and whats her face in the film that would've been a bit better then it was
<START> there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the business br br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you don't notice king vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving thalberg br br it's about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs br br please even if you're not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can it's really a terrific trip back in time
<START> this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values the movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie besides this it is flawless
