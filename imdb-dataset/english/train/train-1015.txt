<START> greetings again from the darkness 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment br br the idea is 18 love relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city of course some stand up better than others and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotion some very known directors are involved including the coen brothers wes craven alfonso cuaron alexander payne gus van sant and gurinda chadha many familiar faces make appearances as well steve buscemi barbet schroeder catalina sandino moreno ben gazzara gena rowlands gerard depardieu juliette binoche willem dafoe nick nolte maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins br br one of the best segments involves a mime and then another mime and the nerdy yet happy young son of the two mimes also playing key roles are a red trench coat cancer divorce sexual fantasy the death of a child and many other topics don't miss alexander payne director of sideways as oscar wilde br br the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch but as a film it cannot be termed great still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer
<START> having searched for this movie high and low i actually found it when i least expected playing on the sundance channel very early in the morning one day why i searched endlessly for a small vanity project that chuck barris that was made during the last waning years of the tv show i haven't a clue the film is simply put horrible the scripted part that deals with a week that is of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were too hot for tv or rejected for some reason or other that part is still horrid but campy bad which was enjoyable in it's own way now that i saw what i sought after for so long will i watch it again in my lifetime resoundingly no do yourself a favor and just watch the much much better confessions of a dangerous mind or find old copies of the actual show the girl act where there just lick popsicles provocatively was fun but having to endure seeing jay p morgon flash the audience has in all likelihood made me sterile in hindsight i'm so very happy that this was massive flop for if it was a massive hit there could have been a the 1 98 beauty show movie and that my friends would surely have brought upon the apocalypse br br my grade d
<START> i have to admit when i went to see this movie i didn't really have high expectations but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed br br basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends there's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that's pretty much it for that character which i don't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie br br so while on a subway rainn wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl uma thurman this is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of hot br br rainn wilson's performance is also far from hot normally i'm all for his acting but even he couldn't salvage this movie his character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate it was almost painful br br but anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero or g girl as they like to call her in the movie it still baffles me as to what the g stands for but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate br br the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurman's passion let's say it makes my head hurt but not in the i'm thinking really hard to understand this way br br when uma insults anna faris calling her a whore i had no debate with that apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly she can't act and relies souly on the fact that she's blonde and typical br br overall i would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid 8 75 to see it the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially uma thurman someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting br br also the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers overall if you value your money and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie
<START> perhaps because i was so young innocent and brainwashed when i saw it this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me i haven't seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now however i will say that it left an impression on me and most of my friends it did serve its purpose at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions i was particularly terrified of what the newly converted post rapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast i don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes but i can still picture them in my head and it's been 19 years
<START> there was a great film to be made about steve biko sadly this wasn't it denzel washington never the most flexible of actors is totally unable to convey the great charisma that biko had attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable the soweto massacre wasn't like this three neat lines of children some doing cartwheels marching happily into the guns of the soldiers with biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family i'm sure donald woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that biko was important while he wasn't penelope wilton's accent is pure hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in south africa at all at all the wood's family dog gets more lines than the black maid as the family make their escape one the women i saw the film with incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large full cinema whispered this is like the sound of music she had a point br br overall this is a film by a well intentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people's struggle and really south africa needs well intentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head
<START> bo derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years Â and that's how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director he's virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema Â not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only 16 when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set Â but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious br br the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo's family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover they're attracted to one another but as i said don't expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness Â hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea side resort and keeps expecting a cruise liner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale derek's is even nuttier Â she craves possession of a large antique bath tub for the record the couple are married by the end of the film br br also involved in the non events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open air movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy 1931 at the end of the day while bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
<START> this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off br br theonly reason why i didn't turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie br br this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadn't been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mind br br i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didn't even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed
<START> unlike other commenters who have commented on this movie's ability to transcend race contrarily i think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof washington directs fisher's story with a careful hand and critical eye relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of women's bodies perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze i think this film might be a bit too happy in the end however it is deeply entrenched in afro american culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this afro american antwone fisher i have problems with the naval aspect of the film but when we look at america there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are were in fisher's situation or similar situations viewers may go to this movie expecting a black movie what is a black movie br br do stereotypes of pimps whores drug dealers single parent homes and so forth constitute a black movie i think washington as director recognized that afro americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few these problems have historically and presently only been given light and validity via good will hunting and other white movies it's high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media br br sad to say though in this racist country denzel washington and derek luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an oscar or anything else they both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an oscar that is to say denzel deserved awards for malcolm x hurricane and others before that jive training day oscar that is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work yet hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as american beauty midnight in the garden of good and evil american pie and even gone with the wind br br derek luke is a helluva actor and i wish him best all of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down although i do take issue with denzel's selection of yet another straight haired light skinned sistuh that said everyone should watch this film however it may not be for everyone much luv 10 10
<START> i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as i am you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early and embarrassing footage it's as if the producers of laugh in sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points and more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a 10 000 budget to complete it hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over idealism and the uptightness of the establishment clearly not for everyone
<START> this is one of quite a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian and a space dog called k 9 is included as well this looney tunes episode is very funny has reasonably good cartoon animation marvin's animation is very well done and the plot is well done the end is rather weird so be prepared for it it is slightly boring br br in this episode marvin the martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mars with his trusty dog k 9 marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but bugs bunny he greets them with treats thinking they are trick or treaters in their costumes little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars br br i recommend this episode to anyone who likes bugs bunny marvin the martian and looney tunes in general as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned you are likely to like this enjoy hasty hare
<START> 1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members br br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list which is arguably not as good and i'm half polish br br don't get me wrong schindler was a classic and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i'm not a big cryer br br maybe it was the music superb or the cinematography sumptuous but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who i'd never heard of before and of course oprah br br the rest is history but at the time who knew
<START> this movie was terrible the plot sucked the acting was bad the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out i wish i had the time i spent watching this movie back the balloon scene was stupid the mormon jokes are really old the soundtrack sucked i saw no chemistry between the two leads it's full of stereotypes stupid local celeb cameo's most noted was del i'm going to drive as fast as i want to computer idiot what is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up this movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream lds beliefs into hollywood i e the rm church ball etc etc i would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall you will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show
<START> there can be no questions of spoilers for this movie the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways br br a blatant rip off of stuff like critters and gremlins this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films it ends up a sleazy waste of time where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them they wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening it's painful to watch and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast br br basically some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds the guards new recruit the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the grem hobgoblins br br all life is here with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock his 80's slut girlfriend the 'hero's frigid and prissy girlfriend and the young hero lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway br br first off comes the infamous rake fighting scene where the ex military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours then there's some running around terminating in a real pie fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them then the film sorta ends and alls well that ends well br br it's not this is like watching a train wreck you cant take your eyes off it it's so bad perfect fare for mystery science theater but god awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut the fashion police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast and i dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight this scores 2 out of 10 at most on a good day
<START> i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and low key but deeply heartfelt henry thomas' he played the child in e t performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that we're talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesn't act or have lines but rather just is is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas' mysterious relationship w e t was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good baby br br then there is the music ah what music gillian welch's tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country music br br this film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly
<START> this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable worth watching just for the music alone although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective it's over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon i'm disabled and if i were as hyper sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away sometimes you need to lighten up put your head back and float caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion sigh
<START> not as bad as some are making it out to be though obviously pathetic compared to the original in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect other than some mediocre action scenes however the rest of the film is flawed character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless with many loopholes and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open as for prashant raj seriously who is this guy where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene whether it be action comedy or even a scene when someone has just died ajay devgan was average at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion overall rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance
<START> this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world i'm pretty sure it was double team which convinced everyone that jean claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever while universal soldier the return isn't as dull as double team or the quest it's still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling as i look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud in other words another clunker in van damme's assembly line br br out of 4 bad
<START> this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i've ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys br br that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best br br 10 10
<START> the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weak implausible story line miscasting and general lack of content substance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didn't know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br movie's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i don't recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast
<START> spoilers in this br br rosenstraÃe is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichÃ©s and not enough good acting br br the storytelling storyline is bad like in james cameronÂ´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now weÂ´ve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling how can riemann know about the fate of the little girlÂ´s mother and her interrogation for example br br the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twenties br br riemannÂ´s character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes clichÃ© after clichÃ© is piling up and this is why the movie does not work br br basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end itÂ´s all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and ta da everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true event br br it is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connor br br
