<START> welcome to collinwood is one of the most delightful films i have ever seen a superb ensemble cast tight editing and wonderful direction a caper movie that doesn't get bogged down in the standard tricks br br not much can be said about this film without spoiling it the tag line says it all 5 guys 1 safe no brains br br william h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast george clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem br br
<START> the message of this movie is personality is more important than beauty jeanine garofalo is supposed to be the ugly duckling but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly actually she's a lot more attractive than uma thurman the friend who looks like a model br br now would this movie work if the ugly duckling was really unattractive when will hollywood stop with this hypocrisy br br in my opinion despite the message that it wants to convey this movie is simply ridiculous br br
<START> couldn't believe it clipped sentences good grief know what all true real people ever talk like this don't think so good girl stout fellow stiffen upper lip only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights seemed endless anyway think all franchot tone's dialogue dubbed when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish handy tip we brits clip words not sentences and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time but that's only if we've been to a really good public that's private to you school
<START> this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt snafu br br all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and that's what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that's still being done today br br we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven't learned this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing br br the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever br br nothing hilarious here but it wasn't meant to be you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time
<START> i'd heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a transvestite and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he's better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the 'englebert is dead no he's not' routine the audience doesn't know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england 'cake or death ' is priceless my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you won't be disappointed
<START> why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles an unexpected love ooh how provocative this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion you might enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people why am i wasting my time writing about it
<START> i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind teasing message should look like definitely the broken is not one of those movies i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless so you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed but though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments furthermore if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages they're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest i guess horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of for instance the horror movie train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them br br and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex tv safety being pampered etc can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons believe it or not entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems death
<START> this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses from the time they walk in to the time hardy just falls off the roof this keeps me laughing hysterically i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short i also recommend all of the ghost series if you are looking for laughs see this movie and you will be happy
<START> what is with all of the european especially england comments here all i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great of course it's stupid that's the point you have to see the movie dr strangelove and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie but come on people what did you expect to see i can think of many movies that are far worse than this and they were expensive hollwood films with real actors in them for what it's worth men in white is a very stupid funny mock of a movie and with all the stupid funny stuff that england has been making for the last half century i am shocked at all the negative comments us stupid americans like our stupid humor p s see 'team america world police for some true laughs that europeans will especially like ha
<START> i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel you'll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasn't there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anything br br is it the redneck is it the wendigo no it's a cameraman on speed that's not scary it doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience br br terrible film
<START> the plot kurt harris jeff wincott a bitter ex cop goes undercover in the peacemakers after his friend is killed by their leader while there he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor and will do anything to achieve this goal even murder the cast is good jeff wincott is a good martial artist and good actor brigitte nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays matthias hues also him good martial artist the direction is good the fight scenes also the rest is ok with tony burton who plays a friend of kurt killed from nilsen and cyndi pass plays a bad girl from producers of another action martial arts film bounty tracker with lorenzo lamas a good action film the best film of martial law series
<START> drum scene is wild cook jr is unsung hero of this and many movies fantastic actor great flick a few twists that keep you moving a must see
<START> rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings actors of stature robert duvall robert downey jr are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee stained camera lens a writer john grisham who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of under motivated incoherence the film has a cheap lecherous feel about it but barely at the level of commentary its really part of the aesthetic normally i come on to the imdb to write balanced generally appreciative comments this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless bilious rant i won't but only because i no longer want to occupy my mind with this trash
<START> outrage is pretty good movie robert culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things it isn't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one
<START> good film tells a boyish fantasy story telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation also it's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self do we have to listen to the nrj shouting see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee
<START> i had some reservations about this movie i figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about christmas being in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snow br br this movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james gandofini he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dad br br if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
<START> this budget starved italian action sci fi hybrid features david warbeck as a miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of atlantis to stop an evil businessman academy award nominee john ireland from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world you got all that despite such a loopy plot this is actually quite a bore and the raiders of atlantis sneers at it with contempt honestly the most intentionally creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of herbie hancock's beverly hills cop theme for the opening titles the most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back to back perhaps director alberto de martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career i was going to declare this ireland's worst film on his resume but then i saw satan's cheerleaders was listed on there i would also like to safely declare that i am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and hitchcock's vertigo
<START> what network was diagnosis murder on i thought it was cbs am i right or also back in those days the actual production h q was near about the van nuys airport i surely remember because i practically made nearly two episodes in those daze more i remember the early days i had found an article in reader's digest giving this actor writer a clue to a terrific episode so just for suggesting it i was awarded awarded or not i sadly didn't develop it and was cut out of it all due to poor publicity of mine so as a justification i learned as i always have the hard way roll the dice craps just a side bar on mr van dyke he had a house in the brentwood area on chalon road and it was an incredible party house dick had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house
<START> unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend pretty young girls in peril i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road trip shots you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production watching unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm up some of the most awkward badly lit overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose i wondered why they didn't just put the cue cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their gaze the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t a factor rather than talent laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever long pauses weird expressions emphasis on the wrong word it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films the scenes shift suddenly with long black outs you could drive a mack truck through cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer but ya know it grew on me i felt sorry for it i wanted to hug it kiss it's boo boos and make it better the ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but i grinned anyway i have my own theories regarding the whole banned hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor otherwise pass
<START> watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year it wasn't at all a bad movie certainly not average but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one dimensional which perhaps as based on frank miller's comic book was the right decision to go with but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword led combat with the occasional freaky creature or super hot female to go with the painterly surroundings while i would probably re watch fire and ice before 300 again they both aroused that similar feeling the exception this time being naturally that it's frank frazetta the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics collaborating with director ralph bakshi in what isn't typical hollywood fare but something for the die hard fans br br what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day is the possible cons mentioned before and maybe that you will see something somewhat unique fire and ice isn't even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature but it's possibly the most fluid if not quite my personal favorite of the few he made and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre historic part out of this world fantastic and part medieval and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds the skies and grounds there's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design bakshi went as far as to say it's more frazetta than him this may be true but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion my favorite was the momentary skeleton guide how they rotoscoped that amazes me br br i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it if you're already a die hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada so suffice to say it's about well fire against ice with characters named nekron and darkwolf the coolest male of the lot and most comic book in appearance and teegra the typical hottie who's almost too perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure what the plot does do as an asset is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes and per usual for bakshi he conjures up some craziness if not quite his usual inspired lunacy in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material if you've seen wizards you'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent br br so if you're an animation buff seek this out right away for some 'old school' i e 1980s action and incredible design for everyone else it's good not great as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension with some alterations 300
