<START> this utterly dull senseless pointless spiritless and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post trainspotting movies the beach already took care of that what this low budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self delusion bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once promising director's quick demise br br the premise is absurd two losers ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g a rapper likely meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit making duo which they become a friend of theirs an even bigger illiterate loser becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage now i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous the music makes oasis seem like the beatles during the studio recordings the duo strumpet change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti social these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots it's just too dumb it's plain awful br br the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this rags to bitches story has no point and makes no sense it often feels improvised under the influence of drugs danny boyle is a complete idiot this little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch ecclestone's i q also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense whoever financed this Â£1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners
<START> oh my god the worst sh t i've ever seen this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable i especially mean the role of h graham what was that in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers the character was played in affected and annoying way every time she appears it reminds that you' re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion terrible don't waste your time
<START> if you like sci fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie br br the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for it br br i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv br br if you like non stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore you have to see this movie
<START> i enjoyed this film very much tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all i did not know what to expect from jewel's performance but i think she did rather well lots of exciting scenes a thoroughly good ride i am absolutely a fan of maguire's check out cider house rules one of the all time best ever
<START> many people thought that this is a good movie but i don't agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i can't see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the sound br br after a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly br br in conclusion i don't think this is a good movie
<START> hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentary like approach to the material however the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes Â some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained Â the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general it is a thought provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole br br a fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife's clothes a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy racer boyfriend a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave br br the despair in the film is palpable many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on screen events leave you reeling in particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all off screen for some vandalism she didn't even do arouses a sour almost angry taste in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come uppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film every moment of light heartedness is counter balanced with a moment of coldness every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair for every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate we might want to turn away from hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded
<START> this incredibly overrated anime television series 26 episodes 25 minutes each is about a 14 year old boy and two of his girl classmates who pilots a giant robot to defend japan against invading beings called angels there is very little explanation given to the angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans you're attempting to destroy the robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs br br some might be intrigued by fans who mention the very few symbolic references herein but that's all they are shallow one liners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship as a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters who are really nothing more than self pitying crybabies the psychology is pathetic with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like i hate my father repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value it's no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from time wasting mediocrity to anger inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless angst ridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble some of which is totally meaningless br br i'm not kidding when i say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed every day i'd look at the dvd set sitting on my living room table and say to myself damn i've gotta watch the next episode at some point sigh i may as well slug through another one tonight the real kicker was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long yet they were somehow able to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening 10 minutes this is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150 minute films with glacial pacing so my criticism of this series is most damning indeed br br never in my entire life have i despised watching a series as much as evangelion i had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on imdb and i certainly wasn't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard earned money what followed was 10 hours of pure unmitigated torture my love hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster br br evangelion represents everything anime should not be massive quantities of dull pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema the universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as one of mankind's greatest achievements is probably the most stupifying comment i've ever heard on imdb and i've seen some doozies
<START> kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals a journey on the darkest road ever the road of no return the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california the man david duchovny in his best role up to now wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl who is a photographer is going to take the pictures so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad but the couple that answers it is not just any couple it is one of the strangest couples ever the girl is a naive frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses the man is exactly the opposite a cruel ruthless murderer we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia not with c as usual but with k presumably symbolizing the word killer along his journey of betrayal murder and finally defeat all the leads duchovny pitt lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star the photography is amazing with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie and the music suits the dark character of the film on the whole this is a really good movie don't miss it you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with
<START> the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2 parter during the 3 year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot the cage the move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time one positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history though they still used terms such as 'united space fleet' in these early episodes br br the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans astonishingly though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock's vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain pike now horribly crippled well spock is half human we tend to forget or has he simply gone mad it may very well be for he's directing enterprise to talos iv a planet so off limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet's books when the jig is up there's a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy as uhura looks on in shock even kirk usually steady as a captain should be doesn't know what to make of his first officer's illogical conduct br br in the 3rd and final acts we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior when capt pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers we really don't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2 parter we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part not only is spock facing severe penalties but it looks like kirk's career may be finished as well double jeopardy folks this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts none were available in the earlier the enemy within when the crafts were really needed there's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase this was the only way to visualize such things back then finally check out kirk's smug approach at the start of the episode boy do things go sideways on him as the story progresses
<START> all the world's a stage and its people actors in it or something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit or even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itself br br this film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story br br alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
<START> another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all it doesn't deserve the name american pie they should have stopped at the wedding br br this movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series it doesn't fell like american pie at all it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie movies br br i don't recommend it ever actually i don't recommend any of the american pie presents movies just stick with the nice original trilogy br br 2 10
<START> warning spoilers ahead br br spoilers br br i've seen movie in german so it might be that i missed some clues br br despite some weakness in the plot it's a movie that came through to me i liked especially lexa doig's acting sometimes i got impression that she is camille but i can't stop wondering what happened at the end with bob cassie and baby i belive she after initially being set on bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him otherwise it's a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it it's up to viewer to decide and i don't like such endings dean cain was as good as ever eric roberts well i've seen him better but also worse br br i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story br br bottom line is i liked it very much
<START> the secretary is one of those cheesy cliched thrillers that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else on while the plot a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them may be one of a kind i recognized countless plot twists probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reason br br to make matters worse i was not wild about the cast mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a mom or some sort of victim of foul play or abuse that one must wonder the kind of life she leads in this one she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly who was not a very good choice as the villain while sheila kelly has made some good career moves singles breaking in and i guess law and order she is also beset by a string of pitiful tv movie roles and this one just adds to it as for the others i don't have any clear memories of them so that must say something br br this one will play on the lifetime network i think that's where i saw it but don't bother watching it unless you are too bored for words not that it will make you any more excitied
<START> i have just started watching the tv series what i like about you and i must say that is a joy to watch i always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them i have watched amanda bynes since all that she is truly a funny girl what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is its something that a person could here there best friend saying its not rehearsed br br i just recently started watching the show and have fell in love i am just watching re runs as of now but am looking forward to the next season all the characters in the show give something to the whole story line its nice to see some old face from other shows i enjoyed watching in the past such as jennie garth from 90210 leslie grossman from popular and wesley jonathan from city guys the new character are very talented as well nick zano has that charm the makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong to holly bynes br br overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful i look forward to watching it grow
<START> it's been so long since i've seen this movie at least 15 years and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the geneva convention br br a unit of australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near japan following a successful mission to set mines in a japanese harbor br br once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other pows but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured the consequences of such an infraction by japanese martial code is execution by beheading br br despite their pleas and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb the tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad br br the ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here but i can promise you you'll never forget it good luck finding the video in the u s
<START> just two comments seven years apart hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling power as has been mentioned the low budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se br br true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror only without much horror more a case of intrigue gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments br br having picked the dvd up for a mere 3 95 last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure 10 95 would be an acceptable price for the film just don't expect fireworks
<START> one can deal with historical inaccuracies but this film was just too much practically nothing was even close to truth and even for the era it was seen as silly br br in defense of ford it was revealed on an old talk show that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real wyatt earp who was obviously old senile and replayed the scene his own way earp told the director about the stagecoach and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival so despite what other historians claim wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated br br this movie portrays earp as an honest man and also his brothers history doesn't exactly say they were or weren't most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters but that is nothing new the truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of gunfight at the ok corral men who saw it as a career and believe me in the old west you didn't have time to think about too much else br br characters that don't exist characters depicted dying at the corral who really didn't all make this a weaker film it is further weakened by mature who really didn't make a convincing doc he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth after all ford did get information first hand from wyatt earp br br it is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl hollywood was very pro nazi in those days and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to hitler idealism this occurs in most movies until the eighties it is no excuse and does cheapen the art however br br the actors who play the earps do well and brennan is always a thrill in fact mature may be the only acting downside of this flick still it is the weakest of the old ok corral movies
<START> i watched phat beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it the fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy the rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads phat beach is also funny because the low budget babes in this movie are strictly home girls most low budget movies have that local babe quality and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for jc penneys some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over used high mileage skank there were some cuties too that is the charm of these low budget crappy movies you will see a lot of doggies and some real cuties i checked up on some of them at imdb and seven years later phat beach is their only credit too bad it would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return what happened there are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on tv you wonder what ever happened to x anyhow this movie mostly blows but it has some funny moments
<START> without peter ustinov and maggie smith this could easily have been a turkey but they are brilliant ustinov is at his best and for fans of maggie it is great to see her in her early days matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing for englishmen in their fifties and i am in that bracket it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the swinging sixties and although this film spends a lot of time in offices it has plenty of sixties nostalgia including red buses carnaby street a song by lulu and a delicious shot up the micro skirt of a waitress the like of which england has never seen since in public places as an i t engineer i know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable but they are not meant to be taken seriously nor are the wonderful stereotypes of italians french and germans
<START> a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode
