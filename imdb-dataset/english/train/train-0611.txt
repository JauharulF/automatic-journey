<START> i admit that the majority of this film was uninspired but i was still entertained it has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy above average music and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves there's no prissies here i can think of dozens of other films that were way worse at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary they allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics destroy everything in sight even if it means the people you're supposed to be saving also how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work zombie beyond gates of hell in an effort to somehow improve on them he failed but definitely not miserably like a number of people would have you think i have a soft spot for zombie films so i admit that i'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them all i'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around if there wasn't so much descension in the making of this film fulci quit and bruno i can hack with the best of them mattei took over it could have been much better and more focused it's going to stay in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song one surprising note is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off i couldn't believe it myself check it out you'll be surprised
<START> so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so i duly responded here are some remarks br br vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed she also looks very old and i don't think this is achieved with much make up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema goers i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth mamie gummer's resemblance to her mother merly streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance she is surprisingly good however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor i agree with a previous comment natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films nell for example both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters their interplay is weak toni collette additionally is way too old for her character glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film eileen atkins provides some welcome dry wit especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to redgrave's character as for the men hugh dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed as a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film he also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people one of them a man are so much smitten by this man the backstory to this should have been developed more br br the cinematography is excellent as expected however the main summer house set failed to convince me it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill particularly with its grass patch in the front a bit too cardboard like br br overall the film is a classy production but a seen it all before cried at it all before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a tearjerker however it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time about one's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies
<START> this title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public for dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it i felt like it was 90mins wasted as i waited anxiously for a plot to develop or even begin br br try to fit this film into a genre and you won't because it lacks a beginning middle or ending i've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty abstract or original it just seems to me to be completely pointless br br i think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group no doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us that is if you can call it erotic it certainly didn't have taste
<START> when it comes to movies i am generally easily entertained and not very critical but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start i gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it what a waste of some great talent i was very disappointed with this movie as it was not what i expected
<START> i looked at this movie with my child eyes and i wasn't disappointed the story is well known some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio mamooth sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture br br briefly it works it is funny and it is a must see with your children they'll like it
<START> i'm a big fan of pacino movies he's one of if not the best actors of this genre however this movie could've been a whole lot better even though it had a poor cast all they had to do was tell the story of carlito brigante up until he went to jail instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of carlito all or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original could've been answered as far as i'm concerned thats the only way you can make this movie instead we get this prequel that has almost none of the original characters in it a character that plays a different part from the original horrible move and a totally different love interest for carlito don't even get me started with puffy no way can i take that cat seriously as a gangsta after watching him dance in all his artists videos evertytime that dude opened his mouth i was waiting for him to start dancing he made me laugh if anything mario van peeples surprised me with his role i thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history he did rather well he was probably the most believable out of the entire cast in my opinion jay hernandez did his best but doesn't have the skills right now in his career to take on this role i appreciated his energy and his efforts though hard to follow up pacino the only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person carlito was is to watch the original otherwise carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a spineless wimp in another he was one of the baddest gangstas of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie maybe this is a pitiful way for hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure wouldn't surprise me br br overall in my opinion this movie fell well short or what it could've been the only reason i gave it a 3 was because i laughed a lot and mario van peeples earned some respect back with me a serious director should've taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel i'm extremely disappointed that this movie wasn't taken seriously they would've been better off making this into a mini series on hbo and actually telling the story like the original suggests at the end of the movie they had the nerve to suggest that carlito would have to come back to the city heeellllo thats the part everyone wants to see then again this is all just my opinion i can't tell you how to waste your money
<START> have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots no me neither well i've finally seen one in spring in my hometown and i must confess now i know why people don't do this the technique is arty to be sure but it's definitely not ripe for public consumption the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions i don't know i can't read minds and i certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement br br but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti american sentiments as an american i'm well aware of my country's participation in the korean war and i'm very well aware that we weren't always angels but i'll be damn if i'll take this guy's version of how things happened according to this blind fool americans were not only at the root of the war we were the cause of the war and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country whatever mister director and i suppose you'd still be making this film in communist korea if we hadn't interfered right talk about forgetting your history this is almost akin to making the nazis the good guys while turning the allied forces into the bad guys this movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it's almost embarrassing to watch for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american interference he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental
<START> witty funny intelligent awesome i was flipping channels late one night years ago came across this and a wildfire started i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know a few like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time please do yourself a favor run don't walk watch this and enjoy intelligence and humor it's a win win situation i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of sanechaos
<START> you can call it a mystery perhaps a small thriller or an intelligent film br br the story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain it br br i have to say i was quite surprised that i truly did enjoy this film it is not usually the genre i care for however the characters quickly became people to me and i wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them br br just like many french films over english made we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person this film is character driven and will not disappoint
<START> american playwright howard w campbell jr played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte lives happily in germany with his actress wife helga noth sheryl lee before the beginning of world war ii at the peak of his life howard is drafted by an american agent john goodman to become a spy on behalf of the allies forewarned of the risks the job holds howard has everything to lose but finds the offer irresistible following the death of his wife and the end of the war campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city which muddies his neuroses even further the central question indeed a question that has frustrated many critics of the movie and kurt vonnegut's source novel is is campbell a hero or a traitor director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b weide offer us clues but no answer and this ambiguityÂthis not knowingÂis what keeps mother night fresh and interesting throughout at the beginning of the film nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident by the end he's either scared and uncertain or scared and completely certain of his contribution debt to humanity for the role he played in the war gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonnegut's dramatic side on the flip side when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment which he affectionately calls purgatory only to be discovered by a group of nazis the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds the moral even spiritual paradox mother night presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution and to a degree should be left ambiguousÂthe black and white scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toÂas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about the war changes him coming back to america changes him and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his act even further to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall spewing anti semitic bile perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for
<START> this movie blew me away if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of antz the plot characters and jokes are better in a bugs life also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits it's the best part of the movie rating 9
<START> without a doubt this is one of the worst pictures i ever actually paid money to see the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie and that is exactly how i came to see this stink bomb br br at the distance of the better part of three decades i can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line unbelievable plot that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea is laughable and that's about all except for a completely out of place love theme that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story at least charlotte rampling is lovely in a two dimensional role but richard harris just chews up the scenery he was no captain quint robert shaw and this is no jaws mercifully i have put most of it out of mind and when i run across it on television air casts i move on immediately danger will robinson see the current t v commercial showing a husband and wife whale watching orca i love orca at least it is over in sixty seconds this flick represents 92 minutes of my life that i will never get back
<START> 'deliverance' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature and instead have to fight for their sanity their lives and perhaps even their souls the film has aged well despite being made in the early seventies it certainly doesn't look particularly dated it still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post 'death of the sixties' philosophical and cultural shock vehicle there are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it although the legendary sam peckinpah's stuff would have to be up there yes there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene which i won't expand upon here and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times this seems to be generally overlooked yet in retrospect quite understandably so the cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning and it counterbalances the film as in a moment of brief madness we the viewers along with the characters themselves are plunged into unrelenting nightmare 'deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment through to crisis and aftermath it all takes place very quickly which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film the setting is established effectively through the opening credits the characters are all well drawn despite limited time spent on back story we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell the conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere with a frightening lack of logic this is author james dickey's theme that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore there are no demons or bogeymen here the predatory hillbillies as the film's central villains are merely crude terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists they shock because their evil is petty and tangible the film has no peripheral characters all reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised homo sapiens in the latter 20th century and all are very real and recognisable burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung ho and almost fatally over confident survivalist lewis and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up and down career 'boogie nights' excluded perhaps trust me if your are not a reynolds fan you will be impressed with his performance here john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self and ned beatty and ronny cox both make significant contributions this is simply a great quartet of actors to conclude i must speculate as to if and when 'deliverance' author james dickey's 'to the white sea' will be made for those that enjoyed this film ttws is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese mainland during ww2 it's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is dickey's trademark but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular poetic cinematic experience there was the suggestion a few years ago that the coen brothers might be producing it but that eventually came to nothing being an avid coen o phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on ttws rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts returning to 'deliverance' it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest unnerving brutality being made in these times and that is pretty shameful we the cinema going public are all the poorer for this
<START> 1st watched 2 16 2002 4 out of 10 dir arne glimcher mystery thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under estimates it's audience the movie going public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with we think that this movie is going to be about something with connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard contrived for the audience's sake run of the mill let's never get it over with thriller we are pulled into every silly switch in character as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends yes there is some good acting here especially from blair underwood fishburne and ed harris in a psycho supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long awaited end
<START> a long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released he doesn't remember first seeing the movie but he also doesn't remember life before it he does remember the first star wars themed gift he got a shoebox full of action figures from the original set he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets don't ask it's a northern illinois university thing br br i can't review star wars as a movie it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood there's no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up in the winter my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth i was always han solo my friends' dad built them a kick ass tree house and that served as the ewok village they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they don't i don't get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films br br i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like i'm eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker br br grade for the entire trilogy a
<START> okay this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars but i've voted for 10 to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big time hollywood productions performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive with notable turns by bill paxton james karen vivian schilling and brion james martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe lamp and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim but overall it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself
<START> hard to describe this one if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot though forry ackerman has not fared so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie it was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e brown comedy or abbott and costello if that's your thing basically just bad puns still i found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than 2 reasons good job but still a fundamentally flimsy production
<START> fantastic documentary of 1924 this early 20th century geography of today's iraq was powerful watch this and tell me if cecil b demille didn't take notes before making his the ten commandments merian c cooper the photographer later created cinerama an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film fans of werner herzog will find this film to be a treasure with heartbreaking tales of struggle complimented by the land around them never has the human capacity to endure been so evident the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects but of the filmmakers themselves
<START> i've seen the original english version on video disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising i can't believe i'm saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if you've seen disney's job of kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion but not quite finally miyazaki's films are being released properly i can't wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa
<START> when a man who doesn't have alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made he probably is the world's most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called 'eurotrash' his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the film's title is misleading for starters as any other franco film i've seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious br br devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america there's lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length br br the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and it's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesus br br anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english liverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest br br not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but it's gotta be done at some point and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera br br the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making but he doesn't muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam br br ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if you're trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and you'll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you'll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you'll never come across this film copies of it aren't just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it's franco lazy crazy franco
