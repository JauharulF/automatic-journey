<START> spoilers throughout br br i had read the book 1st to die and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it for the most part it did there were some minor differences location of the last violent scene for instance but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies br br this may have been a mistake although the movie was perfectly cast with pollen and bellows especially i was not that impressed with the book or let me take that back i started off very impressed gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped no difference with the movie here is why br br there is no payoff in the book or the movie rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it's final resolution and i had hoped the movie would vary a little br br the whole he did it no she did it no they both did it was not interesting not fascinating and more confusing annoying and depressing then anything else add to that that the love of lindsay's life dies at the end after her disease cleares and she cries at his grave and then cut to where she's contemplating suicide then all of a sudden she's in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested but it turns out he and the wife were in it together hello this whole thing has now become general hospital instead of a good old fashioned thriller i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie i must admit it held my attention nicely the acting was very good for a tv movie was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing br br i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book or maybe it's just that i knew what would happen but i have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all
<START> it's sort of hard for me to say it because i so greatly enjoyed both targets and paper moon but i thought the last picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly self indulgent film its main positive as far as i'm concerned is the stunning photography but for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that the characters were very hard to relate to or to care about basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on it was like american graffiti without the joy of life br br some might say this film is more realistic nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess but for me the film was simply oppressive and i want to see it again about as badly as i'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in br br maybe this film really just belongs to its time perhaps if i'd seen it in 1971 i would have been impressed by its novelty just by seeing something different on the screen but that would basically assume that i had never seen anything like say godard's breathless maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses but in the post tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either br br it is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth we see 3 films as i recall in the picture show first we see vincente minnelli's father of the bride liz taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to sonny's girlfriend and minnelli's studied upper middle class milieu contrasts to the character's real life surroundings in a similar way later clips from howard hawks' red river emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protÃ©gÃ© it really just reminds me that bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt much as he did if i remember correctly by selecting a hawks film as part of his own on screen reverie with boris karloff in targets i guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self indulgent like so much of the rest of this film br br ultimately i'd rather see another film by hawks ford or minnelli than to have bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less than subtle way maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation
<START> the toy box 1971 bomb br br sure i like looking at nude women while i prefer hardcore porn flicks i'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances well these aren't the right circumstances these aren't any circumstances there's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but i'll be damned if i can untangle it this is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place bah if i want to see good sex scenes i'll watch the real stuff
<START> although this is better than the first mulva which doesn't say much anyways i would rather watch paint dry it still sucks do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures guys i was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did i regret it some haven't even been officially released yet not bootlegs bought from the filmmakers themselves and i can't even list how bad they all are avoid anything with teen ape or bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with if you are friends of these guys chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them but for those that had to watch them no way bad video bad audio bad acting bad plot etc etc these aren't even funny i gave this one a 2 only because debbie rochon is in it and that is about it maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2 about a 1 1 16th star to show it was slightly better than the first which i wish i could have rated in the negatives if you want a decent no budget film go pick up something from lbp's friends over at freak productions like marty jenkins or even raising the stakes those are actually decent
<START> kolchak is sheer entertainment great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him simon oakland jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes erik estrada in legacy of terror phil silvers in horror in the heights antonio fargas in the zombie it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files darren rip simon rip ruth rip
<START> funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to romero's version tend to be very young judging by their other posts what we have here is a slick action packed gory and whoopee filled 2 hour mtv video frantic editing pop video camera work cool music blah blah blah br br actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes chainsaw massacre was a total disaster pretty good acting all round totally predictable in the who will die next stakes and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity br br don't remakes of classics get on your nerves can they really not come up with something original why remake dawn of the dead the things that made the original special the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy are totally missing this is an action flick plain and simple the faster the better if you are into action flicks and as this the 2004 version is well done fair enough but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films get ready to sigh again br br watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get the godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable pop director is at the moment and star wars remade with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds br br not bad but in 10 years they will still be discussing the romero version not this pap
<START> i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that it's not meant to replace the scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers i'm sure the cartoon's focus is on scooby and shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time if you are a fan of scooby doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it just enjoythe cartoon and support the creators writers and producers so that this won't be the last scooby cartoon
<START> after reading the first 5 reviews on imdb i was very enthusiastic about this movie but it's really an awful movie the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes the rest of the movie is cheap suspense the acting is over the top en the story oh boy which story br br the story doesn't seem to go in a direction first they capture the alien after 7 years they finally succeed then they don't know what to do with it after 7 years and even want to release it why the hell did they capture it then the girlfriend who's acting is the most over the top wants to walk away from this madness then suddenly she doesn't then again she does and then she doesn't then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race and remember in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens and what do they do they torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces br br this is my first review on imdb i'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon so listen to my warning this move is not worth your time don't watch this movie
<START> unimaginably stupid redundant and humiliating closure to the nightmare on elm street series part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke this isn't just the worst entry in the elm street saga it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre the story is dumb the character drawings are ridiculous the structure is all murky and Â most of all Â the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom jerry cartoon the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game character and pogo sticked him around the walls of a house the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle aged daughter you'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures but noÂ there's only one teenage survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure the john doe boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults how about that freddy krueger who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3d glasses sort of like ruins the whole essence doesn't it as far as i'm concerned nightmare on elm street has always been a dreadfully overrated series but up until now even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements freddy's dead however is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his her precious time watching it
<START> italian horror suspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn you know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home a huge rotting castle and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffe's fragile state of mind he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions poor aunt agatha she looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion another man is injected and then buried alive and of course there is a whole explanation as to why how evelyn did what she did director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best none of the actors look english many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldn't be caught dead in the cars drive on their wrong side of the road but all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too and of course any film with the sultry red headed erika blanc is always a plus there is a streak of sexual perversion however which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons c'mon
<START> being half portuguese doesn't render me half blind nor half prejudiced when discussing portuguese films not that i get to do that very often anyway but this film was such a rush of adrenaline yes that's right it was mostly accurate as far as history went goes but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese film territory things like using real locations in the middle of traffic congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago and by god did they get it right ok to sum it up very emotional if you've lived through it but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were if you're just watching it randomly you're in for a good historical romp only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought proving than usual even by european standards yes
<START> susan swift is an appealing youngster a flower child transplanted to the 1980's like a young susan dey but she doesn't quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine still she's rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile in the coming as it was called when briefly released to theaters swift may be the reincarnation of a salem witch the flick is very low budget and borrows from so many other pictures that i gave up on it with about 15 minutes to go it starts out strong and has some camp appeal obviously there are more serious films that deal with the salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one however as junk movies go it isn't too terrible the boston locales are a definite plus and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy 1 2 from
<START> dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives' however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me they aren't all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake
<START> we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new york's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this movie br br i understand that i can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but that's not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer
<START> this movie completely ran laps around the original dolemite it had everything that makes a movie great except for real actors ernie hudson couldn't do it alone and you know that lol i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible this movie has so many catchy lines it's pitiful i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and forwards i love jimmy lynch's character to death and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation but the oscars were never ready for this this is a random film consisting of crooked cops breasts chases bad editing and of course martial arts being that it's the 70's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters
<START> they have sex with melons in asia br br okay first i doubted that but after seeing the wayward cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the terrifyingly ugly leading man shoots it all into the lady's mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of hiv guess not br br the rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldn't take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people how gross is that and what's the message behind it all we need water we need melons we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks
<START> divorced lawyer rick magruder branagh stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss davidtz who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there seemingly by her father dixon doss duvall rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick and he then spends the night with her br br rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior rick now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison but when he is freed by his local friends rick finds himself in a trouble trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life
<START> atlantis the lost empire was everything the previews indicated it would be it is not often you find that most of the time the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible not so with this one i was pleased with the original plot even though the sub plots were not the animation was not break through like shrek but it was good none the less the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them this keeps you interested i found myself enjoying this one atlantis gets and keeps your attention you also have to think a little bit but not too much once you think about it a little you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen br br the casting was also good michael j fox as milo was an excellent choice his personality fits nicely the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner his character reminded me of his performance in maverick which i also liked i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting it's just too bad she is a villain br br over all definitely worth you while 8 out of 10
<START> wow the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists i know a lot of those the guys that'll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror this movie is utter crap it looks and sounds like a porno good lord the soundtrack is awful and has sub par porn acting which is shocking because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this most likely beans beans beans until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever when they could have had a very interesting central theme how do religious zealot anti abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed it's just awful like plan 9 from outerspace awful like good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode
<START> seriously i loved this film i had started to read the book and i loved it the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose i think this film did so well was because louis sachar wrote the screenplay and of course andrew davis directed it shia lebouf gives a great performance for his first film the storyline is very cool and interesting there's humor heart and intensity it is very similar to the book i find this film to be not the least bit boring i absolutely loved it and i encourage anyone to read the book all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted two thumbs up for me in every single way
