<START> perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it's not it's certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork first there is the director's touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen tony montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people's living rooms there are the many superb one liners count how many times the word f ck is used there are the superb little details the pan american globe that screams the world is yours or the great discomusic from giorgio moroder nothing can be named that isn't sublime here and it easily is along with the godfather good fellas and white heat one of the best gangstermovies ever made
<START> i like brad pitt enormously he is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face pectorals and all the rest since i saw him in thelma and louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of troy did it for me he is the new brigitte bardot the differences are obvious of course male american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it kalifornia 12 monkeys fight club snatch his self deprecating humor makes him human almost accessible fortunately troy will soon be forgotten only still photographs with pitt semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans strange das boot is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this well i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new brigitte bardot
<START> yet another venture into the realm of the teen gross out comedy set on a college campus featuring a nerd's quest to coolness and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl it's all been done before and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner the gross out humor that has made teen flicks like american pie and dude where's my car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove the film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable i won't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging as it's a waste of my time and yours at best slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable br br jason schwarzman who impressed in his debut rushmore humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast please avoid please avoid save your money
<START> i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd br br james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life which is not all rosy his wife an excellent portrayal by vera miles lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and they even separate for a time chip's best friend and fellow agent sam crandall murray hamilton is killed in a gunfight chip's son mike enlists in the marines during world war ii through it all the family carries on with bravery and dignity br br the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi documentary style of the film works effectively and the music by max steiner says it all fidelity bravery and integrity br br this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and yes to j edgar hoover as well if mr hoover's type of vigilance had been observed we might have been spared 9 11 the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing
<START> boring badly written italian exploitation flick lots of nudity gore and awful acting the werewolf makeup was the only thing that would raise a laugh complete rubbish even for fans of cheesy italian horror please avoid
<START> mike brady michael garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic the warriors is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town not just any slugs mind you but carnivorous killer bigger then normal mutated by toxic waste slugs who still only go as fast as a normal slug which isn't that frightening but i digress no one will believe him at first but they will oh yes they will br br ok killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below johnathon winters as mork's baby in the creepiness factor so the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go the flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety i appreciate that they spelled out that this was slugs the movie as opposed to slugs the children's game or slugs the other white meat probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game director juan piquer simÃ³n is more widely known for his previous films pod people which mst3k deservedly mocked and peices which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made br br eye candy kari rose shows t a br br my grade d br br dvd extras merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
<START> i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy brosnan is genius as anyone will now testify he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie what an unexpected pleasure my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town' brosnan delivered this very un bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse i was also very impressed with hope davis's performance it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man' you will definitely like this br br i voted 10
<START> i'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this however the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies it's definitely something that most people will not get as is the nature of absurdism br br the animation is horrible but yes that's the point the main character is foul mouthed violent and stupid no redeeming qualities whatsoever his wife shrieks and wails apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills most of these stories completely lack any kind of point br br but again that's the point br br if non sequiters foul language and complete and utter randomness are your thing you're going to love this br br it is really short so i would probably rent instead of buying
<START> tapeheads a scrappy intermittently funny spoof of the music video business might have been the perfect comedic short and stars john cusack and tim robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved they play two semi savvy security guards in los angeles who start their own company video aces making hilarious videos for groups parties and one deathbed star it's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side plot to pad the running time shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength sending up the music culture of the late '80s still cusack and robbins create a couple of originals here nerdy but loose street smart without being hipsters or posers these guys are on the same nutty wavelength and they never put each other down they're the real thing in buddy comedies 1 2 from
<START> from watching only the trailer to theodore rex you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with whoopi goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume that is true but this is mostly a futuristic story which looks a lot like batman forever with it's direction style and weird character designs it was mismarketed and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale instead of just a lame cop comedy whether or not this movie is mismarketed it's still a horrible movie br br in the future dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology and they talk and walk around like humans teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously but after a dinosaur is murdered he's given the case to work on but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all katie coltrane whoopi goldberg it's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud br br teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character but by the end he is unbearable to listen to for some reason along with being a detective he's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator he does imitations of famous people and accents and has some truly awful lines whoopi blames him for farting and he says it's not my butt trumpet wow what a puerile immature line even for a kid's movie of this caliber whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone i was hoping teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film br br this movie never knew what it wanted to be when the futuristic scenes and action occur there is no comedy or humor in any non action scenes the characters try to be as funny as they can which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome the action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough and as stated earlier the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes nothing ever works here br br having a dinosaur human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie if nothing else nope this movie is a huge rip off of who framed roger rabbit just replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future and it's the exact same plot a man is killed a dinosaur is killed a dinosaur and detective solve the murder a toon and detective solve the murder the bad guys in roger rabbit are christopher lloyd and weasels the bad guys here are a guy who sounds like christopher lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels the club scene in roger rabbit where jessica rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs this is a huge rip off of a much better movie br br overall this is a bad movie not even deserving of it's straight to vhs stature br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg for mild violence language and crude humor
<START> we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite
<START> pecker is another mainstream film by john waters done on a smaller than serial mom the title character of pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees it doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when he takes pictures he soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work pecker live in a semi normal middle class family his dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street his mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress up poor people his older sister tina works at a gay bar where her specialty is trade his younger little chrissy has a habit of eating sugar sugar and nothing but sugary food his grandmother memama has a small statue of the virgin mary and plays ventriloquist with it he also has 2 friends on of his friends matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend shelley runs a laundry mat as if she was a dictator soon a tourist from new york buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery with the picture comes fame but the pictures expose the unusual life style of his friends and family's simple life for an r rated film pecker is sure tamer than most of waters previous r rated films and even pink flamingos another 10 out of 10
<START> there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them this film shows it as it is it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop this is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong
<START> from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu i'm so wooden i could be a plank me reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites pun not intended the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the 2nd segment which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist' wish i'd spent the Â£3 99 it cost me on something else like erm natural born killers directors cut if you do buy this you're really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague if you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere like dog soldiers wolfen romasanta the werewolf hunt
<START> maybe i need to have my head examined but i thought this was a pretty good movie the cg is not too bad i have seen worse the look of the creatures and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake was pretty cool the action scenes involving the snakes was really good i thought there are some lapses in logic at times and the story doesn't always make sense but for a creature feature there are a lot worse a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies so it's not wholly original i think the gist of the story is original though there is a bit of similarity to godzilla the big budget american version which liked a lot i didn't like this movie as much but i still say it was pretty good i also liked the music all in all i think dragon wars is about a 7 10
<START> gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing brilliant even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics or the zaitochi series another fine example of this genre is onmyoji 2001 i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai 2002 and shintaro katsu's zatoichi the blind swordsman 2003
<START> following the success of paris je t'aime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly by the time you think are getting into a story it's over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin again with the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure br br sadly however while paris je t'aime was hit or miss mostly hit most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet and often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my wrists among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much and i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much br br by the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture br br also if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool fedora eating a hotdog and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world including a very unhappy couple
<START> the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the blithe innocent pecker played appealingly by edward furlong who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include pecker's friend matt he's a thief but he's really a nice guy pecker's sister chrissy who is addicted to sugar and pecker's catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her room br br the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy handed about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject br br i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun
<START> this film was almost a great imaginative film a mixture of shakespeare pop jazz and faerie tales this movie was an imaginative twist on the cinderella theme featuring a strong cast headed by the perfectly cast kathleen turner this movie had everything going for it everything but production values i almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets but with an over the top production like this it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie besides better cinematography this film was almost perfect br br
<START> i wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night
