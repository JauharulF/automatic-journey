<START> this really should have been a one star but there was so many clichÃ©s predictable twists seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh although this was never the directors intention im sure br br i don't often write comments about films they have to be either sensational or in this ones case really bad br br to be honest as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films br br somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t not relay mr t but you'll know what i mean if you bother to watch this if you do watch it make sure you don't pay to see it this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it but im sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all
<START> i saw crispin glover's what is it at the ann arbor film festival admittedly the film was at least aptly named because i got the distinct sense that even the writer director could provide no answer at the question and answer session after the screening mr glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down syndrome however this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film actors are in my opinion building blocks for a larger vision a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst br br crispin glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects well he does do that but why the film seems to have no stance no reason for addressing anything does he feel these things shouldn't be taboo the film doesn't even give me an indicator of that taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting it can't even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he hasn't made the audience care in any way br br ignoring problems with the concept for a moment the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together the editing cinematography and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur glover said 125 150 thousand dollars went into the movie and i feel that the money should have been spent on different designers glover actually did some design himself i know i saw at least sound design in the credits the painted sets are okay not great but used poorly parts feel like a photographed stage play which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose but in glover's hands it just feels sloppy other parts are filmed like a sort of home movie of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff i see first time filmmakers do on imovie br br perhaps the biggest problem with what is it is i can't even understand how seriously the film is to be taken there are some parts that feel like glover is screaming at you to think seriously at other points he seems off on his own little joke perhaps he meant for this to be ironic or meaningful in some way but i just felt that glover couldn't even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attention br br glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film if only it had been at seventy two minutes the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time
<START> i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didn't expect spike lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tension mob justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme opinion br br the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90 min format with more focus less tangential sub plots br br don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an escapist movie
<START> the screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life i'll never get back where have i heard this before the acting is so so things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie while the first cube was a nerdy horror movie which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer the comic thing is the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them but the scenes are just copied over there is no coherence whatsoever this script is sooo pointless i can imagine it being written by some half wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project the best part is in the end they cripple the 'good' wunderkind guy and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie and you see him when they find him 'this room is green ' in cube 1997 goodie gooodie clap clap what a twist first of all what about if you haven't seen the first one this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director oh another great idea instead of the numbers to identify x y z coordinates of the room cube 1997 this time it is 3 letters each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values duh except now permutations don't make much sense anymore so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them i want my money back br br i guess i had to write this down since there are just so many bad inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie directors writers should be required to possess some talent
<START> as a single woman over 40 i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isn't much of an actress to begin with but given the non existent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didn't have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathy empathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then there's the obligatory male fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try please br br not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those 112 minutes of my life back what a ripoff
<START> love it or loathe it it's hard to not find warren beatty's take on dick tracy the 1990 film adaptation of chester gould's famous comic strip anything short of a genre classic superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become a genre all on its own br br beatty's film liberally uses gould's source material to full effect shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger happy mutant gangsters and loose seductive women a lush visual style and tone br br it can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short change the characters and their acting abilities which i don't think can be any further from the truth br br dick tracy relishes in its look and ghastly characters and beatty himself who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs br br other than the visual treats and oscar winning makeup there is a plot and big boy caprice al pacino deliciously over the top in an oscar nominated performance seeks to eliminate tracy in one well planned move but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him br br tracy meanwhile is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart glenne headly who as her name would have it remains faithfully by his side and cares for the kid charlie korsmo who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime busting hero tracy's fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advances of breathless mahoney madonna who is also big boy's main squeeze at the same time that all of this is going down things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides against the middle br br the performances are good as beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest br br dick tracy is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre i think that if chester gould was still alive he would be proud of warren beatty's take on his beloved crime fighting detective br br 8 10
<START> some people loved the aristocrats and others hated it frequently walking out in the middle reactions to eddie izzard aren't likely to be that extreme if you can handle a transvestite comedian who says he likes girls and has a vocabulary that makes shall we say enough use of the f word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television many of izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances on the other hand i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and in spots absolutely hilarious he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines he's not a story teller he's not a joke maker he's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams he plays around with ideas some of which work and some of which a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz for instance are completely unfunny he has a way however of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 but a 10 no way
<START> oh man how low serials had fallen as by 1952 this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes from misery not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter and that couldn't possibly be there tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump but i think this serial has the world's record of stock footage i mean most of it is stock footage and not just from another serials apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men and the cool molten rocks scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel but from itself the whole trip to the moon sequence which is probably the shortest ever it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earth's atmosphere from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8 and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10 11 and 12 well they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again br br don't get me started on the science factor prepare to see the sunniest moon ever and moon men that can not breathe on their own world what were they smoking br br and if this is not enough it's too talky and the stunts usually the best thing in serials are few and far visually wise am i the only one who thinks that commando cody's bullet shaped or is it lemon shaped helmet is totally ridiculous looking the rocketeer's was way cooler no matter how bad that movie was and man was it awful the tank like vehicle isn't much better it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk hey everybody has the right to be an hero but then he's so unappealing br br not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake see captain marvel instead 2 10 br br btw check out the memorable quotes section for a real women's lib pearl
<START> i meant that in a good way believe me true to life it ain't the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick but you do enjoy the cast here flynn smith bond watson frawley etc all good i also liked seeing mike mazurki of course he played a boxer what else typical forties flick teeming w familiar faces and fast paced scenes one after the other br br flynn is fine as gentleman jim you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here i suppose but it's okay it's a cartoon and meant to please that's all the boxing scenes were pretty good ward bond's vaudeville logging act a riot and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times br br really alotta fun flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him br br outta
<START> this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store don't make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
<START> this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies' biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldn't help but notice that cuba's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general that's right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba's except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe
<START> i'm not a big fan of rom coms at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an insomniac but this one is just more of the same but less br br with a running time of 100min i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out lee's character br br all i can say is avoid i gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you br br 3 of out 10 and only cos i'm a big lee fan
<START> there's one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie
<START> we laughed our heads off this script is so incredible you either zap to cnn or go to sleep br br my dad was a sea captain for 30 years he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie br br during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey daily and sorry s t on his desk of course this was not on a nuclear mission br br for instance the fire in the kitchen fire is the most important thing on any ship nuclear or not to give a drill at that time is just hollywood script when a captain is put under arrest he is under arrest you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept this is stored within minutes in a well guarded room he cannot escape it's just like in prison br br funny thing is my dad also had a dog on board however we see how hackman let him pee in the control room this is not done ever my dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was br br hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for all the rest is bulls t br br when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the koersk this film gets an extra dimension br br if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent thas boat br br
<START> certain dvd's possess me until i just have to go out and buy it this was one of those movies like many on here i remember seeing it as a child and loved it i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut so i was intrigued to see what they might be i will agree that the portabellow road sequence is now a tad long as is the soccer game but other than that i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place perhaps disney should have had the original version which is the restored version on one side with the restored version on the flip side then people could choose what they wanted to view all in all it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories
<START> by dane youssef br br a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong they're in trouble the police are outside they're cornered what are they gonna do now br br sound familiar br br the movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theater br br it's the kind of things that actors love it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planning giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up br br a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off there's a bit of a fender bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield br br the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dino's last chance br br spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passion red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence off screen really br br i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge br br the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang br br gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag along with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul swearing mad dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs but he isn't given anything to really do here br br william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood br br and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this br br spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and they're to calm and too articulate there's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh bother br br these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldn't the holed up crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening inside br br someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation off screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's well kinda sad but br br faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part br br a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield br br the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it's as profane but never as realistic or as insightful br br the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really low budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's not bad but needs a few more re writes spacey shows he's not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he's just filming actors act br br these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting br br i don't mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely br br having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvement br br when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors acting br br sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for it br br hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming of age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well br br there are a few really great entries into this genre ' spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiator br br this certainly won't become a cult classic let alone one of afi's 100 still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv it's just not worth going out of your way to see br br i give a 3 out of 10 br br spacey's other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe it's true you need to fail before you succeed br br by dane youssef
<START> i would like to know why john amos left the show and how did he die off the show again i couldn't relate to everything but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing by the way did they ever make it out of the ghetto i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite we got to see them experience a few good times something they didn't have very often i wish they would bring the show back during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch i don't think a movie or a new show would work especially without the original cast they are really what made good times goodtimes these are my questions and comments thank you
<START> this film is about a man's life going wrong his business is failing and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts br br the plot is complete chaos it simply does not make sense in fact nothing in the film makes sense the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it it is a shame because the sets and costumes are done well and are visually stimulating enough the shots are well composed throughout the film however these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film it is such a waste of their talents this film is very bad avoid it
<START> saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once beirut what do you know about beirut beirut he's the best damn baseball player who ever lived br br you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v vikings monday night football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy
<START> i like this movie a lot but it's a fact that you cannot understand it unless you're from the ex yugoslavia most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection macedonia serbia montenegro bosnia and herzegowina croatia slovenia br br all of this was ex yugoslavia a melting pot of the balcan nations it could be a dream land if slobodan milosevic franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldn't poison the nation's mind with their sick ideas
