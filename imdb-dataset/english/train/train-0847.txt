<START> my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldn't find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u s in feb 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington d c in march 1958 wonder if it was re released or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john mcintyre does a bang up job as a corrupt judge entrepreneur thief walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty six minutes
<START> i watch bad movies br br this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie not an ounce of humor not an ounce of talent throughout br br i am lazy br br usually i see a bad movie and curse this was so bad i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to br br i am smashing my copy of this movie br br it's too lame even to use clear a room so boring watch 'bloodsucking freaks' or 'shock shock shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment this sludge looks awful is awful and whoever made it should feel awful
<START> this is a typical 70's soft core sex romp in the russ meyer genre though perhaps less outlandish than some of meyer's work this film has higher 'production values' than many of it's contemporaries suggesting a larger budget it's plot writing and acting are straight out the b zone though of late this film has become a mainstay of b movie channels such as drive in classics in the 500 channel universe if soft core is what you are in the mood for this is as good as anything else in the b range don't expect polanski though sarno is just sarno nothing more nothing less jennifer welles performance as the mother is perhaps the best of the cast none of the actors in the film went on to greater fame unsurprisingly confessions of a young american housewife is far from the worst example of it's kind it is watchable if this is your type of film 30 years ago this would have been an avant garde and riske film you can see more or less the same kind of thing on showtime hbo series these days and in prime time
<START> note to george litman and others the mystery science theater 3000 riff is i don't think so breeder br br my favorite riff is why were you looking at his 'like' simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not over all i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really can't make much fun of the dialog bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do better br br i would recommend that you buy a book and read 'hamlet'

<START> romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe how to lose friends alienate people the underlying romance in the plot is for the most part displaced by a far more interesting rags to riches tale although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed in several screen shots it does have a sense of getting the nitty gritty out of the way focusing on those key relationships which make office politics and using those almost irrelevant scenes used purely for comic effect yet it works so well especially with pegg in the front seat the film is ultimately very clever playing well on the trans atlantic relationship pegg shares with his co stars and merging the cross between the high and low life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey the different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film both the trading places relationship between pegg and huston and the love hate relationship between pegg and dunst do work so well in a story that is for want of a better word charming even fox whose main asset is of course sex appeal shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that bimbo role all to well its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work from transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy
<START> gorgeous bodies gorgeous colors and camera work pretentious dialog banal plot the name of the prima donna camilla and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from dumas' novel la dame aux camelias the movie camille starring garbo and i think robert taylor and last but not least verdi's opera la traviata beautiful not too virtuous young ladies social outcasts for one reason or another loved split up reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene one forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera but why waste hayak don sutherland a beautiful rendition of la in the 30s a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn't even any beautiful singing
<START> frank tashlin's 'the home front' is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster 'the home front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy it's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risquÃ© card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact
<START> have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to outdo it the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career even the many charms of ms diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid it's obviously a style of film that americans haven't really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and you'll see what i'm talking about but don't say i didn't warn you
<START> that was great fun i never read those chester gould comics but it's not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didn't figure out but what the eye doesn't see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are good humoured all together the setting is similar to that in the Âbatman movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not self evident and a more or less surprising ending br br with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends don't watch the credits at the beginning and then look who's the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make up
<START> what a delightful romp Â a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack einstein is brilliantly acted by walter matthau while meg ryan's catherine is unforgettable Â better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom hanks Â as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized br br you don't need to be a young woman to understand catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through ed's tim robbins mind in pursuing his true love there's universal appeal in these emotions even if i q keeps it all light fun and tied up nicely br br sure it's not heavy but if you look there are some subtexts people remember albert einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist his sayings such as something along the lines of 'if it is not impossible then why do it ' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp in this film there are questions of what an accident really is Â such as whether albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying catherine away from stiff upper lip loveless james stephen fry Â who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling counts how much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see and comes across as serendipitous br br and of course we'd like to think in real life despite what we often observe of the people we know that we edwards get the catherines and jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins how nice to know that it might work out in i q 's innocent and disturbingly exclusively caucasian eisenhower era land of make believe
<START> a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers bobby myers matthew modine and paul linder saul rubinek trying to make their first film in the late 1970s hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together despite a number of conflicting threads br br hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap 1984 works so well namely although exaggerated in some ways it is very close to the truth and the truth consists of behind the scenes facts that are very different than the public face of the industry it isn't easy to make a film and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s films involve tens if not hundreds of people many have incompatible desires motivations and personalities especially crucial are the financiers and the on screen talent as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production it could jeopardize the whole affair either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether br br so it's not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time the script is flawless and the performances are top notch this is a must see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film making it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor br br a 10 out of 10 from me
<START> this was a strange kind of film about a low lifes in new york city and centering around a main character the title name played by brad pitt who thinks he''s a ricky nelson type musician except he has no real talent br br it's kind of fun to watch until a profane tough new york city type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over that ruined the film for me it must have been catherine keener who usually plays tough and garbage mouthed women br br the hairdo on pitt an exaggerated pompadour was fun to look at i can picture johnny depp playing this role better one last note it odd to hear a film made in 1992 other than woody allen's with just mono sound
<START> i have had the chance to watch several movies in bluray and hd dvd this movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch now on the blu ray scale in many blu ray movies you either get two things a picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture i was disappointed when i made this my first blu ray movie i almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard although after watching other movies i know better i don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd that is generally the problem with some movies and for the price of blu ray players and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version
<START> spoilers the film sniper is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos gunny hathcock the unassuming soft spoken mister rogers look alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in nam which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is br br tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit man backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country br br the story of the film sniper is focused on sgt beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller billy zane being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze frederick miraglittoa and colombian drug king pin raul ochoa carlos alveraze who's supporting him in a planned a military take over of the country br br we see earlier in the movie sgt beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in sniper for it shows step by step how sgt beckett with the help of his spotter cpt papich aden young does his job there's also a sub plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva eward wiley who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait br br what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo like ending with sgt beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog br br sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy
<START> i loved this movie when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it it comes out to buy on july 24th it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story good acting great slasher film the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls see this movies
<START> i usually check out the mtv movie awards to watch a witty entertaining show that delivers a unique award show chewbacca winning a life time achievement award as example so this year was no different while i'm not a fan of justin timberlake seann william scott has always been funny albiet stupid to me i've laughed at stiffler in both american pie movies and even enjoyed him in dude where's my car but the mtv movie awards were simply horrible nothing was coherrent humorous or entertaining justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing he sure as hell can't act br br i'm curious as to who the writers were for this show last year's performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny the lord of the rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show but this year was completly different did anyone understand timberlake's comments regarding luke wilson and kate hudson they're staring in a movie together but have never met here they are where was the joke kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue never making a reference to the joke by timberlake and seann was completly wasted as a talent not even causing me to smile yet alone laugh and what was the point of harrison ford's one liners did they make any sense to anyone perhaps the mtv writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging ford as han solo indiania jones or the president from air force one i'm baffled and would someone tell me the deal with adrian brody how old is this guy and how old does he think he is the guy looks 30 trying to act 19 again give it up show some class like in your best actor academy award speech and act your age br br i give this show 1 star out of 4 simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance this was very creative extremely well done and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening
<START> this film should have been fun a young lea thompson a young joaquin phoenix and terry o'quinn in space but it dragged on had unlovable characters and had no target audience br br some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs named appropriately jinx the space scenes are then long repetitive the same accident happens twice and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view adults will be bored and cheesed out kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it br br there is a budding romance but unlike the shuttle this never takes off why it is included in the first place is unclear except maybe to add extra tension between the characters but it failed if that was the idea br br a young lea thompson should be quirky and attractive right i mean back to the future is great but no she was irritating and average looking not someone you'd want to date have as a friend or even consider as a role model joaquin phoenix he's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance maybe he can act like mikey in the life cereal commercials but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy he doesn't fit in on screen and i don't think we can identify with him at home i actually would have been happier if he had never returned to earth br br i don't recommend this film to anyone
<START> first a quick 'shut up ' to those saying this movie stinks you can't go to every movie expecting 'citizen kane' this was actually a fun movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only flaw in this movie is i don't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles they should have dwelled more on that other than that the movie is good fun selma blair needs to eat something she's worrying me but she still looks beautiful so yes i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go see br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> it's possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day but i seriously doubt it br br james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out folks like dennis weaver claude akins john marley and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film br br garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at playing them but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children's hour and hour of the gun he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully but a man called sledge can't be counted as one of his successes br br he's got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures he's followed from the saloon by john marley br br marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run garner gets his gang together for a heist br br here's where the movie goes totally off the wall usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed br br that was just too much to swallow if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns during that prison break there's enough there for three movies br br that's not the whole thing of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency br br the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits but for the life of me i can't find him in the film maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better br br couldn't have hurt any
