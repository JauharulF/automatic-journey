<START> if you have seen very less films this might be a big one for you if you have seen lot of films this is a joke the acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly not to mention there are songs there are lot of flashbacks and most importantly the fighting scenes are stupidily performed new characters good direction would have done a better job but since it contains all the bollywood heros heroines you can predict whats going to happen next you do not feel sad when something happens the emotions they protray is terrible mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies it suppose to be a realistic movie but it fails to show there are times you wondering you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid there were only a few characters acting that was very good but as far it is concerned with plot action it is poorly directed this movie could have been short if they took out songs flashbacks stick to the point
<START> cia codename alexa is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson's classic film la femme nikita 1990 the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o j simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history lamas' acting is simply a bad steven segal impersonation watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience br br the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable there are so many action movie conventions in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc the musical score resembles david michael frank's score for hard to kill 1990 which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie there is plenty of martial arts in the film and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up and i have to admit i was mildly entertained br br lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters my recommendation is that you skip cia codename alexa and check out la femme nikita instead
<START> this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse br br the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it it's also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn't let the film down it's also terrible
<START> ludicrous violations of the most basic security regs are only the beginning it's hard to see how they achieved such abysmal trash on such a low budget i turned it off once then got curious to see if it could get any worse it did
<START> the opening shot was the best thing about this movie because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate well crafted independent film damn that opening shot for filling me hope as the film progressed in a slow plodding manner my thoughts were varied in relation to this film was there too much butter in my popcorn did the actors have to pay the director to be in this film did i get my ticket validated at the box office yes dear reader i saw this film in the theatre this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre because at home you can turn it off were there any redeeming values peter lemongelli as the standard college nerd had his moments especially in a dog collar other than that this film went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter it succeeded on none of these fronts oh and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad her performance was the only comedy i found
<START> i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet now i've seen the film what a ride and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems such a courageous wise funny and talented spirit and what a crew to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon the excitement of rafting through some rapids the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi and the phone calls home and as always boys will be boys this film needs to be seen by everyone young and old alike darius and his mother are models of strength and courage and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation they got darius a new wheelchair they documented accessibility problems they took darius on the trip of his life and they touched many many lives by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west a cure for dmd
<START> i have watched some pretty poor films in the past but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it br br i am a fan of most genres and enjoy shoot 'em up games but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable br br as most have already said there was hardly any script and the acting was weak i won't waste my time describing it br br anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or sega or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment br br i must say i was more annoyed with the video shop who gave this a thumbs up which led me to rent it thank god i had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies br br comic book guy would be right if he said worst movie ever
<START> bad at being intentionally bad br br this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen while it's obvious the movie isn't trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgeted br br in short paint my muscle car prune colored
<START> if the man in the white suit had been done in america can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size br br this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree br br alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment br br he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist br br it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent but it glows like a neon sign br br other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk br br come to think of it did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever
<START> a great british indy movie fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug fuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of great to see phil daniels back on the big screen even if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies loved the final fight scene with it's nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the pops he's not acting he really is a bona fide british hippie you don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my friday night post pub repeat viewing collection br br give this film a go and you won't be disappointed
<START> i think phillip kaufman read the cliff's notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film okay of course it won't have the punch of the original kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs this film does not even try the one dream sequence of tereza's so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel day lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this i know it's not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywood izing of otherwise fine literature
<START> this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies released br br the animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view it's a story to entertain not to question br br still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
<START> spoiler warning br br absolutely without a doubt one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen totally impossible to take any of this seriously it would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it during the glory days of her program carol burnett and company who often did take offs on films skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine carol played jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from harvey korman played oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked ryan o'neal the only thing funnier than this bit is the real film br br what a death scene at the end jenny really looks like she's dying alright dying for her make up artist to come in and give her a little color and of course we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient's final moments the ending scene with ryan o'neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic he had plenty to worry about he never did recover from this
<START> ice age is not only animation of the year in my eyes it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen br br the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website scrat is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes br br the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed it's hard to say which one really steals the picture br br i experienced their journey with laughter tears and amazement nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 also a fox production and before that it was the land before time 1988 all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the cynics 10 10 br br
<START> i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity for one if stallone is out free climbing by himself there's no need to carry any gear but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta mountain climby so let's throw them in for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy where the movie was filmed well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous foul smelling stuff for you to swallow
<START> an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids vomiting or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror type go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone
<START> friday the 13th step over there is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there i won this movie in a contest at college and it was a waste of money even if it was free jack jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something at least friday the thirteenth never bored me i'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again
<START> i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery while i knew it was only a b film a space western i loved it it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non the less held my imagination and provided great escapism sadly our society has so much available discounting small attempts is too easy in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another's life or my own while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy predictable i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph my world is really too cynical
<START> this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind this movie reminds me of the low budget thriller blood song with frankie avalon staring in it the same motive just a different character part it's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back
<START> the good earth is a great movie everybody must see it is tear jerking and very heart warming it caters to the enhancement of values formation on perseverance humility and the love of family the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such he may be left defenseless and useless i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors their emotions has captivated the audience the movie may have been done in black and white but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end that makes it really great there should be a re make for this very nice movie
