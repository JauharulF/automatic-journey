<START> now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids br br here's basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugh a lot two made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to and three it's a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil it's a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged it's very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the never ending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy it br br it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it so don't over analyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it
<START> originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there what follows is rape torture beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion br br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even worse there's plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help br br i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended
<START> this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not inherit his father's skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watch br br i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews br br let's see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks would that be enough br br i regretted every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie it's as if a franÃ§ois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney br br brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking
<START> and ethel merman buffs too will love her loud bossy vocals as the wicked witch mombi but this cartoon sequel to the wizard of oz is bereft of real imagination substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video little dorothy is whisked back to oz which has gone to ruin and meets old and new friends the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less inspired shows from hanna barbera however many of the songs are good particularly dorothy's sweet lament it's a far away land superbly performed by liza minnelli you can count on minnelli for energy which is why the movie perks up whenever dorothy is around much of it is unmemorable and i'm not even sure baby boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long as a curiosity item just fair from
<START> this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and bleached out which only added to the spacey fumbling weird vibe of the whole thing br br it's not for everyone i mean it's not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it it's unlike anything i have ever seen before unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy and pimply that you can't help but feel for them in other words these are far from hollywoodized versions of teenagers br br all of which for me makes it a good thing
<START> i saw that when i was little and it was excellent kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius karen boettcher tate as profster was interesting burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon this story is about when lisa snoodle doodle go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
<START> this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad and indeed we couldn't take most of it there was a lot of fast forwarding going on br br but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time cripes i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times i'm estimating forty or so and i've never laughed so hard in my life you see englund has this thing for showing off his loins i last saw the film a couple months ago but i can't stop laughing as i type anyway the scene is a montage of shots englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head this is absolute genius you've got to see it for yourself
<START> i will say that at least the movie makes sense but it's bad the acting for the most part is not good i think only sky showed any promise and you feel awkward watching it all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow like when ng comes out to her parents there are a lot of corny details like the kanji tattoo on the sky's shoulder the magnets on the girls' refrigerator and the god awful decor at the sets and the music and clothes and everything real life has never been like this movie the boy says at one point i'm gay not corny and not aware even the commentary is awful i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian
<START> in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time four city guys confront nature's wrath in a story of survival the setting is backwoods georgia with its forests mountains and wild rivers br br the director john boorman chose to use local people not actors to portray secondary characters these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history no central casting actors could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces voices or actions i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful as much as anything else it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing br br another strength is the film's theme nature in the wild can be violent how appropriate that the setting should be the american south very few places in the u s are or have been as violent as redneck country in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature not separate from it br br deliverance is very much a product of its time when unlike today americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness the film's magnificent scenery the sounds of birds frogs crickets and the roar of the river rapids combined with the absence of civilization all convey an environmental message and that is another strength of the film br br at an entertainment level the tension gradually escalates as the plot proceeds not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme and then never lets up not until the final credits roll very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot br br finally the film's technical quality is topnotch direction and editing are flawless cinematography is excellent dialogue is interesting and the acting is terrific burt reynolds has never been better ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar if there is a weak link in the film it is the music which strikes me as timid br br overall deliverance almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure even for those who don't the gritty characterizations the acting and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film one of the finest in cinema history
<START> i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd the acting throughout is excellent no question there was not quite enough action for me i must say no real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development nothing like tinker tailor in terms of whodunnit if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent br br the film portrayed the life of a traitor a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time time again as a crook and a con man pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him wife son mentor pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence it has eaten his moral fibre away he has no real love or loyalty in him br br heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series very well done though
<START> i haven't seen henry fool but after watching fay grim i'm not sure i want to maybe hartley aims to be the anti thriller director he sure succeeded with this yawner based on the official description woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security i expected a taut geopolitical drama instead i got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time i can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard to follow plot e g duplicity because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together even when they don't or they do but they leave lingering questions e g duplicity sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest but half way through fay grim i reached a deadly realization i didn't know what was going on and i didn't care too bad because i really like parker posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists there's also bad casting jeff goldblum can be very good but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of american idol are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages goldblum was 54 when he made fay grim thomas jay ryan who plays henry fool was 44 neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages yet a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua back in the '70s goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then henry fool would've been a teenager was hartley being quirky or lazy the problems are too numerous to list
<START> serge farnel made a very precise critics of this film in the revue the rwandese night www lanuitrwandaise net br br a critics which shows how france was behind all the situation undergone by the united nations in rwanda br br the un soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the french soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces br br the day before ten un soldiers had been killed by the genocide forces br br that is why the un soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the french trucks br br by doing so they gave up the tutsi which is unforgivable of course br br but we must keep in mind that the french soldiers organized this situation
<START> unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie even if b mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min no sex no blood it's suppose to be about snuff no actors no dialogs just as bad as an 90't v film it's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi 3 robowar rats l'altro inferno virus cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco's spirit's new film pass on this one but if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun
<START> watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994 1997 spider man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out br br i'm from the old school where the 1967 spider man cartoon was the best and still remains the best i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible give me traditional villains please br br the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spider man no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon mini series made me wince dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc ock red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel blanc's son no way can he replicate his dad br br the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are br br the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious like the punisher but why the thing and iron man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you don't tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter's wedding that whole scenario was awful br br last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully ducked the thing's charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 that's why they can't have punching because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other what's wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff they've written out the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves br br kids enjoy these cartoons all you want i've seen enough br br 3 10 rating
<START> the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok br br in the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence br br anyway once his brother is killed 12 yr old arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brother's death allows him to hit on the kid's girlfriend arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son they really don't even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timer br br nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle's ex wife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family's turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening br br the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman's performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues 8 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's hippie mentality in a nut shell and bores us in the process its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups a naive young hippy played by the waif like kay lenz hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him if you think that is superficial the whole film encapsulates such scenes she keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade d
<START> this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face
<START> it's hard for me to assign the fair number of stars to this film but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was in 1968 an innovative approach to the war film remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969 but it did make a strong impression br br the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944 45 no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves there is no preaching no sentimentality no comic relief no complicated scenarios br br unfortunately there's no subtlety either partly because of their situation trying to stay alive the characters come across as flat familiar clichÃ©'s as entertainment the film doesn't make it though it was clearly not intended to entertain it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan both of which are far more watchable films here the flat and generally disagreeable characters the lack of an actual plot and the realistically unpleasant images including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history make the film hard to sit through though it is only 95 minutes br br so 10 stars for production and realism 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over a bonus star for having its heart in the right place average 8 br br like carl foreman's underrated the victors an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd why not both films have been on cable a number of times
<START> after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind dorothy malone finally said good bye to her sweet sister wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role malone won a best supporting actress oscar br br the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk's capable hands there's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson lauren bacall robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners br br domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama with the accent on the strong supporting players stack and malone both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack too should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives br br the nominal stars have less impressive work to do but do it with their usual skill and conviction hudson and bacall they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding br br the use of color is particularly striking as it usually is in a sirk film and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven br br well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast
<START> fantastic movie one to excite all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes' such as naomi watts julia cook ned kelly's lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe byrne ned's right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook watts to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides don't all aussies love an underdog
