<START> the idea had potential but the movie was poorly scripted poorly acted poorly shot and poorly edited there are lots of production flaws for example dr lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years wait for video but don't expect much
<START> i would rather of had my eyes gouged out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion there is no plot there is no acting ability ray liota has shamed himself and should be blacklisted from any more work i am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium br br rumor has it that maddona threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a stretcher actullly she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna be actor director i hope she stays in london and never returns to the usa please do not waste your money on this so called film i beg of you
<START> an absorbing although repetitive and rather didactic analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option but even here in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future that does not work and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with a simple act of charity gives some reward even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past br br although there is little actual on screen violence this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression politically and personally that does not make for easy entertainment clearly based on a play with a small cast a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience
<START> i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin schwartz's scary stories books according to that story the wendigo after calling your name in the wind drags you along and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea br br the movie wendigo doesn't it basically consists of every horror flick clichÃ© family moves to new house and strange things start happening anyone who harms them is asking for it and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy i've seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to count br br anyway avoid it patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan dewey on malcolm in the middle have done far better than this
<START> now i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like ftagn yog sototh could possibly lead to any good br br the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out as prisons go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things it also moves rather slowly which may bore people but other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing sartre's hell is other people with a lovecraft barker type of story and doing rather successfully br br bottom line take the time to watch this that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it lessons to be learned yog is bad almost as bad as french women
<START> absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality it has camp councellor angela pamela anderson awful as the killer her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior we run the gamut of boring clichÃ©d killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy clawed glove a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets drilled one who gets shoved into the crapper filled with leeches one who is roasted etc br br it doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time that is unless you want to see valerie hartmen's who plays the slut ally tits most of the violence occurs off screen so even that will not satisfy
<START> i hadn't heard about brashear before i watched this this is the story of him and the man who trained him helping him to become the first african american us navy diver a tale of will power the plot is well written and develops nicely throughout this is what it seems the typical underdog thing and it doesn't hold too many surprises it's also quite hollywood but hey i don't know the actual man maybe it's close to how it actually happened nevertheless it gets the job done with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way and this is inspirational for anyone who's ever heard the words no you can't be spoken about their life long dream the acting performances are all excellent deniro and gooding jr both shine whenever they're on screen rapaport is marvelous as well the characters are well written credible and consistent this is well edited and features good cinematography the production values are high and this does a fairly convincing job of transporting us back to the 50's this is the only film i've seen by this director and the writer though i may now consider looking into more they're responsible for there is a moderate amount of strong language otherwise no offensive material i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting and or fans of those who made it 7 10
<START> if you like to see animals being skinned alive their heads smashed dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them then this one is for you but if you are somewhat normal and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty pass this one up this movie tries to shock the viewer and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning and the killing of babies in the movie fake at least its was enough to make myself turn it off i've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage btk movie and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know its just make up and special effects so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals its not what we rented the movie for if anything there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won t be surprised by it as a very hardcore horror fan this one turned my stomach the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked
<START> this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don't just happen on the front br br luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great grandparents grandparents or parents went through during a war this film i think is a small thank you peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be it's definitely worth listening to him recite high flight and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare
<START> this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark and continues it throughout the movie i cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed br br the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7 9 on imdb i think it should be in 250 lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb great movie site
<START> in my opinion this movie advances no new thought seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side the director seems to have an agenda duh i find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view i for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man woman on the street really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000 years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs i'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the cristian faith i for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate
<START> theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture civilization and artistic expression in this compelling intellectual masterpiece jonathan r betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century such as francis ford copola martin scorcese orson welles and roman polanski the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by spielberg look trite and elementary at the time of it's release theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film making to levels never anticipated by film makers the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed thrilling detective novel co staring a talking dinosaur with a post modern name such as theodore and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say you are my most beloved creation this is one of the few films that is simply to die for
<START> when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's you know something is going to go right drew barrymore patrick highsmith leslie hope and sally kellerman are excellent actors the fbi agent was a terrible actor the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier those was just weird drew barrymore is very hot intimate strangers where sally kellerman worked was a great part the weird gummy worm was just weird nathan was a very handsome cat but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr gooding attacked him and the scene with dr wallace what was he doing fumbling around in there and not every male has a female as sally kellerman stated and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's that was weird
<START> scary movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments it all begins when roving reporter cindy campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps she soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe threatening developments including alien invaders killer videotapes freaky crop circles and much more faced with conspiracies of massive proportions and a crew of very strange people following her around cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again the plot is a non issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less this time around they focus on signs the ring matrix reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones the first one was imo one of the funniest films i have ever seen the second one wasn't as good but still quite funny the third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special let's just say that i didn't mind seeing it once but i probably wouldn't want to see it again the jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve charlie sheen the lame ones usually involve anthony anderson as he is very overrated why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny anna faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated simon rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad regina hall also returns as brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance the rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos jenny mccarthy and pamela anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos their in the opening sequence spoofing the ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film denise richards queen latifah camryn manheim and many others also have cameos david zucker directs and while this isn't another airplane it's also not another my boss's daughter either its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not like i said before if you do like it you probably won't really like it that much in the end i found it a bit disappointing as the pg 13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed rating 6 3 10
<START> i'll give credit where credit is due and say that linda fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard drinking actress who does what she wants she's brash sassy hard edged and very sexy she is much better than this film deserves br br but that is it this dull suspense film is a fragmented mess attempting at once to be a stalker thriller a murder thriller a tale of loyalty and betrayal and a steamy erotic thriller the film my friends isn't thrilling in the slightest br br for instance who thought of casting c thomas howell as a desirable leading man he is not ugly but for crying out loud it looks as though fiorentino's tough cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role br br the script is by far the worst aspect of the film there is no tension as fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film there is no sense of liberation as fiorentino gets wimpy howell to lose his inhibitions br br look for interesting but poorly done cameos by adam ant and issac hayes and one really really good sex scene between howell and fiorentino besides that my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else
<START> ok this movie was cool i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard blow off the dust and pop it in enjoyable all the way until the end but a great concept this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy judgment is victory for robot jox
<START> escaping the life of being pimped by her father and the speakeasy waitressing who dies in an explosion lily powers barbara stanwyck who is simply ravishing sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father in law and lily's new lover the sky's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands newly appointed president to the bank courtland trenholm george brent sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love this makes lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way though circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches trenholm now her husband is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing br br stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish being set in the pre code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily's dead heart that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him
<START> i have to say that sometimes looks are all that matters just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out not about our earth though but he is right anyway br br and when it comes to looks this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see br br and then there's the personality of the movie as well interesting with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images br br the movie probably won't affect your lifestyle ruining these beauties but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is br br this movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
<START> this movie has a special way of telling the story at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening br br anyway the story line was although simple but still very real and touching you met someone the first time you fell in love completely but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony who hasn't go through this but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life br br i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters i just wish that the story could be a happy ending
<START> i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me br br if you want a total b movie this is a good pick but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size
