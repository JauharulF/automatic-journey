<START> i expected alot from this movie kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie i can't even explain this movie it had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes tidal waves and earthquakes but that was at the end the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings the whole movie is missleading and boring one of lees worst
<START> as a huge fan or the cracker series i have been waiting 7 years for the next addition this episode i'm afraid just does not live up to the legend br br fitz returns to manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in northern irland goes on a killing spree br br what i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer it is all fat to far fetched br br there are however some good scenes in flash backs from northern irland which are filmed great
<START> i loved this movie for two reasons 1 jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt and is absolutely adorable 2 the movie helped to inspire a role playing game i thoroughly enjoy mage the awakening i've shown it at various larp after parties and it's always a big hit br br d d love and jeff squeeing aside it's not exactly a masterpiece but it's well done and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
<START> no strings attached features carlos mencia doing stand up that makes us both laugh and think not only does he poke fun at racial issues like many haters claim but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally why americans are crazier than arab terrorists why nobody needs to pray for the pope and what he hopes he's doing in heaven a theory of how easter aka big ups to jesus day traditions got started his viewing of the movie passion of the christ and his sub sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he's affected by jesus how society should treat the physically handicapped and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not br br also he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice so we should use it to speak the truth say what we think and not be afraid if others are offended br br carlos is the bomb
<START> one reason pixar has endured so well and been so successful is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics they have a story to match their style and often very moving style at that affecting charming and cross generational that a lot anime speaking in broad terms and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is i think and i might be wrong partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous so enervating that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story br br that same cannot be said of renaissance there are flaws in its plot but i'll get to that later those same flaws however are not reflected in the visuals renaissance is nowt short of stunning the ultra high contrast images sometimes so high contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible and incredible detail are always impressive always a joy to behold the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world dark murky quite affluent and even clean but shrouded in intrigue corporate malfeasance obsessed with beauty capital of the catwalk after all and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental sophisticated architecture br br it's a compelling environment not entirely original but great all the same the film's much touted 'motion capture' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a black and white photographer would die for not that the detail prevents entertainment because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences a hell for leather care chase a couple of gruesome ly imaginative murders several tussles in the dark and a nasty dust up in a gloomy apartment the locations are great too i want to visit the nightclub while the central character of karas is your regular off the shelf maverick cop the other two female characters who are sisters are the real motors of the movie coming from war torn eastern europe products of a war diaspora and a family spat they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole br br the film is tremendously atmospheric its dizzying swooping faux camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience however the plot it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev a drop dead gorgeous and pioneering scientist after she's snatched from the street the sinister corporation avalon is any corporation ever not sinister which she was working for on 'classified' projects are hell bent on her retrieval and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands dead bodies cigarette smoke and narrowly missed bullets and falling in love with ilona's sister bislane very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack as he plumbs the depths of the city's sordid underbelly and his own past br br text book noir in other words but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city to which it bears a passing visual resemblance the plot and resolution are dull the theme of immortality being raised but never examined and the shenanigans of high rolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension the basic ideas are familiar sci fi genre materials and there's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material br br however the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry but it's the projection of life in paris circa 2054 the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold i may be taking it too seriously and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made extremely entertaining and pretty mature too and with an ambiance like no other
<START> fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again and maybe again
<START> dick tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date the movie has the same feel as the comic book staying true to the color scheme the batman series has climbed fallen climbed and fallen again dick tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy the good guys triumph over evil without blood and gore to get the point across al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy caprice and madonna is memorable as breathless but the best job by far is warren beatty who just epitomizes dick tracy just as he did with clyde barrows i can't wait until it comes out on dvd on april 2 2002 my tape is wearing thin
<START> well what are the odds at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster's egg that has been lying there Â for over a thousand years i suppose the crater lake monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest yes this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing but it's also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it half of the film Â at least Â revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait it is mostly during their prototypic laurel hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake steve hanson the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case but only if he's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process this textbook wtf moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in new york city or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and there's an exhilarating chase through the woods ending in the dino's hungry muzzle the absurd little details in the crater lake monster are too numerous to mention for example this is probably the only creature feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as i'm concerned it's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight Â all during one and the same diurnal course the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since it's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects the cute critter is a plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator crater lake monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that i can only encourage to track down the miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle and because basically this is a very bad film should be put into perspective because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value
<START> darcy and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her mum's boyfriend peter left his doctor's position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn although this inn has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl's who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house they called her the 'tooth fairy' as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth this work on the inn has awoken the 'tooth fairy' now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits pamela br br this flick's old folk myth of the 'tooth fairy' doesn't paint her in a very generous way as you would believe when you were a child don't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares another one which did fall into the same category was darkness falls 2003 i can't compare how similar they are in the premises because i haven't seen the latter but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea for a little straight to dvd film this dtv effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device low expectations are needed as i wouldn't class it as an success but i found it be to marginally entertaining br br cory strode and cookie rae brown's story or background for this 'tooth fairy' character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural silly is a good way to describe what's happening in this poorly scripted story but it never really feels like a fairytale horror the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded while the acting is simply sub par with the bland characters they have to work off but director chuck bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense the zero scares and generic tone his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography the promising opening scene is creepily effective his pacing can slow up in parts and there's the odd and unnecessary slow motion scene put in but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn't bored br br the make up special effects provided the goods as there's enough repulsive gruel and the tooth fairy's appearance is especially gooey the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black robe bubbling make up and swift movements being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness child actors can be incredibly annoying but nicole muÃ±oz was decent in her part lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid but can be a little too causal in their performances as peter and darcey the radiantly gorgeous carrie anne fleming is one of their lodgers p j soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn br br i thought it was a okay time waster that has a sound concept which just isn't fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff watchable nonsense but at the same time extremely forgettable
<START> if fassbinder has made a worse film i sure don't want to see it anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like the bitter tears of petra von kant this film bogs down with so much arty quasi symbolic images it looks like a parody of an art film the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira's prostitute friend channel surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex wife and or her daughter these are the only moments that display any real human emotion and prove that at the core of this horrible film there was an excellent film struggling to free itself what a waste
<START> of all the football films i have watched this is one of the 2 best the other being fever pitch but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup diego maradona this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time br br the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic this story is not about the individual games of the world cup rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself br br exciting games like france v brazil one of the greatest games of all time were covered in the same vein the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein highly recommended a classic of world football to be watched over and over again esp if you're a maradona fan
<START> this is one of my all time favorites it is so simple and sweet definitely a chick flick romantic comedy i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters are you thinking what i'm thinking and ed says now what are the odds of that happening in my opinion a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it and with this one you can i also really enjoyed walter m s way of portraying einstein i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel good romantic comedy now and then
<START> carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids when she finds herself overloaded at work she is able to hire paul to help her out paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistake br br the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't a sort of point of hear like point of view the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow and or stretched credibility a bit there is also some unpleasant violence back to the positive side the cinematography was very good br br the film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4 28 2002
<START> ok first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time iÂ´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable tv horror film with some well made scenes but when youÂ´re nine you just donÂ´t care about those facts this scared the hell out of me back then especially those aforementioned zelda scenes and they still do nowadays iÂ´m kind of hooked to this film i have to see this maybe once in a month and on every new yearÂ´s eve i watch this with a 12 pack of beer bunch of friends itÂ´s like an appetizer for a good party i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like but one canÂ´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which the creeds underact what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary and i donÂ´t mean the zombie stuff here the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind honestly how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable tv one but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror chillers out there alright i busted some of the castÂ´s balls a minute ago but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary i really would love to know and i donÂ´t mean night of the living dead here this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff
<START> this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he'll try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain and is signed br br if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morris's story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the man's relationships ring true br br inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out
<START> if you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex this film is for you on the plus side the lead actor actress newcomer transsexual does have an interesting screen presence but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie if that essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts transexual prostitute male hustler and russian gay immigrant who somehow have developed a bond why is not clear we are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street right and anna nicole smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy the filmmaker shows a gritty unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life quite a fantasy but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side in sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here unless of course you just like to revel in the kink
<START> went to watch this movie expecting a 'nothing really much' action flick still got very disappointed the opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy it keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in well nothing of that sort happens the movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed wonder what was the director thinking made no sense watsoever the movie lacked in all aspects had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow even if rambo was in it i don't think he could have helped the rating at all there is simply no logic to the movie a perfect way to waste your time and money by far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them
<START> okay i've watched this movie twice now i have researched it heavily on the net i have asked several people on there opinions i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic 'carmilla' a book that this movie is supposed to be based on i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the book br br laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the 'general' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with laura's condition and the general br br i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i can't be bothered with that it's called the this movie doesn't make any sense game br br all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening i mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete br br it will have to answer such questions as br br why can vampires walk around in day light br br why are they all lesbians br br why is a girl called bob and why does she shoot herself br br when is the movie a dream and when is it real br br why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn't make anyone bat an eyelid br br why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie too br br and why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car br br and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car br br what the hell is the asylum scene all about br br what the hell is the green goo all about br br why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse br br why are there never any vampires fighting zombies br br what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know that br br in fact sod it it's just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too br br i have my plot and i have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effort br br in conclusion br br 'vampires vs zombies' has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on
<START> highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star i could gaze at her for quite some time to michelle pfeiffer i could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy boy air pirate to perfection charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other mark strong jason flemyng and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death loved this whole thread as well peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes nice feet but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works
<START> this film is predictable it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass when he huts the ball for the jets one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film the politics reminds me when i was back east many people know when the fix is in i gave this four because of the acting but the story is lame
