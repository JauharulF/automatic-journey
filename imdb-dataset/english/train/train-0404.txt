<START> supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970's nightmare is full of bad southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly disguised babe in prison movie especially in its uncut original version nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors in particular does a good job of making viewers hate him even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes there's also a change of pace role for the late robert reed who appears as the lecherous warden and tina louise previously ginger of gilligan's island made a rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade d br br
<START> the straight story is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged dying brother but that's just the basic synapsis this movie is about so much more than that this was richard's farnworth's last role before he died and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for he's a stubborn old man not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know br br the straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives it will reach down and touch some part of you at least if you have a heart it will
<START> psychotic transsexual bobbi murders the patient angie dickinson of a prominent doctor michael caine and then pursues the high priced prostitute nancy allen who caught a glimpse of bobbi in the elevator liz allen comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son keith gordon to catch the killer br br it can be summed up in a couple of words it's very sexy dickinson and allen look great it's very bloody with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies and boy is it well crafted writer director de palma's script is ok but it really takes a backseat to the man's film making abilities it is highly successful on a visceral level and i actually get involved interested with these characters i can notice the standard de palma homages to ripoffs of hitchcock at least from one of the master's pictures br br and to top it all off it has a professional and believable cast br br this was de palma's third movie with ex wife nancy allen after carrie and home movies br br by the way dancer turned actress rachel ticotin was one of the production assistants there's a bit of trivia for you br br i wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off br br one of the best things about it is a typically striking pino donaggio music score br br 8 10
<START> terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea br br rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it's the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the floor br br an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action br br raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired br br martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him br br by the film's end you don't know why the girl was murdered don't even bother to ask

<START> for starters i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet i have not once seen it on tv before in my country and a lot of people do not usually know about this show it is a pity though because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years br br i don't hand out 10 points a lot but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids show though when the complete story unfolds itself you know that this is a real deep storyline with a spiritual message this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit animals a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows br br the overall design is also something very different at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show as he also drew that segment in the comic br br if you are looking for a mind twisting show a show that takes on various subjects such as reality suicide spirituality life then this is something you should not miss once you begin watching you are probably going to watch it to the end one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic but this is not too annoying the only question remains though where is the dvd
<START> i'll make this short and sweet this movie sucked br br i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever gave it 9 out of 10 stars so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels i was wrong this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one it had the plot continue and thats it it was like bad outtakes from part one or something br br i love walken but i felt sorry for him here i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film but don't blink you'll miss him there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don't like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals however it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry he's one of the funniest people on earth br br this movie will make you like the first one a little less so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself being a fan of part 1 i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crap br br the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film fast forward or skip to that if you can't stomach the first part br br 1 out of 10 stars this was awful
<START> 10 items or less was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer director brad silberling just a little film shot in carson ca that feels like the entire story was improvised in the best sense of the word silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman in between his big projects with spanish actress paz vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other br br morgan freeman plays himself yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things his 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson where he encounters among others one scarlet the girl at the argumentative 10 items or less checkout line not only is scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her philandering husband bobby cannavale currently sleeping with scarlet's lazy co worker anne dudek and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere the two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other br br it is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well this is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message it is well worth viewing and this is a dvd that has featurettes that are touching informative and comic a pleasure to view grady harp
<START> you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclerc son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role br br the plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him br br not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations br br i strongly recommend it 9 5 10
<START> this film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy while i found that world morally repulsive the film did best what storytelling should do and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never undergo tim meadows so convincingly portrays leon phelps and the story so drew me into the reckless world of leon that i momentarily forgot that i was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it herein lies the film's undoing because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface and reject that story i hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that i loved it i loved it not only for its fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality besides it's just funny
<START> i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little shaken by all that i just saw i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che's death for me it clouded the entire movie i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel the slowly evolving inevitability of his death part two was so downbeat compared to again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative the politics of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where that official questions che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict argentine versus bolivian i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried i guess it is all in the timing is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement in bolivia there wasn't che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film if not now when 50 years from now a very thought provoking and well done film make every effort to see it
<START> i'll tell you what happened some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on tv did we really need a big screen re make did they ask the fans i wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of rocky horror picture show with actors like ashton krutcher steve martin britney spears and kiefer southerland took out all the music and made it a drama do you think they would like that this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had sure the original was a bit corny at times but bo and luke were always nice they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble and their main objective was to help people that passed through town none of that mattered to the people that made this film they might have never even seen the original show all the way through my big question is what will they ruin next
<START> sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content i don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to quincy jones' days like these just might bring a tear to your eye enjoy it
<START> one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not very strange if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out
<START> i'm sorry but even tj hooker's adrian zmed couldn't save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington i'd hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopeds br br i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunky australian boy can't fit into outsiders dominated school ergo goes for tough guy with stupid biker helmet look it was disney story gone horribly awry br br so it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
<START> return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the western's clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days br br this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era br br act one sets up the premise workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times br br act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mr miyagi's style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way br br act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for
<START> badly directed garbage a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it doesn't make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one i can see why people dislike uwe boll we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates horror films can be full of desolation they can be miniature works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on seed is just really really poor
<START> the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street smart intelligent world weary character she doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of although used to covering up for her boss' indiscretions
<START> one of the comedies of the 1970's also has the best signature tune of any comedy show the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing a man and two women richard o' sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success br br the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements
