<START> in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh br br les visiteurs has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about zemeckis's back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel br br nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs the first and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money br br the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought explanation it's no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that's only one of many holes poirÃ© tries to avoid and fails br br let's have a look at the characters montmirail doesn't change he's just a little more boring regarding frenegonde that's another story valÃ©rie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and poirÃ© doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy br br forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times br br the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old
<START> let's get some things straight first zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them walk run hell even fly if he wants to that's what makes this original zombie movie so good everything they did was so damn original i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not decaying corpses since they just freaking died they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it i'm glad i listened they are always right when it comes to real horror fan's tastes 10 out of 10 go rent it
<START> you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind being mr harlin's first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff imo it's definitely worth it
<START> this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it really really cute and funny not realistic but not suppose to be the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is sadly an over looked classic film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages too bad we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is unsinkable a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons she is funny and charming she stole the show
<START> i didn't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much don't get my wrong its not a bad short film tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though i don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do i say go for it the gag reel was fun i won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also done by jagged edge i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven
<START> on mtv cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie scarface out of their dvd collection this may give you an idea that scarface is a gangster movie sure there are gangsters and mobs in it but that's not the point of scarface tony montana al pacino is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life he falls in with the mob group and becomes a well known drug lord montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life the classic phrase say hello to my little friend is in scarface this quote is what always comes to mind when i think about brian depalmas movie scarface this falls under my top 10 favorite movies i would rate it 1 2 out of definitely a movie you must see phenomenal
<START> if you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot watch dream quest on the one hand you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it on the other hand it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together these people simply cannot act and the story is unfortunately lame to a ridiculous degree br br still i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners also i'd like to see more attempts like this one maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot
<START> i'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films with jedi menace clowns and sith we have the death of lucas' career he wants us to swallow the annakin is vader nonsense i never believed it was true this film vindicates those feelings the story hasn't worked since phantom moron and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade i have to go i know where some new rocks to throw are you want spoilers here they come luke and leia are not related vader is not their father duke countoo should have switched sides while he still could yoda has less verbal skills than yogi berra his advice has never been any good to anybody obi wan lied to luke for the first two films annakin didn't build c3p0 he found him in the desert and lied to his mom about putting him together from scratch chewbacca has fleas this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b h amma lamma ding dong if she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of annie but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her what a dope
<START> if you r in mood for fun and want to just relax and enjoy bade miyan chote miyan is one of the movies to watch amitabh started off pretty good but it is govinda who steals the show from his hands awesome timing for and good dialog delivery its inspired from bad boys but it has indian masala to it people think it might be confusing and stupid but the fact that david dhavan is directing and govinda is acting should not raise any questions other recommended movies in the same genre david dhavan govinda combo are shola aur shabnam aankhen raja babu saajan chale sasural deewana mastana collie no 1 jodi no 1 hero no 1 haseena manjayegi ek aur ek gyarah
<START> this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show
<START> usually i don't think hollywood productions are fit to be called film so i call them 'movies' instead but this piece of elephant manure is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the title br br where shall i start 1 if this isn't the start of geriatric casting it sure is the epitome of it stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age she's supposed to play an 18 year old and she is forty effing two br br 2 a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france where we see clichÃ© characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother ex queen of models etc this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy br br 3 it's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about that br br 4 the horrible accents br br 5 the nana mouskouri elevator music br br i could go on but i think this is enough and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations i mean br br i invite everyone to add to my list p d
<START> sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival a scion of the genji clan the film making has the main hallmarks of a low budget production including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages the kind you might find in an under produced dorama the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards gojoe bridge at night but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time but which could earn him enlightenment br br there's no absence of ambitiousness however in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film making style br br a disappointment
<START> come on people this movie is better than 4 i can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this and it was funny br br i watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes watch this one
<START> in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe his girlfriend beth dorie barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she's institutionalized a year later she's out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful condo in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again br br lousy slasher thriller a textbook example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there's one real gruesome one but that's not till the end br br with a few exceptions the acting sucks dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job br br logic lapses abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one
<START> this film was the worst film i have ever viewed it was like a homework assignment for a film class it totally misses the mark when it comes to the message it is trying to relay characters are over exaggerated poor acting and as for a plot well it is utterly ridiculous the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film the co actor is handsome and that's about it moral of this movie never judge a movie by it's cover save your time money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it
<START> this british spanish co production is one of the countless films shot in spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the italian spaghetti westerns and as is typical of such genre efforts features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars robert shaw telly savalas stella stevens martin landau fernando rey michael craig al lettieri dudley sutton antonio mayans etc ironically however this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most american of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically or is that officially extinct br br i really wanted to like this film not only because the western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities including an intriguing premise to be a good one not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of a town called bastard's novelization following its original release as it is the film's sole virtue if indeed it can even be called that is its sheer eccentricity for instance stevens playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband sleeps inside a coffin driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant sutton savalas as a blood thirsty renegade who at first appears to be the film's main villain is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman lettieri very early on in the picture the villain of the piece then turns out to be landau who in the film's very first scene is seen pillaging side by side our legendary hero turned priest shaw fernando rey playing a blind peasant is the only one who can identify rebel shaw who in the end turns out to have been merely a front for well nevermind as you can see the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there the production team responsible for this film were also behind other western fare around the same period of time like custer of the west 1967 bad man's river 1971 captain apache 1971 and pancho villa 1972
<START> wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie 10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies guess its in demand
<START> i really really love this show i have always liked the 1990's shows of space ghost this show was hilarious and i can't believe why cartoon network's adult swim would take such a funny show like this off the air i hope they put this show on dvd or something the show is about brak from the space ghost cartoons sgcc and cartoon planet who lives his every day life with his mom and dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot zorak my favorite episodes were the one where zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that zorak made from singing at all another episode i like is the one where brak and zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from sunday to friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist another episode i like is the one where brak's dad and their next door neighbor thundercleese the robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm another episode i liked was the one where zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand i also like a lot of the other episodes one thing that never fails to make me laugh is when zorak is getting beaten up blasted and zapped
<START> i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn't even get to the end of the program every minute i had watched this program my i q must of dropped about 10 points this is basically like a children's program but with swearing not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded disappointing horribly acted program sarah silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons
<START> the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building 2 when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height br br i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us br br ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9 11 so i'll never forget what this country went through i believe if i remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral
