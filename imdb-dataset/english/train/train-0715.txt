<START> ok now lets see what was funny in the first movie i know people with funny accents people falling into the water silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max no good a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons no good boatcrash check funny comments between the two teams they tried but failed also there are too may personalities they are following in this movie this film should be about what is happening on the water not on land i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max no good all in all i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts
<START> the part of the grinch was made for jim carrey and i was extremely impressed with his performance not being a great fan of his i was apprehensive but pleasantly surprised with the outcome taylor momsen as cindy lou who was the cutest little girl i have seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills i was even drawn to tears at one point i've never read the dr seuss book of the tale so i didnt know what to expect the humour was quite dark overall i enjoyed the film apart from the songs and would recommend it for family viewing especially
<START> forget credibility br br you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons especially when renny harlin is directing br br cliffhanger is no exception but the movie has numerous assets breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed stunning special and visual effects the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film excellent musical score welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension and a solid cast two heroes stallone star and cowriter has the lion's share of the footage but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground a charming heroin janine turner and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall but also rex linn in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it leon craig fairbrass good solid entertainment then if no credibility as roger ebert wrote about another film it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much br br
<START> in all my years of film going only once have i walked out on a film and that was the dreadful stay tuned fortunately the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see buffy the vampire slayer instead a minor improvement that film is gone with the wind compared to dick a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it let alone laugh with it br br granted paying to see a movie with a title like dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast daniel hedaya bruce mccullough dave foley kristen dunst etc etc and a premise that at least promised something fresh what the film delivered was as portended four woefully predictable dick jokes comic timing suffering from jetlag and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes in short it was the watergate scene from forrest gump stretched nay laid on a rack and mangled over 90 excruciating minutes br br as soon as you understand that the two main characters airless insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly will participate in every major watergate event you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses 18 and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes check the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein check john dean getting a change of heart and testifying check the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laugh getting to boot and though it posits to be an amusing re deconstruction of the events leading to president nixon's resignation it turns into a paint by the numbers choose your own adventure fill in the blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less br br even the film's strong point the aforementioned cast is bewilderingly unproductive here the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g gordon liddy trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and strait jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay shearer mumbles a few lines tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows then disappears dave foley one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall two others bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this film ah the blessings of nepotism fares badly as well his h r haldeman occasionally lends a much need lightening of the funeral plot but the funniest thing about him is the buzz cut he sports perhaps the films funniest bit of all and then there's daniel hedaya as richard nixon oops i mean dick ha ha how amusingly funny he manages to play a solid nixon avoiding the pitfalls such as overdone make up rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins while preserving the essence the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness i seem to be forgetting someone oh yes the two stars of the film those over bubbly teenagers can't remember their names perhaps because i have repressed their performances nothing could be farther from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of hyperactive and super hyperactive with an occasional pouty tossed in br br this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the me decade but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot a kind of extra plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing br br the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan o'brien this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this the writers and producers will be far from the cameras gaze possibly cooking up another disaster such as this br br
<START> br br this movie not a film clearly recorded on a cheap cam corder may be one of the greatest cinematic stink bombs in history beware the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex addiction the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own warts the script is pointless and meandering with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are lame lame lame except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut and comically overwrought br br if you are looking for a decent film you don't want this if you are looking for a titillating sex flick you don't want this whatever your life's goals desires or perspectives you do not want to watch this movie how they got rosanna arquette natashia kinski and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme
<START> i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film it's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity it's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college
<START> all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you're looking for something that's funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog
<START> i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white educated and urban the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african americans and it made the difference in audience reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country basically the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits and there are many because they'd be laughting at blacks while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites br br i on the other hand being asian and thus belonging to neither group had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos trappings values pseudo philosophies the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed the songs are too funny to be believed br br this film is one of the best pseudo documentaries to come along including a mighty wind
<START> let's cut to the chase if you're a baby boomer you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that in 1976 mccartney had the gumption to drop in on john's city hermit life and spend the day with him you also certainly wondered how things went i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard from john's and paul's perspective and i admit that i reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does but none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does i found it amazingly lifelike perfectly plausible and 100 saccharin free now can anyone explain why i didn't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night i mean it's already three years old for goodness sake and yes if you're a beatles fan this is a must see performance even the subtle paraphrasing of beatles' melodies in the background is inspired
<START> one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i wouldn't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you're watching a small group of middle aged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep fest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it's the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics 50 movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack you'll realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror
<START> this is my second time through for a perfect spy i watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it i like it still it's natural that it gets compared to the beeb's other big le carre' series tinker tailor soldier spy tinker tailor focuses on the game spies play perfect spy gives us the other axis what kind of person a spy is there are a number of themes that these movies share along with others in the genre br br ambiguity moral sexual interpersonal which creates a multidimensional space of true vs false inside vs outside love vs responsibility in a way these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect backstabbed in its various nuances br br the theme of fathers and father figures is also important one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick the main character magnus' perhaps ersatz father throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he's been toppled who seems impervious to what others think of him asks magnus each time they meet do you love your old man and never do you love me maybe it says this somewhere else but a perfect spy is a love story br br another theme is that of malignancy the nature of the business is to turn others turn them against their government against their friends and associates turn them against their values and beliefs in each of the le carre' movies i have seen the spy who came in from the cold looking glass war tinker tailor soldier spy smiley's people and a perfect spy turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy br br finally not so much a theme as an artistic touch in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot or perhaps two shots bookending the story violence torture cruelty are always just beneath the surface we see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects le carre''s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass br br if you haven't seen the films above and you enjoy a perfect spy you are in for a treat i'd also recommend the sandbagger series yorkshire tv the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity the ipcress file and burial in berlin are nice though light weight for political intrigue try a very british coup house of cards and yes minister yes prime minister br br if only a brit would set his hand to making the three kingdoms there would be a film with intrigue and complexity
<START> when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very wary of what the movie was about in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i trashed the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr this tore me apart slave labour really sucks believe me but i had to do it chores all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding neno well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating it's doing pretty good
<START> being from the philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history this film provides an excellent vintage view of philadelphia in the 1940s there are scenes of downtown a train station that no longer exists 30th street station which still does exist as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city good shots of the old row homes as they appeared then the movie gets a bit chatty at times causing the viewer to briefly lose interest but the overall storyline is solid and very moving anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film bright victory also with local footage of the valley forge army hospital in phoenixville pa and scenes from downtown phoenixville the army hospital has since become a college campus neither of these films are out on any format and i can't imagine why i have them both on vhs from home recording as shown on tcm in recent years i highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area
<START> the stock market crash of 1929 and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front br br in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on br br footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films he wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had br br of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason but it's so creative and fun to watch br br dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade ah the moon is here honeymoon hotel and by a waterfall the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade shanghai lil br br joan blondell is cagney's no nonsense girl friday at the theater like in blonde crazy she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones one of blondell's best screen roles br br look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number and in a scene at the beginning of the film producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne the duke's voice is unmistakable but what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there i've got to believe that clip was deliberate br br footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best
<START> this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this
<START> a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly talented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin's instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esther's pain we never feel a victory in phoenix's talent
<START> i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try and how surprised i was the story is different from any other dance movie i've seen lately with a deeper meaning than just winning it's touching and well written and well directed raya is such a strong character i love the fact that she never doubts herself she's so mature and focused and aware of her talent and what talent rutina wesley has my jaw dropped in the final dance scene the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is honestly inspiring also the fact that she's not the typical super hot chick see jessica alba briana evigan jenna dewan zoe seldana makes her really appealing and real seriously why is this movie rated so low you can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work really good actually i even cried at the end of the movie and the dancing routines are just sick
<START> there are a number of things that are not correct although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when is still in dispute the most blatant liberty with the facts i think is when they start to play at bruno koschmidder's kaiserkeller when in fact they played at the indra and moved to the kaiserkeller later br br i agree with semprinni20 that the film was biased in favour of pete best's version but if he is the story consultant then i guess he calls the shots i also agree with semprinni that the recordings pete best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was fired br br although the film is not such a lavish production as the later film backbeat i prefer this film because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterisation br br there is plenty in the film that is quite substantial such as brian epstein trying to hide the fact that he has been queer bashed only to find out that the band knew he was gay all along little touches like the band going into a cafÃ© and ordering corn flakes mit milch my favourite scene which does have some bassis in fact is where at an audition stuart sutcliffe has just bought his bass guitar but can't play it so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries faking it but gets caught that's rock 'n' roll br br well worth watching
<START> let's be honest as a film school project made without budget and real actors this is a passably interesting film as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer it's a very poorly produced product if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product i e a film i feel deeply disappointed it's a videotaped tv play something along the line of old sixties serials but without that certain charm aside from the leading man mr redfield who also is the director the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus a bit too old for that actually or members of the director's household who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches but also the make up artist or hairdresser a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s it's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small bare studio sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion the film attempts to be dreamlike whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me the standards weren't too high to start with there are interesting dialogs every now and then but overall it's pretty lame and two dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew that's how artsy films attempted to look in the 80s mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director
<START> well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star cast i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who some pathetic songs that will be heard by who some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who race against time u mean waste against time ok so first you spoil your kid then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway
