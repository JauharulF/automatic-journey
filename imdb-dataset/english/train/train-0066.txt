<START> tarzan the ape man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to burroughs' literary character but while the 1932 tarzan was reduced to tarzan jane speech this tarzan played by miles o'keeffe doesn't speak or even grunt he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film br br no tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane or rather as third banana to bo derek's left breast and her right breast this movie has no point but to show derek naked br br the two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad more evidence that no one cared br br bizarrely enough tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film maybe he car pooled in from sumatra with the indian elephants that are also on display
<START> i don't quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice it's a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story it's hidden on lynch's website and well worth the search
<START> from a modern sensibility it's sometimes hard to watch older films it's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man especially such a shallow and inconstant man he's obviously a player i wouldn't trust him to stay true to her who doesn't want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after he's supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him i wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me br br apart from that subplot i did like the movie how can you not like sailors dancing with each other you can tell they were from san francisco d the rehearsal dance was great watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great the last dance scene face the music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful and i really enjoyed we saw the sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song br br anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals imo and the songs were ok but the dancing was worth watching the film for i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set br br it's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land
<START> directed by govind nihalani this is definite cop film of indian cinema may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds barred how it effects on a young cop a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop bad cop hindi films but this is different today's generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like 'satya' 'company' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar its more than cop character he internalized a lot which is something original in acting watch his scenes with his father whom he hates smita whom he loves smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level my god what a natural expressions she carried shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen sadashiv amrapurkar as 'rama shetty' it's another story that he didn't get such a meaty role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra's b grade action films watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by amrish puri next both are sharing wine together how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other two faces of indian police force masculinity impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satya Âkudos to nihalani's touch the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film best actor om puri 3 filmfare awards in best film best director best supporting actor categories br br recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films br br ratings 8 10
<START> cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie unfortunately that is not saying much br br it has a competent cast of second rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances it is efficiently directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot it looks ok but is ponderously over plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded br br for example the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many br br the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia nor is she br br julia's 'feminine intuition' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesn't similarly pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time br br these are just symptoms of the underlying problem the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn't as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know br br the ending is particularly lame julia is menaced purely by accident lisa has no reason to want to kill her she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done br br it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads then it occurred to me someone said those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko so why don't we make one like that br br cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people mysterious troubled shape shifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently frigid kills people arouses the suspicions of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end but 'modelled on' doesn't mean 'as good as' by a wide margin it copies but doesn't understand what it is copying br br it is obviously trying for the low key suggestive lewton style but this approach doesn't follow through into the story lisa is no irene she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york there is never any doubt about her purpose neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake br br then again during her nocturnal prowling we get not one but two attempts at 'buses' neither come off because the director doesn't understand what makes a 'bus' work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalked br br these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation br br plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time passer came out
<START> there's a group of fox tv executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission br br 'how about aiming for something like 24 or the west wing ' says one of them but they all agree it would be too expensive and cheap tv is less likely to harm the station if it flops br br 'well how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom ' offers another and is fired on the spot 'don't you know good writers cost lots of money ' the big chief barks 'that's why we invented reality tv ' br br 'we could do yet another crime drama ' suggests a man in a bland suit 'i'm listening ' the boss replies suddenly interested 'people like csi so let's do another copy of that ' blandman adds br br 'but there are already far too many csi clones out there what can we do to make ours stand out ' a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly 'stand out if we do that people may be confused let's give them more of what they already like ' the big chief screams br br 'let's just add more violence and make it really grisly we are fox after all ' another suit suggests to a hearty reply of 'now you're getting it' from the big chief 'we could make them the deviant crimes unit ' he goes on to add clearly on a roll br br 'by jove he's got it ' the big chief laughs 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen ' 'well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts ' blandman points out br br 'then it's settled we just need a name ' the big chief announces 'we could call it sex cops violence ' br br 'too literal how about killer instinctÂit conveys violence but sounds a bit like basic instinct which had lots of sex ' br br 'puuurfect' the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel arrested development
<START> well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame however as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly from the subtle gestures towards a joke to the blatant toilet humour throughout along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo this film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face let alone his poker underwear some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain br br i just goes to show that not only is trey parker adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film however i'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet here in the uk sort it out boys br br i am and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits and occasionally snorting into my lager all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear however i'm sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices
<START> turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of my boyfriend's back only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you're watching this it's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max we get a name like johnny every so often and this johnny has nowhere to go there isn't a specific reason to why our dead corpse crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night so that renders the movie totally useless without a feeling of sorrow his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead johnny takes a bite out of eddie's arm afterwards the viewer is asked a tough question why does the movie have to be this cornball there is an answer any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental living is a coincidence dead has nothing in common with the movie show this one to your girlfriend and she'll skip the senior prom turning your life into a deserted ruin blah
<START> do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation technically i am a boomer though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the '60s were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br this is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up
<START> above average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time a scent of pleasantville camp hangs around this flick as a period piece it's more accurate than not its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving chris cooper turns in a first class performance as howard's coal miner daddy
<START> painful painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was i pity you and your bored brain may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place
<START> four best friends young male chauvinist pigs with the emphasis on pigs meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable whipping although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story one of those one man band flix with a dozen producers whipped is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think the man show is emmy material
<START> canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross dressing and assorted farcical situations arise the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but rohmer's effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time
<START> left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars the acting is weak and uninspiring the story even weaker the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings and who can blame them however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking
<START> oh it's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for 1928 cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her poor past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies sees marion davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special it's got to be one of the first movie in the movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a must see if you ask me
<START> this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re naming it doesn't work at all firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong it's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end but there is also and that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all you can also see that in the very unsteady character development you almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one
<START> i really liked this movie i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers but not in this movie it is definitely worth renting
<START> hugh ed harris is a hotshot bachelor senator determined to run for president one day however he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie aggie diane keaton is an accomplished and award winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit hugh is smitten he convinces aggie to become his fiancÃ© but will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics where things are not always what they seem to be and will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz this is mostly a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view however although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality it doesn't completely succeed nevermind the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment
<START> rawhide was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor most episodes especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in rawhide was a true gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten thanks to eric fleming's performance the show became a massive hit of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors clint eastwood sheb wooley paul brinegar steve raines james murdoch rocky shahan robert cabal all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didn't work the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture rustlers indians commancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through the reason eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body the gritty realism was gone gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting we shall not see his like again watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint
<START> haven't seen any of the japanese grudge films but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from grudge maybe because i didn't expect anything at all when i watched it i didn't expect getting scared i didn't know anything about it either that was probably a good thing br br this is a film that you apparently either love or hate most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge films but even though i haven't seen them i believe it isn't right to compare any film actually this film stands on it its own br br the story is weak most people say i don't agree the story is minimalistic and done so on purpose the story telling techniques used the broken time frame for instance is perfectly done the director knows exactly what he's doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it br br i gave this film 8 of 10 it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate it's as simple as that
