<START> alexandr sascha luzhin john turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy hosted tournament his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life natalia emily watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera geraldine james to scope out possible marriage partners vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia oh and can he become the chess champion also this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well as for the look of the film it could not be better the scenery is of the put your eye out variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate then too the ending is bittersweet however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation don't miss this one you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms
<START> okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg's close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps it's an intellectual philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john 'bud' cardos of kingdom of the spiders and writer david schmoeller of tourist trap must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as it's got papier mÃ¢chÃ© dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headache inducing light laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voice over introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as it's all gibberish did you know that the definition of 'time' isn't what we all think it is time doesn't necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar powered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is Â incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy's husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing br br grandpa you know what this is don't you this is a time space warp br br stevie i'm not quite sure if i know what that means dad br br grandpa well i guess nobody really does br br make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or don't you and stop talking about the vortex like you're some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and not worth bothering for fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly
<START> frailty is a non gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion obsession straight into depravity dad we never learn his name is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son adam the family's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them god has given him a vision and what a vision Â the entire family's job is to destroy demons who of course are disguised in human form br br proceeding from this premise the movie is unflinching in following it dad kidnaps people demons whom god has told him to destroy binds them lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil then kills them Â while making his young sons watch fenton the older boy is horrified seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer adam the younger is uncomfortable but trusts that dad is following god's will eventually dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the demons that god has put on dad's list and finally invites them to fully participate in god's mission for the family br br this is not you understand an abusive father he loves his children he is only following god's instructions this is our job now son we've got to do this when fenton terrified and convinced his father has gone mad says he'll report him to the police his father explains if you do that son i'll die the angel was clear on this the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic and warps their entire lives 1 the movie's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects a story in flashback told in a police station to a fbi agent the moody lighting the stormy weather and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story until i remembered the real life parallel of andrea yates who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them even then i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy rather than a story of divine retribution br br the movie gave me no such comfort though as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad's vision and this as much as some plot holes posed a problem for me regardless of the accuracy of dad's visions regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death 1 roger ebert review 4 12 02
<START> here's one you can watch with a straight face with a script so bad even will ferrell wouldn't be in it br br there are two laughs in hot rod br br 1 the punch dance rod needs to go to his quiet place and before anyone can say kevin bacon he is footloosing a passionate overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big hair faux metal chops of europe br br 2 john farnham's you're the voice in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support the soundtrack is the gag how did the film makers even come across this aussie recording artist a major australian vocalist and a genuine talent who shot to fame in the early '70s covering raindrops keep fallin' on my head then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you're the voice john farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy it leveled mountains in switzerland br br besides these two high points in the film both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit br br andy samberg is rod a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness or his fake mustache yeh someone actually thought that was funny br br without one jump under his starry belt he plans for a 15 bus extravaganza which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian like jason biggs or rob schneider to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever who watches these movies for plot anyway along the way as usual for moronic leads in these comedies he scores a salubrious chick isla fisher who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser br br sissy spacek carrie 1976 has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance then changed her mind and just hung up ian mcshane must've lost a bet to be here
<START> hollywood hotel is a fast moving exuberant wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown hooray for hollywood the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems however including the charming i'm like a fish out of water and silhouetted in the moonlight the best musical number is let that be a lesson to you in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves behind the eight ball a fate which literally befalls slow burning edgar kennedy at the number's end the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent ted healy as dick powell's would be manager fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron glenda farrell as mona marshall's sarcastic gal friday edgar kennedy as a put upon drive in manager mabel todd as mona's goofy sister and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad the racist element mentioned in another review here is a ten second bit where herbert appears in black face during a pseudo gone with the wind sequence it's in questionable taste but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film notably the benny goodman quartet including teddy wilson and lionel hampton in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo the dark eyes sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late but otherwise hollywood hotel is a gem well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release
<START> my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film bring on the coals i'll walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted there's a lot of in spite of in that confession it's a bit movie of the week the screenplay is on the paint by numbers side and most troublingly the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin br br the film's genius is not in what's obvious to the syd field doctored eye character arcs themes construction it's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semi clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightley's excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self determination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen Â not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and un bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling br br the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so as in chadha's bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery Â and is all the more seductive for it br br oh yes and did i mention that it's hilarious
<START> well it's robin hood as 'geezer' all right just as advertised that didn't sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than i'd suspected br br a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyer's daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges not very funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re shooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if he's struggling with half comprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast br br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering high flown dialogue as naturally as if he'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment and as this production shows that's not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they haven't a clue how to handle them br br i'm afraid i didn't even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience they're out of place all right fourth wall busting stuff but really not that funny br br this much promised production reminded me of a limping school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible villainy and b credible characterisation but frankly i wouldn't have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series as of the time of writing i'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scene setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasn't exactly a show stopper though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode 2 i'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer br br which would be a pity because i've got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest
<START> you know the story pretty kids alone in the woods when bam something starts cutting them up br br well this crap is no different a bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before suddenly an unkown creature stars cutting them up and their only help is a doctor biker br br to say this film was bad is an understatement it's smut the acting was horrible br br the creature looked very cheesy and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending which they do not br br there is one bright spot to this film lost star maggie grace as the female lead
<START> this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role br br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10 br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
<START> and an extremely bad one at that how long did this train wreck last 14 episodes or something i can see why now br br i bought the serenity episode from amazon unboxed it was my first purchase so was free that is the only good thing about the experience incident br br i won't comment really on the acting since these were i guess fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show theater or tv if i did then i have easily forgotten them br br but the special effects were absolutely horrendous true this isn't exactly a multi million project but the original star trek did better than this that was thirty five years ago i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys reapers or something like that ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top while chasing after the roadrunner modern jet rocket engines don't even do it that bad br br and that wasn't even the worst of it the wild west type shoot outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci fi film or a gene autry one br br regardless of the hype don't waste your time i did all 80 something minutes of the disaster called firefly
<START> billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fake br br as someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans and many southern english people don't realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead end semi rural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old fashioned pub and where the people's idea of a party was line dancing in some village hall lookalike this was a small close knit community not a metropolitan city br br the working class sheffield men were totally unlike their real life counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they don't chatter and they certainly don't sing in choirs br br even the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wilderness br br as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a vacuum br br anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle class writers and film makers br br it was a gigantic fake br br
<START> writer director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self indulgence 8 Â½ women the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction as they lure and blackmail women guess how many into joining their personal collection of concubines br br think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive and chances are greenaway's done it the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of there's the kabuki obsessed mio the ever pregnant giaconda and beryl who's got a thing for farm animals giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair she's the half woman get it greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny but if this isn't it then what is br br the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan a continuation of themes from his snore worthy but less sexist 1996 film the pillow book but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful 8 Â½ women just gets horny and exploitative greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself
<START> rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones i was too young during the band's mid 70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid 80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a rockin' soundtrack i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass i have to check out some of their albums the rest is history twenty years umpteen ramones lps cassettes cds and three ramones shows later they're still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us r i p all at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
<START> one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story with our men forced to make a decision that they know will change their lives forever in very bad ways at the end of the movie each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week end on the river but muted into a fight for survival the movie except some pretty evident goofs is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath the photography is excellent as well voight reynolds cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake
<START> a killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish br br the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now i'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep there is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line br br the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel br br 4 10
<START> i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day if it is in a theater near you go it's not a funny feel good movie it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie br br the director does an excellent job of character development letting you into the heart mind and hurts of hagar little by little at first her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense as her story unfolds she becomes someone you can understand as in life understanding brings empathy i found her likable by the end of the movie particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake br br hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world her youngest son john who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare br br it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability if you loved her in juno you'll love her in the stone angel br br of course there is ellen burnstyn as hagar there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn i always and only thought of hagar she swept me into her character hook line and sinker br br kari skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada's most cherished authors is impressive she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman hagar the stone angel
<START> normally i'm not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasn't i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the movie br br cut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
<START> i'm a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful
<START> this is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here br br i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end it is clever well paced and very well acted both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters br br the little son pierrot is also very touching br br a thriller which does not seem like one a very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes br br i'll give it a 8 10
