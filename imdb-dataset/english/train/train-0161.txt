<START> please be warned this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ever just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie br br so it officially begins with a party just your average party but there's some guy there he's pretty into kate if you know what i'm saying memorise his face it'll help later br br so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney didn't i say the plot was bad and so takes the tube that's london underground at the middle of the night but she's just stupid like that so the timetable says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes now kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground alone well almost br br so the movie just carries on from there blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body br br in short it's a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick weird psycho or as the case may have it creep br br i'd say give it a go if you're into saw hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much
<START> i really think i should make my case and have every horror and or cult movie buff go and see this movie br br i did br br it is excellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scary br br incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low read no budget they had br br synopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse br br on this website imdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out br br www softfordigging com
<START> henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960 1980 always strong at the box office and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies mafia score settling and world war ii battles verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day gabin belmondo fernandel delon sharif anthony quinn i comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand it's an oddly static film taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence br br montand gives a good performance if somewhat dry and he is well supported by the other actors i couldn't help wondering what costa gavras could have done with this story on the basis of z the lambrakis assassination and l'aveu the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists
<START> this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen in my entire life i wish i could travel back in time and do the following br br 1 find out where the movie war games the dead code was filmed 2 watch the original war games with my current computer knowledge and the eyes of a 1983 preteen 3 break into the pentagon computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered 4 reprogram the whopper to nuke the location of the dead code minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 come back to the present have a beer and get will smith and tommy lee jones to flash my memory blank of the whole event especially my original viewing of the dead code 6 have another beer and watch wars games 7 be happy until the next bad remake of a good 80's movie br br 8 did i forget the have jar jar killed i am not sure if i would have to travel into the future for that maybe i need access to a wormhole
<START> george cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles the acclaimed anthony john colman has driven his wife brita signe hasso away with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career he reluctantly agrees to play othello he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress shelley winters but has no memory of the dastardly deed br br colman seems faultless in this role winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life also in the cast edmond o'brien ray collins joe sawyer and whit bissell
<START> this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters just about every voluptuous middle aged female in hollywood and a touching funny love story the capomezza's and the malacici's are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york they are also at opposite extreme ends of the taste scale their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet naturally they fall in love on stage the mayhem and confusion that this causes as the parents feud with each other and their kids is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza's magnificently tasteless home and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings br br besides the four over the top parents and the charming young lovers the characters include a vaguely wise priest a plain speaking grandma a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car and two doves there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie br br even the family names of the two families are part of the fun capomezza could be interpreted as low brows and malacici could mean stuck up snobs br br if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes you may not like this movie if bette midler embarrasses you you may not like it because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart the rest of us should love it
<START> it's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece i am not a dullard as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the viewer anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from a film i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did i find in this film yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere br br one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place having grown up in america just a decade earlier i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably in other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its 'filmic magic' which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual recalled experience
<START> excellent br br good br br fair br br poor br br go ahead make my day ' br br the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself who was rumored of directing most of magnum force and he brings back the violent society from the first two films however the film still lacks impact and believability this film was released in the early 80s the time of regan and the young republicans the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame this plot would have been better for the enforcer which actually would have made it a good movie what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle br br rating 3 stars
<START> cb4 was awful but it may have given cundieff the idea to it better more like spinal tap than anything else the film is clever from the start surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters more like marx brothers these guys are real and slightly diverse they react to situations like any of us might well we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig or pull guns and beat down a record company exec but you get the picture n n as w with h hats takes itself seriously enough to reel you in then you're hooked rent or get this at all costs even if you're not really into rap music this will still leave you gassing out loud comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas' star wars to gil gerards'buck rogers' i think you see my point
<START> joseph l mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in hollywood history but this film proves that he is already a success by doing sophisticated american dramas such as a letter to three wives and all about eve as well as successfully adapting shakespeare to life in julius caesar mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit broadway play to film and does it with style marlon brando is perfect as sky masterson even if he can't sing too well he is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity frank sinatra is a wonderful singer as expected and does a good job of acting as nathan detroit jean simmons is also very good as sarah brown and her scenes with brando sizzle with great chemistry all supporting actors do their part especially sheldon leonard as harry the horse in a very funny bit still mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world all in all guys and dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have
<START> uma thurman plays sissy a young woman with a gypsy spirit and freakishly large thumbs who hitchhikes cross country eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the whooping crane rain bow phoenix is their lesbian leader bonanza jellybean who falls in love with sissy thumbs or not gus van sant directed and adapted tom robbins' book but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map like sissy maybe that was his goal but it's not involving for an audience notorious box office flop wasn't so much panned as it was ignored and one can see why it's a series of sketches in search of a plot and the performances directorial touches and cinematography are all variable thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride but this pretty much put the kibosh on phoenix's career writer buck henry who didn't write this but perhaps should have gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs br br two thumbs down
<START> there's the danger with the critic philosopher slavoj zizek with his film directed by sophie fiennes which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent horror sci fi surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload but in the pervert's guide to cinema he also makes even the more far reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis i've seen on a collective section of films while it doesn't cover the expansive territory scorsese's movie documentaries cover the same attachments are there and zizek has a definite love for all of these perverse examples and films primarily the work of hitchcock lynch chaplin and tarkovsky yet one shouldn't go into seeing this if you can find it that is i got to see it almost by luck thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse deranged manner if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id super ego and ego harpo's example is most dead on for me br br he's not just one to take on the classics though he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere the ideals of fatherhood male sexuality the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation and female subjectivity are explored perhaps most dead on with vertigo this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if it's the zapruder film where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in blue velvet br br now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere excited and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice over as scorsese does but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality and how they overlap intersect become one and the same or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters i e lost highway by putting himself in the locations the films take place in funniest is first seeing him in the boat heading towards the same dock tippi hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the birds equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi faceted points of frank booth only one when he's in solaris like territory does it seem a little cheesy but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set up and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizek's words come through br br there were some films i of course would've expected chiefly from hitchcock and lynch but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the pervert's guide of cinema top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplin's films albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice' and the ones that one hasn't seen yet i e the ventriloquist horror film dr mabuse stalker among a few others that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow i have to see that immediately no questions asked ' zizek is a powerful writer with his work and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place to be entertained sure but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there as he put it looking into a toilet it's probably one of the greatest films about cinema and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire the id super ego ego and of the supernatural in fantasy that you may never see unless distribution finally kicks in if only on the smallest levels
<START> this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it i'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie
<START> i say 'i'd figure' in that line because frankly i've not seen a hal hartley movie until now it's not that i haven't heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small ny filmmakers when i say small i mean even smaller than jim jarmusch who made ultra personal projects on limited budgets in an ironic way much as with pasolini's salo though in a slightly different context fay grim interests me to see some of hartley's more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he's just taken a big experimental blunder or on the other hand he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and would be godard like cinematic collisions br br i can't quite explain the story which may or may not be a problem i suppose however it's not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded fay grim henry fool i think even if i had that experience it wouldn't make too much of a difference based on the final results there's a lot of international espionage a double plot wrapped inside of another that's fallen through the fake pockets of the title character played in an aloof way by parker posey not sure if that's good or bad either maybe both and also involving a cia operative jeff goldblum as usual a solid presence amid the mania even conjuring some laughs not to mention an orgy laden picture box and author henry fool it's not that the script is totally impenetrable however much it goes into over extended loopholes just for the sake of it because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog br br quite simply the direction just sucks harltey is in love with the third man which is fine but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle with characters having to get into frame equally oddly not since battlefield earth in fact has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect only this time hartley isn't amid a cluster f he's mostly responsible for it this along with the crazy wannabe godard title cards that pop in here and there some a little amusing and some just totally stupid and the montage segments all in still shots and a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind ed wood undermine any of the potential that is in the script which is already fairly hard to decipher in a way it's fascinating to watch how bad this all goes but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip side to total creative control on a sort of small scale story br br but let it be known you'll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of american independent film making this year
<START> the cars in this movie are awesome the acting in this movie is awful the plot and driving scenes don't make much sense and are equally bad if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money good movie for racing fans well there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver if you can't tell the difference go watch it you'll have a blast it really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot if you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or vh1 instead i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with rusted bicycles
<START> seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn't always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the silliest character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a 4 10 just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job don't know how these shows get to play for so long br br if you're really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i'd suggest you watch this
<START> first off i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence i say unfortunately because after seeing election 2 first election seems a bit of a disappointment both films are gangster epics that are similar in form and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel br br in the first election installment we are shown the two competitors for chairman big d and lok after a few scenes of discussion amongst the uncle's as to who should have the chairman title they almost unanimously decide that lok simon yam will helm the triads suffice to say this doesn't go over very well with competitor big d tony leung ka fai and in a bid to influence the takeover big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war lok is determined to become chairman but won't become official until he can recover the dragon head baton a material representation of the chairman's power the current chairman whistle chung wang has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first br br much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election which involves an underling named jet nick cheung a machete and lots of bad guys nick cheung's presence is attention grabbing to say the least i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election as he does deliver more of jet's character in the sequel br br while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film's actors election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo tony leung ka fai and the under appreciated suet lam there really aren't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they're watching real gangsters br br although the performances are great one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to's eye for the camera there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles all of which makes election above all a great looking film br br my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren't integral to the plot while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles underlings and police officers crowding the storyline maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more br br bottom line all in all this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and leisurely pacing that packs a punch it's just a little more complicated than it needed to be
<START> i like the good and evil battle i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done he wasn't the smart cocky know it all he usually plays he shows heart and a more humble humor the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope
<START> released two years before i was born this oscar winning movie has it all lavish technicolor sets and costumes breathtaking cinematography superb wall to wall gershwin music superior choreography a lighter than air screenplay and great performances by kelly levant foch guetary and caron hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore definitely this is my favorite movie of all time a standard by which i judge all other films enjoy enjoy enjoy
<START> is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws orca isn't exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws's success first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at best br br the plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge i couldn't stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentless br br as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good br br the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales don't mate with only one mate as depicted in orca br br overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i'm not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it br br my rating 3 5 10 but for its concept possibly a 5 10
