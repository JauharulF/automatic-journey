<START> in 2005 george w bush started with his second period as a president of the united states north korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons pope john paul ii died after a long illness and a movie called into the blue appeared the existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst one from that year now in 2009 the united states have another president there is another pope new korean nuclear weapons and the film into the blue 2 the reef which is better than the original one but that's the same as saying getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut this sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested the cast of into the blue 2 the reef is composed by tv series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight but who are perfect for showing their bodies chris carmack the o c david anders heroes and alias laura vandervoort smallville marsha tomason lost and audrina patridge the hills bring hollow and boring performances i have liked some previous movies from director stephen herek critters and bill and ted's excellent adventure specially but on this movie he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension emotion or entertainment the characters from this movie are not only badly performed but they are also repulsive honestly i wanted all of them to die the cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for hawaiian hotels into the blue 2 the reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film but that's the same as nothing as i previously said avoid this crappy film at all costs
<START> ladislas starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr beetle an artistic grasshopper and mrs beetle the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame by frame animation the story builds as mr beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper when mr beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend he chases her around angrily but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie however mrs beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper's footage of mr beetle and the dragonfly together mrs beetle thrashes mr beetle with her umbrella mr beetle jumps through the screen and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub and are given human characteristics of jealousy anger lust and revenge the insect characters carry briefcases drive motorcars and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would the novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out even after multiple viewings but as fluid as the movements are the film moves slowly action happens with intricate detail but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process despite its pace the film is an excellent example of starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended
<START> i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory to this day i never did see it after that day back in the 70s in fact i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me i loved it and want my kids to see it does anybody know where i can find it
<START> this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv but it is one of the best movies i've seen the film and its actors won several awards it is gripping fascinating and it will absorb you completely the story of a chase for a killer in iron curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but it's ostensibly a true story i highly recommend it
<START> unlike many i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive its execution however is another matter entirely like so many b minus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers for most of the 22 or so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late night infomercial but not a primetime sitcom even a canadian one notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas unfortunately they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the prairies the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town why are they so hard to find in saskatchewan did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world primed by the cbc's publicists quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom
<START> the only reason i give this movie 8 10 stars and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kelly's character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean stockwell quantum leap al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's i'm 28 and she's 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the 20th century it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kelly's moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century if you were to watch only one part don't miss kelly's dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed
<START> i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this 4 the 900 theater was full and at the end it received a standing ovation this was classic peter falk if you are a falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter falk and paul reiser characters the film's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me i am surprised this didn't make it into general release this was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience a lot of people could relate to situations in this movie this will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem i would rate this 8 0 to 8 5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it
<START> and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of it's just barely legal guys rubbing themselves could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work br br never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i've ever seen it's like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans it's the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10 day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort
<START> the filmmaker inhaled andy goldsworthy's art his search for closeness with the land and the water and his sense of proportion and so gently so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us rivers and tides loves goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight see this movie
<START> this tear teaser written by steve martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach br br the plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending br br avoid at all costs
<START> one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time bill ted's bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s preston esq and ted theodore logan aka wyld stallyns there are two ways to look at this film first you see dumb dialogue far fetched plot juvenile idea or you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity only it's bill and ted this is a tricky fence to balance on but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure it becomes so much more
<START> a group of models is seeking an apartment to live in and are shown one by a local real estate agent unknown to the models and the agent however is that hell's threshold is in the apartment and when crossed the demon dethman is summoned to kill all those in his path the story is told by sam bishop a journalist who was accused of the murders br br although i am a champion of low budget microbudget and independent films i cannot praise this movie the creators take pride in their 24 hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the dvd of his acting prowess but i cannot wrap my head around this why make a film in 24 hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference and why pride yourself on acting that is poor nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines br br through much of the film the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent the dialog is clearly ad libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction the agent also clearly knows nothing about housing she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about incorrectly explains the heat source didn't she see the radiator and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call the terminator please write a script some deviation is fine but this was a mess br br and why were the girls moving in models their careers had no point in the plot and this seems like a forced situation at one point an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of dude they're going to be upset which sounded more natural than any other line though out of place because of the other bad dialog br br the demon made no sense i appreciated the attempt to explain how hell's threshold jumps to random places on earth including apartment fireplaces but why not explain where the demon came from his background involves a man whose love is killed by another man how does this make you a demon also why did we need all these victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field it was overdone br br the dramatic pauses between lines was awful the sam bishop character was by far the worst with the interviewer not far behind does every question require a pause a funny face and a response followed by a pause a funny face and a response i was so frustrated to me the only point was to drag the time out but i'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice br br who was the sam bishop character anyway allegedly he saw all this and was accused of killing the girls but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls so how did he see them and if he didn't how did he know dethman killed them and if he didn't see dethman how does he know dethman is the spirit of apostoles i was so lost was there even an outline for a plot when this was written br br the only part i found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom not that it was really important or anything but it was the only break from boredom i was given i wonder what director felix diaz was thinking his music is very good see the dvd behind the scenes for his impromptu playing but i wonder about his movie making skills although by far the best part of the dvd was the trailer for his superhero excelsior the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time br br i am sorry i have to be so harsh i'd like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film but if superhero excelsior is any indication diaz can make quality so why did he choose to avoid that here perhaps the world will never know
<START> a student filmmaker enlists a b grade actress a delectably diva ish molly ringwald to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull kylie minogue tried to make 12 years ago it's a curious plot choice to say the least as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors the film has a curse on it because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set but she's back because she needs the exposure unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table in fact it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography lots of film world name dropping a la scream except it's aussie name dropping jane campion see how this isn't as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare the editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a well dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at don't worry we'll treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesn't mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump ha and molly's ridiculous one liners were enough to not regret renting this one you got any diet coke in here as she rides in the film professor's car and does anyone know where i can buy any tofu the first thing she mutters on the set and where the hell is my agent oh wait that's what i was thinking for her
<START> i just saw this movie on hbo and it was really good a tragic love story indeed i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident it's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can heal someone's heart laura leighton all of 27 when she made this movie was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart unfortunately since his family is wealthy and her's is not problems develop br br it's playing on hbo some more times this month check out the schedule here http www hbo com apps schedule scheduleservlet action detail detail focus id 598947
<START> there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious i'm inclined to be in the middle i'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film e g the cruel cutting of the story badly rotoscoped charecters over acting etc but dispite this i still love this film the rotoscoping when done properly adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score magic sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film br br no doubt i'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review ah well such is life
<START> this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his vision' to the screen he has done it with batman' sleepy hollow' and now this this is not a remake the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and charleton heston makes a cameo burton has reconstituted the entire story watering it down for today's mass viewership br br the original planet of the apes was a product of its time during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal in that context pota was allegorical reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior the dialectic between colonel taylor charleton heston dr cornelius roddy mcdowall and dr zira kim hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious br br burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties this is apes for dummies it is superficial and jejune substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance the surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene burton's ending simply mocks the audience taunting i know something you don't know and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out ' br br from a technical perspective as is always the case with burton's film the film is excellent the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding though i continue to dislike his dark look however thirty three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script br br the story has been reduced to a monster movie the humans band together behind captain davidson mark wahlberg to fight the monstrous apes aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably helena bonham carter as ari the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence perfect for today's fast food mentality br br the acting is mixed mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role walberg is excellent at playing dark sullen characters that are tormented but strong this part requires an inspirational hero a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager br br then there is tim roth his is a virtuoso performance single handedly saving the film from total ruin roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time additionally his physical acting is superlative rendering a chimp man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists br br this film is a great disappointment it is decent entertainment as long as you check your brain at the door i rated it a 3 10 from a technical perspective it is much better than that perhaps a 9 10 however the story is an insult to the original franchise it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is of course it's true but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption
<START> when this first came out 6 months after the tragedy i didn't want to see it i didn't want to open old wounds i regretted it now i have seen the movie thank god i did it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd i salute you it offered me closure i can now move on with my life
<START> i've read a few books about bonnie and clyde and this is definitely more accurate than the beatty dunaway version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck barrow and the capture of his wife blanche this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of blanche grieving over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our anti heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes in life bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death the script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads very disappointing stick with beatty and dunaway their's may not be the true story but it's a great film
<START> i'm not going to approach and critique the theories of raw i mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well made and not a site debating philosophy br br having said that this video really blows it's one talking head shot of raw after another some of it is archival video so you can see how he has aged over the years and that's pretty cool but otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous br br it's a strange comparison but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle funny lady another really bad movie after a while i was so od'd on barbra i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment but it was all about barbra well this video is raw's funny lady br br so if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight then be my guest for me i couldn't take it after 20 minutes
<START> i have seen this movie more than several times on tv i always watch it again never turning the channel this movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge of your seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid helen hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie i recommend this movie to anyone
