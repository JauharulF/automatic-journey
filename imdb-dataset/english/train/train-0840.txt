<START> spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that lucius shepard br br the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif Â innocence interrupted by men Â permeates the entire film br br the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children br br all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time br br the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated br br spielberg's film however re frames walker's story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs br br this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words it's the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv it's all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy br br of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walker's novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin br br beyond walker's hate letter to black men and spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg's camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celie's kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones' ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams br br problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone br br and so there's a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture br br 3 10 a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless
<START> i picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had keanu reeves but after 5 minutes of watching i noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it's fake and not convincing it doesn't end there almost all the characters act so badly it's laughable the only acceptable acting was by alan boyce david but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again you never even know why he did it everything about this movie screams low quality i can't believe how such a thing gets released i was tempted many times to stop watching in fact i did half way through it i decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the imdb to check what other's thought about it i found zero comments not surprised so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it the only good thing going for me was the high school rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that's not worth it br br very bad acting and directing terrible movie
<START> beyond dirt cheap this shot on video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through it's got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while br br what's strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is english dubbed the dubbers seem to be american fans penpals of the germans who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character a white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick ebonics 'kno wahm sayin' comrad
<START> this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over poor directing over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not i'm not sure what makes the film worse oliver stone does his worst directing ever from scenes where woody harrelson's face morphs for no reason or robert downey jr's dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers this movie is simply a mess
<START> this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself br br hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment br br if you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you 2 out of 10
<START> it must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film probably cruise the exec prod saw what was happening and had towne use much much more of the nude footage in the final cut then towne wanted to to make up for the disaster he saw looming maybe cruise even thought of titanic a few items colin farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag but he's one of the flavors of the decade a producer's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films he has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes i think he would have been at his best as a film actor albeit not as rich or famous as he is now playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act the trap of spending a lot of money for period sets costumes cars et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash wax no one seems to want anything to look well worn or dirty is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items br br this was a story about the depression thirties folks not a disney broadway musical about that era how about doing it in black and white or better yet given caleb deschanel as your d p have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times it should have been after all a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did in the depression more on farrell did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer h l mencken on the wall did i see his eyes roll at one point hayek and farrell as a sexually dynamic duo sending a boy to do a man's work perhaps in the book which i haven't read the story was about an older woman and a youth i cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because i bailed out early on but the memory of the scenes i did see made me think that someone was doing a not too amusing parody of a noir movie sort of what saturday night live has been like for the past decade not funny in my mind i kept thinking of a guy noir sketch music and all
<START> a meteor hit's crater lake hence our title awakening a plesiosaur who proceed's to snack on the hick population in california that hick capital of the world br br there's bad movies and then there's the crater lake monster which somehow managed to escape mst3k featuring grating acting a decent stop motion beast and more this is a dreadful piece of 1970's low budget exploitation monster movie dreck br br while the movie is guilty of many crimes the biggest one is arnie and mitch two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief they bumble around fight to stock banjo music ogle women and act like pathetic excuses of humanity the characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity
<START> this week i just thought it would be fun to catch up with corey haim with just having seen the two lost boys films last week and all not that i'm a fan boy not by far but i did like those two coreys in some films back in my early teen days br br so i prepared myself for three films starring him unfortunately i picked dream machine as a first never seen it before and it was so godawfully horrible i just decided to lock corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first before i pop in something else of his but i managed to struggle my way through this film first i had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as ferris bueller's day off 1986 but got caught up in its own delusions practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller the only good thing about dream machine is the premise a dead body in the trunk of a porsche all the rest fails so badly it's embarrassing even the most for haim i can dig him being his young enthusiastic self but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines this clearly wasn't the case in dream machine so we have a perfect car yes that black porsche haim's perfect girlfriend just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film the perfect murder almost some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk never really succeeds and then at the end of the film thinks he's michael myers minus the white william shatner mask and mistakes corey haim for jamie lee curtis don't think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried a stupid unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesn't know how to direct his cast great accomplishment br br one last question for mr haim who's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie yours or the director's so not done
<START> i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie it brought joseph's life of hardship good natured optimism enduring faith in people and god and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe if anyone of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way i would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie i give the movie a 10 and encourage honest souls to view it at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed in a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold ann pruitt
<START> i really love this movie i remember one time when i was in 2nd grade my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel this movie however can be a little frightening for 2nd graders such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing fagin's face for the first time on the screen one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film i would give them an a
<START> this is one great movie i have played all the nancy drew games and have read the books and i never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny if you never heard of nancy drew read the first book secret of the old clock so you can kinda' get used to nancy then you can watch the movie because in the movie they don't really introduce the characters' names fast my whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting this is an ultimate come back from the previous nancy drew movies which the nancy drew actor didn't seem to match this movie is much like alex rider stormbreaker it's so cool nancy drew lovers you must watch this
<START> john boorman's deliverance concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawasseeÂ the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of landÂ br br the four friends emphasize different characters a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it burt reynolds a passionate family man and a guitar player ronny cox an overweight bachelor insurance salesman ned beatty and a quiet thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe jon voight br br what follows is the men's nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of natureÂit is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wildernessÂ br br superbly shot this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenesÂ
<START> not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at hong kong's triad gangs called election because a new leader or 'chairman' is elected by ancient traditions every two years two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory the asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right
<START> after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp who thought that a franchise could be born sc ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much compared to the first movie sleepaway camp ii is worth the rental br br pros entertaining doesn't take itself too seriously like sc i inspired killings cons crappy acting and mullets abound br br bottom line 5 10 br br
<START> i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd well i bought it on dvd from borders no less while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of extra's a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set but are tacked on the final dvd if you buy the dvd set get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier you will need to swap dvd's in and out of your player to see them in order but you will be glad you did br br s
<START> rented the movie as a joke my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well thanks for the jeep tom whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy
<START> i've watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the director's place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching
<START> una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces it is in these dull empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of ettore scola's two leading characters marcello mastroianni and sophia loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives it is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them all men would really feel sorry for sophia loren's character all women would surely cry their hearts out at marcello mastroianni's existential plight disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber poignant film most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women this is a film for which italian director ettore scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction his idea is to show how the arrival of hitler changed destinies of ordinary italian folks a word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great marcello mastroianni he acts as a real man who does not beg for pity he happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life a true masterpiece of cinema
<START> perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by nancy allen and linda farentino c thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here while on marijuana why did this need to be included this weakened plot considerably also farentino's charac would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship would does movie try to say not much
<START> i first discovered alexander korda's 1940 fantasy the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re issue billed as the wonder show of the century both korda technicolor films the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made as the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950's both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice but not as it should be now comes the m g m dvd 3 dec 2002 issue the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once i watched it a second time the only extras are a spanish dubbed version sub titles in both english spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer thank you m g m for this exceptional dvd release now one can only hope that korda's four feathers and a restored version of korda's jungle book to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on dvd
