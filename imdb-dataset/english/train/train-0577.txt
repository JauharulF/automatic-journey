<START> i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to cb4 i was blown away i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great way better than cb4 the characters the songs the plot everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by siskel and egbert and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick you know it's good
<START> intimate and specific yes a bit of a cinderella story but only after many convoluted turns earning it's way deeper and deeper into antwone's psyche only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial this is the stuff that heals nations this is one of our great national stories antwone's path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history the history of slavery and its aftermath in his first directorial effort first of many i hope denzel washington confirms once again that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul
<START> michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father the creepy ray wise at a sprawling windmill powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young scheming and seductive stepmother from hell the yummy clare wren thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family an edgy stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tv where i first saw it it is beautifully written smartly acted and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it it is an undiscovered classic
<START> an incredible little english film for so many reasons first it's a rare look a laurence olivier in a light comedy while his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot being english it didn't have the big budget of the hollywood films of the same era and it often shows but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an england that would soon be gone when we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest american counter part it happened one night' were in their day as risquÃ© as fatal instinct' was in our time but after watching and enjoying this movie the first time i can't help but feel sadness when i watch it today with half of film shoot before 1950 gone saving the remaining films means hard choices and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important the color shifting lack of contrast and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking this movie along with it happened one night' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch or better yet why not a double feature
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham's name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didn't even watch the whole thing i decided i didn't care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about
<START> this is just horrible really horrible trash yes we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie Â may have even been a hit as a porn movie Â this tries to mask itself as a film with actual things to say with real emotion and struggle it isn't it's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time i'm sure all of these women and men in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s but not in the actual movie business br br the acting was hackneyed so bad i mean real terrible the writing was even worse i can't lay all blame on these actors Â they had nothing to work with the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar as a sniper these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough if there was more writing better writing much better writing and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with br br this movie should have been shot made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along it would have made more money it practically is a hardcore porn film already and it remains the only non porn movie i've seen that shows a male erect penis
<START> i knew my summary would get you how is this movie like a pet rock and disco well unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s you probably can't understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock and frankly at least in the case of pet rocks i still don't understand it completely they're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation the same can be said for kay kyser and his band at the time the 1940s mostly they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with boris karloff bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film yet if you didn't live at that time it was well before my time you wonder why anyone liked this sort of entertainment after all kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very very broad i e unsophisticated and cheesy frankly i couldn't stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film because of these factors the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed br br the film involves kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live once there the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin eventually it culminates in some attempts on sally's life and a sÃ©ance of sorts it's all played for laughs and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast br br overall it's passable entertainment at best as a lugosi and karloff fan i sure felt cheated having to watch kyser and his knuckleheads
<START> when i first heard about moon child i thought it was a joke after a few months i figured i guess it's for real the few reviews i read that weren't made by squealing fangirls were not very promising br br when i was given the opportunity to watch it i was fully prepared to groan wince and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness br br i was more than a little surprised and in a good way br br yes moon child has its moments of cheese camp and general dorkiness i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui a man not known for his sanity but all in all it was wholly enjoyable br br no it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very very heartfelt amusing with fun choreography a touching score and a fun cast i know little of japanese cinema so i can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience i was rather impressed br br if you can enjoy a good action movie a good drama a good comedy see this film at least rent it since it's coming to region 1 br br on a side note there is zero homosexual homoerotic content in this film i didn't even see much of a subtext don't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you
<START> in a woman under the influence mabel goes crazy but i can see why she does go crazy if i lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has i would go crazy too everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it she is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer br br to start with the one person closest to her in her life her husband nick is a little off his rocker he is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile the rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support the one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is he is just making her feel worse she relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her when she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act instead of comforting her he just yells at her and tells her what to do br br the other major people in her life are her parents her parents do nothing in her life for her mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her in the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand and when he does get it he still does nothing they do nothing to help mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period the only person that tries to do something for her is nick's mom nick's mom is adamant about having mabel committed she doesn't want to have nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her it seems as though everyone is against mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore they all want to live their own lives and do nothing for mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't that is why she went crazy and why she had to be committed it was her family's entire fault
<START> it never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor and put him to waste in a film such as this robert de niro is one of the best hollywood stars of all time but even he couldn't save this movie in fact his character is much the same as the one he played in cape fear which was actually pretty good but i can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie i believe it gets old and that is the case here br br there's nothing surprising in this movie but then the story has been told a million times before wesley snipes is your typical baseball player and his conceit shows through in his characterization de niro plays the obsessed fan but his role in this film is less than entertaining br br however because de niro is in this film that makes it a draw if you are a fan no pun intended who sees everything he does no matter how bad but to see de niro at his best see midnight run goodfellas or cop land or even go way back and check out taxi driver or godfather ii don't waste your time with this drivel br br my rating 3 10
<START> bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding ' to wit a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper while critics love 'member of the wedding ' i find julie harris to be a jumbo drag and an adenoidal scenery chomping thespian in everything she's been in this portrays irritating rich idiots as in last year at marienbad but this time it's a travelogue br br in this preminger movie sequences develop but characters do not for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father daughter relationship between seberg and niven making uncomfortable sexual readings possible once the conflict is introduced seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love ' seberg's vacuous narration is like something out of strange interlude it is not good i really wish someone other than niven was in his role he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies he never gets around to the character br br in the most memorable sequence an evening out dancing becomes a free for all in a harbor bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise 'the conformist ' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain as in black narcissus night of the iguana king and i heaven knows mr allyson tea and sympathy etc etc really kerr was a horrible actress i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash or even better start with one br br people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this
<START> a lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrows so i won't be very popular in saying that i found it to be rather boring the idea behind it was interesting but it seems to drag so much i think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness sometimes horror films set in darkness can work such as humongous but scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film a lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy most were hard to even see if a little more lighting had been used perhaps it could've been better br br there's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge apart from dark night of the scarecrow which is much better i would recommend that over scarecrows any day
<START> i've seen tons of hk actioners and this one is right at the top of the genre the action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie the kung fu is spectacular the pyrotechnics eye popping the stunt work heartstopping the editing is perfectly paced heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work this film is directed by old pro corey yuen whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre including the jet li vehicle the legend of fong sai yuk if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three dimensional character though martin the male lead comes closest to it this movie is full of archetypes rather than characters the sexy killer the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend the cackling villains that said shannon lee has a terrific screen presence she's great with the fighting the stunts and the guns when she's onscreen it's hard to take your eyes off her she's that good why isn't this woman a major star
<START> patricia hunter oh professor do you also make a habit of collecting coffins dr lorenz why yes in a manner of speaking i find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed br br interesting bela lugosi glen or glenda dracula vehicle where he plays the mad scientist i was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping br br luana walters girls in prison was really appealing as a sensual reporter patricia hunter who was to be a victim but woman power trumps evil scientist every time br br 2'11 angelo rossitto and creepy frank moran who liked to stoke the women's hair added to the film br br interesting look at a 40s horror film
<START> this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies out br br in the gangster drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline this movies does not i mean sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out clichÃ© then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable this movie does not br br sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family but this movie does not go in this direction even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes wasn't he already down and out why does he do it again br br so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama but then again this movie is just not because of focusing on cool production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve br br it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence would be political incorrect these days wouldn't it but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie like there are so so many out there with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does br br so all in all i just can't recommend it br br 1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing
<START> when i watch a low budget film i know what to expect i expect the acting not to be as good budget reasons i expect the lighting not to be as good budget reasons i expect the sound not to be as good budget again stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film i'm a filmmaker myself so i understand the budget constraints on a low budget film stealing locations shots etc the list goes on and on i don't want to say all the acting was bad jose rosete chris angelo victor zaragoza are good raul martinez is a natural not sold on carl washington yet he has to understand that every line is not important some are throw away lines i say if a film makes you want to see what happens next it's a good film i liked this movie i gave it an 8 i wanted to see what was gonna happen next great job quiroz brothers
<START> just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery's wife a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw and kid a very young scarlet johannsen in an alligator skinner's shack br br the kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane and even then only once
<START> this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen this makes your run of the mill tv movie look like reservoir dogs based on a book by the one and only britney spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from virginia madsen i hope you got paid well to save it the story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal ms spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way there is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day never ever again
<START> it wasn't good the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new' personalities or lack thereof i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was it was serious it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channel everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection br br the most disappointing part was the horrible songs not catchy not amazing in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun you remember them and want to sing them but the songs in this movie weren't creative in the least it's as if they're talking in a annoying sing song voice quite weakly disappointing i don't have that want to sing them feeling you normally get from a disney movie br br it's as if not one wanted to do this movie so they barely made an effort this movie would needs a new story line new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying look at me look at me i'm so annoying mentality of this generation of disney '
<START> this film is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen br br please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction br br shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as direction which this film needed in droves not that the writing was all the wonderful rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way the pseudo documentary style prized by those who don't know how to direct br br this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film making which is most of them br br just terrible it says a lot about sundance and what it's become that victor vargas was showcased there
