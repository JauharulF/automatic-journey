<START> this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas br br the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up 'n' under and a very funny man rip br br this underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn't to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
<START> saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca my god what was the director thinking film professors should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film first off this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the film takes place partially in the waystation some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere where nothing really takes place br br the acting is beyond bad so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films there is one or two decent performances including the guys who played jacob and fenner but it's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue which bordered on absurd the writer whom i assume is also the director writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain br br the overall production value is pretty good but to be honest with a film this bad it's easy to overlook it the production design is pretty good although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar the costumes and make up are okay and i understand the production was working with a low budget it's just when the characters speak or they try and push the plot forward the film unravels into a muck of crap br br as i've said this film is god awful it's like the director writer watched a lot of sci fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this my only hope is that he used other people's money on this because if he used his own he's a total sucker
<START> this movie is based on the art of frank frazetta the mythical fantasy illustrator some of the characters are straight out of his paintings the death dealer being the best example surprisingly the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope the technique of tracing a live action sequence and this film is no exception however since the subject of the movie is quite realistic all characters are humans this works pretty well br br but what i really like here is the plot for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe this movie has the feeling of the best conan comics not surprisingly since roy thomas is the writer of the marvel series of our favourite cimmerian this is a far cry from the crappy live action conan not to speak of all the b movie of the genre br br definitely recommended
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times unlike other meyer films the sexual antics are down to a minimum some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful br br the film is a strange combination of sado masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts it's as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation blackploitation by having a higher moral message meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil however because they cancel each other out you end up with nothing br br because it so bad in so many ways it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste perhaps because it is so bad we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable
<START> cheech chong's next movie 1980 was the second film to star to pot loving duo of cheech marin and tommy chong the lovable burn out smokers are now roommates they live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day but cheech is the responsible one he has a job and a steady girlfriend one day cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get chong out of the house another problem arises as well cheech's brother red cheech is another role is in town and wants to hang with him firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone cheech pawns chong off and red what kind of adventures will chong and red get into will cheech get his freak on how long will chong go without some smoke just watch cheech chong's next movie to find out br br tommy chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel he received some experience when he did some uncredited work on up in smoke funny but not as good as the first film but cheech and chong fans will enjoy it followed by nice dreams br br recommended
<START> dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result violent sexy milligan at his most home made little better than a home movie as much of milligans films are this is a trip into depravity 1960's style notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome playing now more as quaint though decidedly r rated the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around
<START> some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution
<START> jafar panahi's comedy drama offside portrays some women trying to enter a tehran sports arena from which women are banned the official reason lots of foul language and the soccer players have their legs showing but of course it's really a case of sexism so most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men br br as i understand all of jafar panahi's movies this one included are banned in iran the real tragedy is that the cia's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the koran to establish a chauvinistic society and that george w bush's current policy towards iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship br br above all this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system not a great movie but worth seeing considering that all jafar panahi's movies are banned i wonder how he's able to even make them
<START> this is one the few movies i can watch over and over if you've never seen it give it a shot richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly it reminds me of julia's untimely demise it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear
<START> br br i watched this movie just a little while ago and i found that this movie was terrible it moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining br br sorry for all those that liked it this is only my opinion
<START> i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was boring and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage it was made in 1925 i think it absolutely incredible for it's time br br the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable it took them a week just to cross a river the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock sometimes barefoot in the snow i would like to see anybody do that now br br i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story
<START> i realize that alot of people hate this movie but i must admit that it is one of my favorites i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies br br first off i think that people never give the story any credit much like back to the future time travel is hard to write and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey br br i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie they looked cooler acted cooler and said cooler things br br the set design of this movie is awsome as well the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth br br the costume design was awsome as well bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey where as in excellent adventure they look rather like well as they would put it fags br br even the music in this movie is awsome the score especially there so much i could say about this film cause i love it but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure which i also love by the way br br get down with your bad self
<START> after hearing about george orwell's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life i'm now 37 but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what i've just seen br br i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as i'm sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it i'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it br br on the plus side br br the cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making br br now for the down sides and there are plenty br br there is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation br br who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isn't he on the front line why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink he's drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them what's the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that haven't read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on br br the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same br br also i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage br br i personally can't abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that i've seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is br br there's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline br br i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this br br all in all very disappointed in something i've waited for years to watch
<START> garam masala is one of the funniest film i've seen in ages akshay kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time john abraham is amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far paresh rawail is superb as usual in most of his films the director priyadarshan has delivered great movies in the past hera pheri hungama and hulchul being some of the best garam masala is his funniest film he has made the three newcomer actresses are average rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie i was impressed to see how priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time all 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house packed with loads of laughs this is one non stop entertainer
<START> a double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role here othello as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award as well as the golden globe as best actor let's take the second point first br br is anthony john colman's greatest role or even his signature role i have my doubts on either level but it is among his best known roles most of his career ronald colman played decent gentlemen frequently in dangerous or atypical situations he is bulldog drummond cleaned up in the goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist fighting crime he is raffles the great cricket player and even greater burglar trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor he is robert conway the great imperial political figure who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth shangri la he is dick heldar manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist i can add sidney carton and rudolf rassendyll to this list but here he is not heroic in fact he is unconsciously villainous he murders one person and nearly kills two others it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill his behavior here is anti social br br to me colman should have gotten the oscar for heldar or carton or conway all more typical of his acting roles but the academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members colman's anthony john is a very good performance and at one point truly scary when alone with signe hasso in her home she at the top of a staircase and him at the base they have an argument she demands that tony leave saying she won't see him he stares at her his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before and he says oh no you won't he starts moving upstairs frightening hasso and she runs into her room he stops himself and leaves it actually is the real highpoint of his performance even more than his assaulting of hasso on stage or of edmond o'brien or his killing of shelley winters it showed his blind fury for that moment it was to me an oscar worthy performance but it is only that moment i'm glad he was recognized for the role but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance br br his actual performance in the shakespearian role of othello is not great but bearable too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style one wonders if that was due to the coaching of walter hampden who probably knew how to handle the role properly or a reaction to it nowadays othello is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one paul robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman orson welles in his movie of othello and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello all three white actors did the role in black face my personal favorite of the three is welles who seems the most subtle but even watching welles' fine film version makes me angry that robeson never got to put his performance with jose ferrer as iago on film br br now the first question can an actor get that wrapped up in a role i heard different things about this some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set others have found a role they have to be stimulating influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role it seems a melodramatic hackneyed idea br br as a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with cukor kanin and gordon in 1944 a b feature the brighton strangler starring john loder had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous jack the ripper type and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind there was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife i think the title was men are not gods but i'm not sure but due to colman's name and career and cukor's directing it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea it even reached comedy finally on an episode of cheers where diane chambers is helping an ex convict who may have acting talent and they put on othello at the bar just after he sees her with sam malone kissing only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex convict and can't delay the production long enough she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play br br the cast of a double life was first rate and cukor's direction was as sure as ever so the film is definitely worth watching but despite giving colman an interestingly different role it was not his best work on the screen
<START> even by 1942 standards of movie making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme the machinations of one half of a pair of husband wife ex husband ex wife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another divorce or an eventual separation by means of jealousy humiliation or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features women with a strong indomitable screen presence and who played independent proto feminist characters in both movies both women were estranged divorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon to be husbands and re igniting their passion for each other br br the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here it's norma shearer in the cary grant role out this time to ward off an ex boyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo the problem is shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid to late twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fiancÃ©e on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech inflections but in overall essence br br but the worst part of it is shearer herself for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over acting over emoting and over gesturing which while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of most of her roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs miniver on mega hits now voyager and mrs miniver is a mystery but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting that she'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and can't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible such could be the case here she seems lost she seems tired she seems ill at ease going through autopilot instead of living the part after this film she would make no more but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s
<START> i'll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink imprisons and tortures her then poses as a captive to have sex with her that is the single twist and punchline of the film it's torture as slow motion date rape and it's not even a good movie it's not so bad it's good it's just bad br br it should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile why no one had the cojones to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond me br br don't give your money to these poop peddlers
<START> the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake i expected a lot sincerely br br the sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept the situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful br br this time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake also the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad br br the violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence i mean there's a swat team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants you surely expect something different when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money back br br anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects br br a mess that let down the fans of the remake like me that's why sequels are never welcomed at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original
<START> the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k f flick from the shaw brothers' stable exc maybe master killer it has the artists who came to be known as simply the venoms some of the best fight choreography ever and surprisingly for a kung fu movie a great plot one of my all time favorites
