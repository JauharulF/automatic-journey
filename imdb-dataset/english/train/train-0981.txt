<START> anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film this film is not under rated it is a bad movie br br there should be no comparisons between this film and the naked gun or airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny class reunion is neither of those things the sad thing is it had such potential good cast good story lines but the good jokes are few and far between the scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing the stoner guys the vampire the blind girl not funny the only funny character were delores the one who sold her soul to the devil br br national lampoon has made some really good films animal house vacation but this isn't one of them i certainly expected more from john hughes
<START> there have been so many many films based on the same theme single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex pays him and then guess what she falls in love with him there's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending this has been done many times br br the thing is i knew this before starting to watch but despite this i was still looking forward to it in the right hands with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours br br this was none of these br br this was dire br br a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me i truly did not care if she got her man or remained single and unhappy br br a male lead who after a few of his endless words of wisdom i wanted to kill just to remove that smug look i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all seeing all knowing enlightenment br br a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters none of them seemed to have jobs all of them had more money than sense a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend plus i would miss you even if we had never met i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name woody but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film
<START> i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention maybe even missing the first half so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time i certainly did this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever i can't believe i thought this film was boring br br a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it it is truly horrifying oh and did i mention that the theme song is great as well well it is and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere br br everyone should see this movie for the experience just don't expect a picnic
<START> this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides br br it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story wise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east br br people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film
<START> movie there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie its truly awful not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick characters actors denzel has done exactly what he does in every movie so no surprise there here is a little mind game for the readers quickly think of 10 denzel movies now count how many of them were in which he played a cop detective body guard whatever clive owen hmmmmmm this guy needs a better role on his plate soon his best performance was i think in beyond borders other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in sin city surely this guy knows acting what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles he is in desperate need of a better agent jodie foster was brilliant in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life she has done better she has had better roles it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie plot plot was not confusing in fact i could think of such a plot in fact the whole movie while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner i mean come on spoiler on the way i am sick of the un necessary haulocast and the racism token the movie is about bank robbers why put the haulocast and the racism in there nice try playing with people's emotions worked on anyone not me police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages riiiiiiight please we're talking about us police force and security here nobody could find out where clive was i mean they didn't find anything different with that room who're we kidding conclusion sure go watch this movie if nothing you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was at least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast mistake
<START> higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background it's a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we have to be able embrace and understand diversity some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps
<START> i've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing it's so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in cliche ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull it's as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true to life gusto or didn't have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard issue bad lifetime tv movie
<START> very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty row film company prc who usually put out really cheesy films like devil bat or the flying serpent german expatriate director wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio bound swamp set gaunt and ghoulish charles middleton is effective as the strangler
<START> a young man kills a young woman for no reason the man's brother is jailed on charges that he was an accomplice but soon escapes upon escaping the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he ropes his girlfriend in on the plot if this isn't bad enough the situation quickly makes a downward spiral br br this film had some good aspects and many bad ones its strongest aspect was lead actress emily haack setting aside the fact she's nude in a fair amount of this film she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character i see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way i was convinced she was a ruthless individual br br also the makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches graphic nudity both male and female coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not shied away from i like my horror films to push the boundaries a little bit and this one ignored them altogether gladly skipping towards gomorrah maybe it was too much but i think they achieved what they were looking for br br but now the negative aspects first and most noticeable this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this i can excuse that the plot was decent the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing a more realistic feel so i won't scold them for having low grade equipment what i will scold them for is the use of poor choices in shots for no reason i can ascertain besides plumping the movie there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery i don't really know why and i frankly started dozing off at this point because it was so long and pointless br br i also take issue with the title the idea here was to deceive people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic i spit on your grave now there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of the woman from this other film and the themes are very loosely the same a woman getting revenge on men but there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store customer to think they were getting a sequel this was deceptive and dishonest br br my last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense not even a little bit a woman is killed in the beginning for no reason a prison escapee finds time to kidnap people to torture them for no reason because they wronged his girlfriend the same man goes from good to very evil without explanation likewise the female lead haack turns fro ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic for no reason at all and against people who for the most part were only marginally mean to her a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong but by no means worth getting tortured for br br don't let this title fool you or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking yes some scenes were shocking but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a nap if you see this in the video store or on netflix just keep browsing or rent it and we can sit around and vent about it for hours you have been warned
<START> michael winner is probably best known for his revenge themed films such as death wish and chato's land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema as the sentinel of 1977 proves the sentinel which is based on a novel by john konvitz who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as rosemary's baby the exorcist or the omen but as far as i am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even creepier br br allison parker christina raines is a beautiful young new york model traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend chris sarandon allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also affordable in an old mansion in brooklyn the new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice this may not be an adequate plot synopsis but i would hate to spoil any of this film's great moments so i will not give any further plot description what i will say however is that the sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome the film is imaginatively photographed and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film as mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shock moments and genuine scares the film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as christopher walken jeff goldblum jerry orbach beverly d'angelo and tom berenger before becoming really famous the cast also includes stars like ava gardner horror icon john carradine burgess meredith and my personal favorite the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective i've been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time mostly for films like death wish and chato's land the sentinel is yet another great film in winner's repertoire and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard boiled revenge cinema but also of atmospheric occult horror all in all the sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans
<START> disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine here we see astaire doing what are essentially stage dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film best of all the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio tv husband wife comedy career doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s george was once a tap dance instructor their two numbers with fred are high points of the film and worth waiting for the first soft shoe trio is a warm up for the chin up exhilarating carnival number in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions it almost seems spontaneous fan of fred astaire and burns allen will find it worth bearing up under the plot i've seen this one 4 or 5 times and find the fast forward button helpful
<START> so fox pulled the plug midway through a drama mystery br br how lame is that do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens why weren't the remaining already filmed episodes aired in the us they were broadcast elsewhere br br hey fox are you listening this was a great show but you left us hanging if you're going to introduce new drama mysteries at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid theme every time something like this happens and it seems to happen a lot with you i e fox there are more of those who will wait and see before investing their time this means you will see an artificially low interest share and are more likely to end the series see it is a vicious cycle don't let us down again
<START> the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again however i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director attenborough's credits that puzzles me aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film
<START> okay truthfully i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking hutton jolie and duchovny how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie's natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even david's humor matched up to jolie's spark and fire as for hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it 8 stars
<START> victor mclaglen the title character of john ford's the informer reminded me of the circus man from fellini's la strada anthony quinn played the brutish man who may have even been influenced by the pug faced oscar winning performance given by mclaglen poverty stricken dublin is the true life atmospheric setting of the picture which takes place in 1922 dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick mclaglen's large simple character just wants to go to america and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman one is the previous the other a wanted sign should he do it and get the money to go br br john ford once famously said my name is ford i make westerns after seeing this film he obviously could do a heck of a lot more the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about and the look of the piece is amazing consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night ford was always known for his luminescent gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters this is hard in color but he did it in pictures like the searchers painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner victor mclaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting but by the sheer simplicity of his acting he shoves a lot he knocks people out he is a brute who knows no better he should however know whether or not to cross the ira br br see the film to find out the gritty details see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters placing more emphasis on them this was usually only seen in silent films especially chaplin the topic of naming names or informing is obviously still important just look at how the media covered this year's oscars giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal
<START> what an incomprehensible mess of a movie something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear and you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word butthorn either gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from lethal weapon and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity william smith does another turn as a russian soldier the same character he played in red dawn a few years earlier after playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies sadly he'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in every which way you can
<START> films such as chocolat beau travail and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the world's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film the intruder l'intrus adds to the depth of her portfolio a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jean luc nancy's memoir of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective impressionistic terms br br louis trebor michael subor is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in ingmar bergman's wild strawberries attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit man br br whatever the case he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences facial close ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the french swiss border and has an estranged son sidney gregoire collin whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette florence loiret caille and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his money br br when the film opens we meet antoinette a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband when she comes home she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue in cheek if she has anything to declare other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis' imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film's first half hour a pharmacist bambou who prepares his medication a neighbor bÃ©atrice dalle who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian organ dealer katia golubeva who he tells he wants a young man's heart br br relentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless intruding into other people's lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmusch's dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godard br br godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes the baby's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart
<START> zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead while trying to escape the man is shot at the metal container holding the chemical is breached the man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims kenny deran sarafian his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help patricia beatrice ring her friend lia deborah bergammi who has been pecked by zombie birds general morton is in charge of the situation has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world but will he his men succeed br br this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke therefore couldn't finish the film so producer franco gaudenzi asked second unit director bruno mattei writer claudio fragasso to step in complete the film apparently mattei fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage fulci shot added a lot of their own zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50 50 split the script by fragasso is an absolute mess none of it is well thought out is just as stupid as it gets the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it's on steroids then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft there are so many things wrong with zombi 3 scene after scene of terribly thought out ineptly directed action awful character's really dull broken english dialogue which doesn't make sense half the time then there's the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air bite someones neck the scene when the guy's in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try kill them by hand even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles it's one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film then there's the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but can't rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass what since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass this all may sound 'fun' but believe me it's not it's a really bad film that is just boring repetitive simply doesn't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs br br it's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot it has a bland lifeless feel about it for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine thinning out as it disperses across the scene since a lot of it is set during the day it doesn't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever when they do get it right the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day the direction is poor with no consistency it just looks feels bottom of the barrel stuff even the blood gore isn't up to much there's a gory hand severing at the start a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman's stomach a legless woman what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way why didn't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70's early 80's will be very disappointed there aren't any decent feeding scenes no intestines no stand out 'head shots' very little gore at all br br technically the film is poor the special effects are cheap looking the cinematography is dull the music is terrible the locations are bland it has rock bottom production values this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum the entire film is obviously dubbed the acting still looks awful though the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesn't understand the language that well br br zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci's classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 1979 it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash in title i'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film it's boring it makes no sense it's not funny enough to be entertaining it lacks any decent gore one to avoid
<START> i felt compelled to write a review for space cobra as it has received a good score of 7 3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers this is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy space cobra himself is witty and likable i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly you barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience check out if you can
