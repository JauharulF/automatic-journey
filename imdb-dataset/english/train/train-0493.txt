<START> i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite the gameplay is indeed very similar and is very addictive once i'd played it a couple of times i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie it's brilliant if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single player game simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc easy to do and the software is included and play to your heart's content there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening because you don't often meant other players unless you want to so go get a copy of this game learn it by playing the single player campaign then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself the depth of this game is staggering with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find as well as all sorts of other things to discover hidden planets wormholes secret bases the list is nearly endless fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay get one with the full written manual if you can blue box not xplosiv red box it's loads better
<START> an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything it's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates all tied together by a wrap around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starÂand what he does to the inspector it's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget add to that the acting talents of peter cushing christopher lee denholm elliott joss ackland ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again just don't answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countrysideÂ
<START> pointless boring film with charismatic mercurio completely wasted released for a minute on a thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four others back of beyond is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee local actors like john polson and terry serio deserve better well polson has morphed into a director of lame thrillers like swimfan and hide and seek and terry serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles but paul mercurio should have become one of australia's greatest exports on screen roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time
<START> this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century br br this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black etc br br good movie with a good message
<START> i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch stÃ©phane rideau had participate still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful Â«les roseaux sauvagesÂ» in portuguese juncos silvestres by andrÃ© tÃ©chinÃ© i was searching for similar movies in the come of age line i found then Â«presque rienÂ» a movie where the director sÃ©bastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us earning a nomination by the cannes festival in 2000 the story is about two guys the kind Â«boy next doorÂ» mathieu jÃ©rÃ©mie elkaÃ¯m and cÃ©dric stÃ©phane rideau who meet during the summer vacations in a land far from where he lives mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister there he meets cÃ©dric a local with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that stÃ©phane rideau gives his characters in Â«les roseaux sauvagesÂ» 6 years younger he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer witch matures here in experience exemplar in directing in the amorous sequence in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his still ambiguous sexuality and great love the first love in its terrible progression ecstasy despair the best of the film is the best of france the fervent passion the hot and excited rationalism the brownish beauty the simple and natural acceptance made by the families although not without surprise and first anger still there is the beach the luminosity the lightness e simplicity of summer the freshness of breeze the surge 8217 s melody and the expressive eyes of an introverted elkaÃ¯m hesitant hurt puzzled passionate the sex is not avoided nor exploited it is treated as it is with no exhibitionist intention in virtue of pure talent this is a work of drama of uncommon quality without cheap sentimentalism showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person although with a social fear of rejection and shame it is well worthy being seen especially by those who adore french movies although the dvd front cover is very lame with the two actors in between tens of stars greased with brilliantine a movie witch in my opinion deserves an 8 9
<START> don't drink the water is an unbelievably bad film it's based on a 1966 broadway play by woody allen it stars jackie gleason the comic genius behind the honeymooners the director howard morris has appeared in several mel brooks comedies life stinks high anxiety silent movie and has made a mark in animation characters he has voiced include gopher from pooh jughead archie and beetle bailey what went wrong br br i think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively allen's original play was tongue in cheek which is why it worked on broadway and in allen's 1994 remake the screenplay by r s allen and harvey bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play making gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work br br the acting isn't much better gleason does the best he can with the material but he can't save this gleason was a comic genius but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the hustler and soldier in the rain his abrasive personality could have worked here but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance too bad estelle parsons' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes see how soon it'll take for you to want to strangle her that is also a shame because she is also a fine actress having turned in two exceptional performances in bonnie and clyde and rachel rachel none of the other actors do particularly well either br br woody allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and julie kavner marge simpson in the leads they manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece it's finally on video after a long battle over rights do go out and find that version all the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome br br 1 2 out of 4 stars
<START> there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don't see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
<START> the easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire the target of the satire is quite vast from the us government to corporate america it is also not a stinging satire but rather a silly one br br think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie airplane and police squad series done with a much smaller budget and not as funny i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's i see this movie as a big influence on tim burton's mars attacks br br the plot is simple enough genetically engineered giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war br br the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations lois fairchild a lois lane clone a very ambitious presidential press secretary clark kent mason dixon fia agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs a useless president who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york an even inept congress a sleazy marketing ceo and mason's team consisting of an obese east german female swimmer a scuba diver a crazed wwii paratrooper and an african american disguise expert disguised as george washington abraham lincoln hitler and finally as a tomato did i also forget to mention lots and lots of tomatoes there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes to smashed tomatoes to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes br br on top of all this you have a couple of musical numbers as well they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed the best tune is by far the theme of the movie attack of the killer tomatoes it is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public be warned br br most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres i don't believe i was induced to laughter but mostly smiled and scratched my head i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies but only as a rental br br celluloid rehab
<START> i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldn't even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is self consciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this art br br
<START> the creators of south park in their own film here this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor if you like naked gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor you'll love this
<START> i am quite a fan of novelist screenwriter michael chabon his novel wonder boys became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson his masterful novel the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay won the pulitzer prize a few years back and he had a hand in the script of spider man 2 arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time br br director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces such as the gut busting dodgeball and the genius short film series terry tate office linebacker and with a cast including peter saarsgard sienna miller nick nolte and mena suvari this seems like a no brainer br br it is literally br br jon foster stars as art bechstein the son of a mobster nolte who recently graduated with a degree in economics jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum wage job at book barn has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend boss phlox suvari which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion br br one night at a party an ex roommate introduces jon to jane miller a beautiful smart violinist later that night they go out for pie and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul if you do it will make this night indelible jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by yet none of them look him in the eye i imagine it must be what death feels like he says br br the next day jane's wild boyfriend cleveland saarsgard kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill and soon jon cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol this doesn't sit well with phlox who pushes jon for a more personal relationship namely letting her meet his new friends and his father the film then attempts to take us on jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father phlox and his dead end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane br br there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film he's completely uninteresting he has no ambitions passions or goals he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met at the outset this isn't a problem but he never gets any more interesting he's a completely passive character he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself br br consequently the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party have sex and get in arguments in other words much ado about nothing what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside sweeping cinematography ponderous voice over with characters staring off into the distance lots of sex scenes both straight and gay big arguments more angry sex a chase scene and a tragic death but it doesn't seem to matter ironically at one point jane confused at a number of jon's aimless actions asks him what's going on jon what is this all about yes jon do tell we in the audience are dying to know too br br the title the mysteries of pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves because that's what they are they are all facades one dimensional stand ins for actual people the film never lets us in we never know what makes any of them tick we see them do lots of things but we don't know why and the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have
<START> i had the privilege of watching holly at the edinburgh film festival last week what a powerful and moving story holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia patrick an american comes into holly's life and decides he wants to help her when holly is sold again patrick desperately searches for her we follow they're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion br br holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore
<START> this is not a profound movie most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and tried and true but it was well acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret our mistakes as the movie calls them as we look back over our lives i had not read the book so didn't know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn't really shared with anyone thankfully they got a top notch cast meryl br br streep's daughter mamie gummer plays the young lila and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila in addition to an amazing resemblance duh the younger actress did a great job perhaps not quite up to her mom's caliber but who is all others in this film were fine although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic br br this is more of a girls' movie than for the guys but a good one to see with your mom or your daughter and maybe start some dialog going how hard it is to really know a parent as a person
<START> quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans why don't they learn the dixie chicks haven't these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are br br the best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all br br dan akroyd's imitation of cheney was bad br br i would have thought cussack could have landed better movies br br it wasn't funny
<START> i read a couple of good reviews on this board for mr scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of rick's al cliver character the whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of vinchenzo napoli vittorio caprioli but as most other viewers commented he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence i found it somewhat unbelievable that manzari's goons who chased tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them for all of his buildup as the title character jack palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the u s working title mr scarface rather moot i've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they don't all work i guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either
<START> the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant kelly was at his best here it's a little different to singin' in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended 'that's entertainment' after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by
<START> mike hawthorne gordon currie is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father morty jon fedele twenty years later mike gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a halloween party while playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father it is soon discovered that morty's spirit inhabits a wooden indian in the cabin the statue comes to life and the blood bath begins br br most of the f x are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme stale story pitifully acted cast members of note are kelly benson phillip rhys emmanuelle vaugier byron chief moon and veteran actress betsy palmer
<START> a beautiful new print of zabriskie point is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter it's time for a full evaluation of the film let's hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful extras will be out in the near future br br i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a near miss masterpiece the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late '60's los angeles i lived there then and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work br br the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes it is forbidden to those under 16 or 18 i can't remember i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print spoiler i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut what appears today seems rather tame by current standards br br there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts etc antonioni was very daring to do this i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non actors mark frechette and daria halprin this time frechette did not bother me halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues br br much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me one shot is in a different aspect ratio distorted by the wide screen of course there is actual staged footage but not all that much br br i'm still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane it looks like he really did some of the flying there's no blue screen or double in some shots br br i hope to get back to see the film a second time recommended highly to all antonioni fans
<START> how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me i loved this show before i even saw it for 3 reasons 1 the story intrigued me 2 jessica alba and 3 james cameron please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made br br i hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you dark angel fans hate them too they have a thing for canning good shows don't you all agree
<START> i've always been enthusiastic about period dramas an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past this presentation of byron was unbelievable unbelievably bad the script was dreadful the acting uninspired and all the characters woefully insipid apparently byron was mad bad and dangerous to know and set the ladies hearts all a flutter not in this production here he appeared as a tawdry jumped up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence it is said that byron walked with a limp this portrayal of the man was just limp all over br br i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life not a splutter not even a glimmer it was utter tedium if not downright boredom from start to finish br br having the opinion that no one will ever better the bard of avon i also believe that byron's poetry is over revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment br br i think the bbc lost its nous with this one
