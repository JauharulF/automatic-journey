<START> strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark so i had to wait for the video release my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90 s br br people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot corny or braveheart acceptable will be sourly disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it 9 out of 10
<START> the sweet is never as sweet without the sour this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break br br its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it you cannot really appreciate the better things in life the sweet like love until you have experienced the bad the sour the theme will really get you to open your eyes br br only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand i think the end is perfect though i recommend you watch it and see for yourself
<START> steven speilberg's adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women br br this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister br br celie played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celie's life br br the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about love br br speilberg's direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through br br i couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on me br br
<START> cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film the best way i've been able to explain it is that it's quite acidic though it's not totally random the story is about nyatta a young cat boy and his sister nyaako nyaako is very ill and dies however nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it the story is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to life br br though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random it is not most of it is symbolism for life death and rebirth you can also see references from other tales such as hansel and gretal this strangely cute short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen
<START> a poorly written script with no likeable characters as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh it's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them no sex scenes and another friend who is semi discustingly weird who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates the 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman amanda peet somehow this is done without really any romance the 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women a bad movie
<START> no spoilers just plot details i can't understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean now there's a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance i don't say that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace
<START> let's set one thing straight this movie does not seek to redefine the genre it's not dr strangelove o young frankenstein it's a silly flick with three great female leads can't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey charming as ever the story is basic the three gals were losers in college and are still after wards it poehler is a dog trainer who can't even get a date with a blind guy posey is an assistant for a senator who hasn't been touched by a man since clinton was in office i catched that one several minutes later i'm a little slow ok and dracht has a gay fiancÃ©e seth meyers from snl funny they have to prevent the uncool daughter of the senator the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series joan of arcadia to embarrass her during spring break so of course they have to go to watch over her and some hilarity ensues all in all a light simple comedy quite short and quite enjoyable
<START> ok this movie starts out like a cheesy lifetime movie and doesn't get better till almost well through the movie the script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and cast is not well directed for the most part for the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves i do not think this is one of her best acting jobs the only reason i bought the movie is because it was on sale and had ellen burstyn in it she's terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs the story is based on true events and that helps the movie actually i didn't even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when i saw stills of the balloon traveling i mean let it get where it's suppose to go and be done with it but all is forgiven by the time it does reach it's destination and the story comes to a close if this doesn't bring a tear to your eye nothing will it's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again
<START> this would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991 except it got beat out by the brilliant jfk this is such a wonderful movie i loved it i love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives kevin kline is good here but is outshined by danny glover and especially steve martin i've never much like martin or his style but here he is great i loved the whole speech he gave to kline near the end about the grand canyon the writing was excellent larry kasdan is imo a great dialogue writer along the ways of kevin smith and quentin tarantino here he has formed several three dimensional characters and well thought out storylines and messages that give a positive feel to our lives a truly excellent film 4 out of 4 stars
<START> there are other reviews here so i don't need to say how great it is or what it's about my point is i heard about this movie ages ago before it was shown i can't even remember how i just know it was through the internet the distributors went under before it ever hit for months i moped and complained please note that on this page there's a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazon com in germany you can use alta vista's babelfish to translate i know it's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that's also been dubbed in german but as hilarious and campy as this film is it really only makes it funnier if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions it's so worth it it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u s from germany trust me it might seem like a lot to spend on a film but if you're into corny b flicks you'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends
<START> this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end
<START> as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby br br if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight nothing special saturday morning cartoon but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the old scooby and gang i'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series where are you br br scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this let's hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers
<START> the worst thing about crush is not that it's acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually non existent and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better br br no the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come br br but in the end it's too little too late if you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage then by all means don't miss it br br i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it br br the verdict 4 10 guilty of wasting my time br br
<START> i was previously unaware that in the early 1990's devry university or was it itt tech added film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian my friend and i rented the original 1980 boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd do not waste your time with this movie awful awful awful br br the filmmaker adds 2 main character's a woman and her therapist the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his victim's from the first film over 50 of this film is stock from the original movie the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator these scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow they would make angela lansbury look 25 years old so to recap awful don't watch this movie
<START> i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but there's a monster after you br br it was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually good br br and that's what separated jake's closet from the usual indy film pabulum an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clichÃ©s of both br br if it's not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd
<START> my brother and i have pokemon 4ever on dvd we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time i'll get used to it br br the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control br br there was only one song in the ending credits called cele b r a t e performed by russell velazquez br br pokemon 4ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film
<START> race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you've driven 150 and 150 mph seems fast till you've driven 250 br br ok br br andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen eraserhead and eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen begotten br br and begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen the works of c frederic hobbs race fans there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c frederic hobbs br br alabama's ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot and it only involves hippies rock concerts voodoo ghosts vampires robots magicians corrupt multinational corporations elephants and mystery gas and the fabulous woodmobile cruising the sunset district in san francisco of course br br what's really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make alabama's ghost there's sets lighting hundreds of extras costumes lots and lots of effects somehow that makes alabama's ghost so wrong you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover cards but alabama's ghost was made with an actual budget and that's evil i mean i've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay ontario building a secret temple in the woods out of twizzlers and nobody's beating down my door waving a checkbook how did this guy get the funds for four of the flakiest movies ever made
<START> this isn't the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable it's directed in an old fashioned way and that works fine cybill shepherd as corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death she has a sexy maturity but i can't say much for ryan o'neal as philip because he is at best nondescript he may be adequate in the role but that's not good enough br br however i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough in depth thought we don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh as a daisy sweetness to brighten it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he melts the screen even his smile is infectious and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes br br anyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a try br br
<START> bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her 1979 movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums
<START> tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about druids what they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers br br if i had to sum up evil breed it would be a low grade gore fest the film mixes dead alive evil dead wrong turn all in one it's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any fun one would have watching it the film has lots of random horror nudity although the film also stars four porn stars yup four so there could have been plenty more breed also showcases a good amount of gore br br evil breed has a horrible start with laughable dialogue and horrible acting that's a given in a straight to video horror film but this takes the cake i can't really figure out who the main character is since the one female who lives at the end is not really in the movie all that much speaking of the ending that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one's view of the film br br you have to see this film to believe it since there are some pretty great death scenes there are two death scenes that come into my mind one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest yea her chest don't ask me the other id when the guy gets his intestines yet again ripped out through his asshole does that kill the guy no the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines these scenes remind me so much of dead alive with the right amount of humour in each i also got the sense of evil dead with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam raimi along with halloween when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately y to get in br br although the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots distracting indeed as well as the continuity in the film with only one inbred killer as well as which character dies at which moment i couldn't tell if the breast implant chick was jenny or gary's sister cousin i can't remember as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body still attached with the umbilical cord br br the horrible editing is distracting as well the opening credits are too fast and disorienting it did have a bad start and got better but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film then it wouldn't have been horribly butchered to death stay away from this film unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore
