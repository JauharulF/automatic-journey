<START> one of the worst films ever not funny poor tv style cinematography bad acting sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk let alone act lead female nancy young can't act terrible direction sub par with bad tv movies occasional weak jokes fall flat even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny how did they even get the money to make this
<START> the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesn't degrade but the movie fails to get on with it instead it pads for 45 minutes noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out it's a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs and blue collar co workers want the invention squelched leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements inventing the chemical and running from oppressors br br i can't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy the tone isn't funny or comical it's more like serious social criticism of the day that capitalism warps both supply chains and production which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world yes that's probably true but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact the movie is simply an earnest argument you'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here br br this is more like a british meet john doe meet nigel doe
<START> according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea audie murphy and randolph scott the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost hadn't been seen in years br br good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland br br george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque cleveland is more than just a business owner he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair he even has the sheriff in his pocket br br randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing that includes not backing relatives up when they're villains he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig br br cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals barbara's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda br br randolph scott's original home studio was paramount it was where his first studio contract was with albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one br br note also lon chaney jr who is george cleveland's chief henchman a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes who is just gabby hayes br br albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque i'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to br br still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market
<START> deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this universal film from 1936 which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it's a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father winninger is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper nanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their father's accountant king the man he chooses is a full time drunk auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess br br this is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer in fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings a delightful il bacio in a police station br br one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by charles winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the gold digger isn't all that young but the girls' mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters br br universal gives durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is br br very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna
<START> this is a movie about animal cruelty under the guise of a marathon race we see depictions of extreme animal abuse including literally running a horse to death in slow motion the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial burning of the horse which of course is still dead having been tortured to death this is one of the sickest slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race i'll decide when they're finished probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing
<START> townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be it's not funny enough for comedy it's not tragic enough for drama it's not bloody enough for horror and it's not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstick bloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part i'm speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a waist of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne aren't the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this day br br if you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like townies br br 1 2 out of br br
<START> those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money unfortunately the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently tearing his life apart there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and of course the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time the middle part is a bit dull but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie also they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it i was not disappointed
<START> ah winter kills based on the novel by richard condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the united states 20 years ago i knew condon also wrote the manchurian candidate which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller br br winter kills left me cold it's not a thriller it's a piece of worthless crap possibly the worst movie i've seen this month and boy have i seen a lot of bad movies in june the problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as william richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce br br there's two things wrong with this movie first off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner it's not as ott as say something like that james bond movie with david niven and peter sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances this might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none as a satire it's very silly so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called dawson dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane the scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason br br a dire movie that's an ordeal to sit through
<START> it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs fox field and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance sassy and shadow and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing br br i have seen this movie 72 times already i know that sounds scary but it's true and every time the ending scenes still get me i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers it is indeed my all time favorite movie
<START> i have seen this movie many times and recently read the book the movie is based on and every time i see it i just want to slap all four of them the fact that they don't clue in to the fact that tom hank's character is flipping into his d d oops m m persona oh he's just acting in character outside of the gaming session that and the fact that after three months of therapy let's just destroy all that and feed his delusions these kind of people are what give rpgs a bad name br br also the corny 'love ballad' and the music done by 'cat on a piano' and 'stop us if we get too annoying' are almost enough to set your teeth on edge
<START> this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera sound film sets music costumes but drum roll gary stretch spoke i don't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script but would say it was both considering the casting of him in this role i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end i wished he'd have died in battle or one of the sword knife scuffles br br then the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his queen pretty lame and to go to the extreme to kill her own son and to then push up her lover as succeeding king i see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical br br i don't recognize gary stretch from anything else but he was dreadful i read another user's comments about audio being dubbed but don't think his was dubbed after all he speaks english right it really was awful the lines were read right off the coroner's table flat line it could be he just doesn't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations br br aside from this i did watch it to the end so the movie had at least an interest it could have been more if the script lines and casting had been given more work the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else the cast and story were all secondary i give the film crew a 10
<START> kay pollak's 2004 heart warmer sÃ¥ som i himmelen as it is in heaven contains every stereotype of swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowd pleaser it contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics continuity error spotters and for saccharine debunkers yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community evocatively the film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about 'finding one's own voice' and 'just doing it despite one's fear' without completely removing the lump from the throats of the cynics br br its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts firstly small films about strangers bringing new life to rural christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their hairshirts the same year and with a similarly swedish breeze the queen of sheba's pearls did it and babette's feast also comes to mind secondly any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individual self focused and impersonalized world this film's structural similarity with the likes of the full monty brassed off calendar girls and on a clear day shows its indebtedness to the formula but it is a formula with life left in it yet and this seems to be because people need positive message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves br br the stranger is burned out maestro daniel darÃ©us on a quest for self rediscovery the town he visits or rather revisits is unbeknownst to the townsfolk the place of his childhood he was bullied mercilessly by classmates here supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck here he takes the job of cantor choirmaster despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders the place is of course populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted the broken hearted fair haired girl so beautiful she nearly glows the cellphone ringing local businessman the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse the steely pastor and his less austere wife who at first seem right out of ingmar bergman also present jealous uptight spinster siv check geriatric whose soul still sings check elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten check obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say 'fatty' check intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good 'a' check br br pollak's film is not all warm fuzzies however it diverts from the 'let's put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition' sub genre it contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative nirvana the violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife beater is like this similarly the small town pastor so closely adheres to the moralistic black wearing super protestant stereotype that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising his repressions and hypocrisies are just there dangling unrelated to psychological reality perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy a lost son perhaps glimpsed once over his shoulder holds the secret br br perhaps these holes are functions of the editing like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted such as siv's unexplained reappearance in the choir twice after moralistic outbursts in fact none of the hitches in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene apart from in some awkward love scenes the film's 127 minutes seldom drag but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floor br br the film remains solid three star fare despite the holes that can be picked in it this is simply because in a world of technology focused flicks and materialistic self seeking any glimpse of human community is deep down welcome for anyone even the cynical
<START> the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's created concept that comic books could only be done as camp i e the 60's batman show for tv and movie thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a cluelessly unromantic doc savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps not an idiot monk mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute and when they're not doing booming sousa march scores the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama br br even as such this movie is okay it's fun and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps except for monk as has been mentioned before he's hugely muscled not obese and long tom who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude not paul gleason with an inexplicable scarf br br the green death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children but they are very close to the feel of the pulps when the writers and producers get it right they do get it right i'll give them that br br but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of say reeves' first two superman movies think what we might have had then i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage but they're also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that batman created one gets the impression there was a sober pulp style first draft and then someone came in and said hey let's make it funny it worked with the batman show 8 years ago br br but doc lives on thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai if macrauch ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie the man is truly demented so when the series actually gets on tv allegedly mid season in '99 00 doc savage updated to the 90's will live once more
<START> this movie is so wonderful it's hard to find words to describe it this is the only time i can't decide which was better the book or the movie br br whoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up 9 10
<START> first of all i liked very much the central idea of locating the '' intruders'' others in the fragile self on various levels mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film in the swiss french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past br br the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and guilts sense of failure being more or less dominant this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly self dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize
<START> hello i was alanrickmaniac i'm a still crazy holic it was just another movie i watched partly on tv then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends then i wanted the dvd because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack then on several film posters and the film script right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties br br how could that happen what drove me into addiction br br ok it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce br br alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''this is spinal tap'' because of the characters that aren't childish or ultra cool but real this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or don't it contains some of the best actors possible tim spall stephen rea bruce robinson jimmy nail and bill nighy bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film br br good the soundtrack is unbelievable foreigner's mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit jimmy nail who plays bass man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing we know that about jimmy nail but if you've only heard bill nighy's singing in love actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is br br well you'll fever for every scene to come for the x th time especially those concert scenes you'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing all over the world singing on the top of your lungs you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech's festival stage br br it's hard but i'm addicted to this film i'm addicted to strange fruit if there's a world where this band really exists i'd like to move there br br got still crazy anyone
<START> a patchwork about 911 the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic sometimes boring the first one for example sometimes used to say to americans we have had more deaths than you and you supported the murderers sometimes really weird but highly symbolic and interesting i really loved the claude lelouch personal live of a couple in new york showing that our day to day problems are unimportant shoei imamura bizarre strongly anti wars in general and idrissa ouedraogo funny typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery and youssef chahine an egyptian intellectual pro peace having moral difficulties to accept the u s policy towards arab countries i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie it shows that we or they i am still belgian but living in texas for 12 years are still interested by other cultures and able to question past and present actions of our government like we should in a democracy
<START> directed by samuel fuller who also wrote the screenplay pickup on south street is a tough brutal well made film about a pickpocket richard widmark who inadvertently aquires top secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex lover richard kiley it's film noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties and who also sells information she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won this should have been the role that copped it for her
<START> creepshow 2 had a lot of potential they just didn't put enough time in perfecting it the stories were pretty cool and creepy enough but it was lacking it's a good movie but after you've seen it once you might want to see it again this movie could of been better
<START> excellent gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place a moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences low budget independent film never made any money definitely not the romanticized unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life
