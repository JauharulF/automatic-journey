<START> i actually like asylum movies i've made it a habit to see as many as possible even the rip offs they've done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and dracula's curse actually made this movie too it's not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate and or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now that's a movie i can't wait to see
<START> i'm kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i can't really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either br br the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling almost the entire film is comprised of re enactments of some of bettie's more famous photo shoots and loops these re enactments take up literally 75 of the films run time and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much glossed over in favor of showing long and drawn out re enactment scenes br br dark angel isn't a horrible film there's just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots up close it's a no go the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within it's limitations so no gripes from me there the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved in fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter no joke check the cast list can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway 4 10
<START> truly this is a 'heart warming' film it won the george peobody award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father in law eugene logan the co writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great grandsons my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i won't 'spoil' this movie for you
<START> this first installment of crispin glover's personal magnum opus asks you to think a little and so can't be recommended for any viewer who doesn't want to sit and puzzle over glover's imagery or follow the surprisingly simpleÂbut weirdly obfuscatedÂthread of his narrative to the more casual viewer yes it's probably going to come off as a confusing mish mash of odd startling and disturbing imagery for imagery's sake br br you get the sense that glover doesn't mind that this is the case and he'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it glover's innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented br br the easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as dada or nihilist a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who's worked both without and within but there's a reason why glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie and it's not only to sell books his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that glover pieced together and what is it does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture br br what is it is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing much has already been made about glover's use of actors with down's syndrome and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film so jarring in fact that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far reaching crusade to see a more realistic and or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionÂor on the absolute other end of the spectrum as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled but it's not either and maybe that's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness it's not a film about down's syndrome but it is a film that is owned by the actors with down's syndrome who appear in it br br i'm the sort of person who is entirely gung ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful happily for me this is pretty much exactly how what is it presents itself to viewers glover uses the strange images of snails death and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail in some ways the weirdly compelling and occasionally downright grotesque elements of what is it remind me of the work of the painter francis baconÂ he of the infamous popes yes and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away like bacon's paintings glover's film manages to be opulent and humble grainy and polished chaotic and well realizedÂ and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting but still this is not an entirely serious film and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that for the most part derives from the use and juxtaposition of familiar items images and names of popular culture and when what is it is funny it is very funny br br overall what is it is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that isn't exactly good or bad but just strangeÂ and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up if that's the kind of art you enjoy what is it is likely to exceed your expectations and be well worth the effort of catching it in the theatre along with the big slide show and glover himself all in all it's an experience you're unlikely to forget any time soon
<START> i'm not a fan of the left behind book series the books are written at a 6th grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science technology and politics while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the russian arab invasion of israel also the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel still i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation for a similar reason i watched this film adaptation i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over acting the script is rather bad though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped events feel scattered and disconnected the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory here the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded the music is schizophrenic at times it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture at other moments it reminds me of sitcom and mini series music and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane but that's it the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling the film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face in all i found the movie just as disappointing as the series this is not the film to rally christians around it i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity for an example of a compelling intelligent well researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur it's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality
<START> i don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasn't the poor acting very poor casting sean astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guy's completely generic and sub standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you'll like this movie but if you're a vonnegut fan or not completely insane don't see it please
<START> the thief of bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar conrad veidt he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad and a gorgeous princess from her father br br he falls victim in the end as all tyrants do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored here embodied by the little thief sabu br br the armies of good and evil black and white are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms br br the script is poetic simply and very beautiful the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror br br the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues br br for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before while through its use of color it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before br br with flying carpet and flying white horse with a giant genie excellently played by rex ingram with evil wizards and with the good acting of sabu and veidt the thief of bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights br br the 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale
<START> an archaeologist casper van dien stumbles accidentally upon an ancient 40 foot mummy well preserved underground in the nevada desert they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it the mummy as explained at the beginning is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days in order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything he mummifies his son burying him with several servants for centuries planning to awaken him years from then in our present the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place most of the movie is slow having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy air punching fights the mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough it should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so eh don't bother
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits br br mike atherton dudikoff is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady being a gentleman he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner br br m dudikoff is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday the human shield it was just another dud ha ha added to the list but i have a thing for westerns being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts as his films go anyway br br the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast along with the obligatory cheap looking sets but if for some strange reason your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film this would be one of your best choices
<START> the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical innacuracies are not i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it br br abbu abas was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph in order to free 50 terrorists from israeli prisons one of which was samir kuntar a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for klinghoffer samir kuntar on google abbu abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations even if he never set foot on the achile lauro ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the wtc did he br br possible spoilers br br the movie almost excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always accentuating and exaggerating how much the israeli's have done to hurt them however they never portray the hurt that the palestinians have ever caused to the israelis the movie uses quite horrid images from the sabra and chatila horror and nothing is said understating the general belief that it was israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a syrian les lebanese army who conducted the massacre br br the acting was generally very bad but i guess that's what can be expected from opera singers br br on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is wink wink
<START> aileen gonsalves my girlfriend is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank she has a lovely scene with roshan seth in a restaurant there's more information on her website at having stated my personal interest in the film i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie moving funny and beautifully filmed
<START> why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead for goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are aussie b grade celebs not actors people like john michael 'hollywood' howson the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice over guy in countdown but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad even for a self confessed b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has 'realism' anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made
<START> another trashy grade z quickie from the prolific albert pyun tim thomersonÂ´s 13 inch clint eastwood like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head to earth and gets involved in a gang war in south bronx mercifully short but deadeningly dull with the cheesiest effects since attack of the 50ft woman they should have fired the continuity guy too note how thomersonÂ´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot laughably bad but thatÂ´s why we watch these movies ainÂ´t it sequel Â´dollman vs demonic toysÂ´ is reportedly even worse if thatÂ´s possible br br 0 of br br
<START> if you are a crispin glover fan you must see this if you are a sean penn fan you must see this if you are a movie fan in general you must see this if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is this film will probably still have a lot of value but the more work you've previously seen by crispin or sean the better br br this movie is so funny but it is also pure genius there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film it is its own genre i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that br br in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review i ask that you view the film again in reality there is no point at which this film could fairly be called boring this is possibly the funniest most entertaining and least boring film ever made and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings a timeless classic that unfortunately very few will be able to claim to have seen br br beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed which crispin glover also stars in br br unfortunately copies of this film are rare and hard to find i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd
<START> what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated both bustling cities known for excitement haute couture and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency david morrisey derailed plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama humor tension all of the basic instincts mind bending throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen
<START> was the script more fitting for a 30 minute sitcom yes but they still make it work i thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script especially jack black and christopher walken most people on the board seem to really hate this film i personally can't see how that could be but envy is just one of those film that you either love it or hate it much like napoleon dynamite and every leslie neilsen movie ever made you either think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest don't avoid this movie because of the reviews watch it and see if you're one of the ones who really like it if you do i guarantee it's worth your money if you don't like it well now you know
<START> oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it's used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that's not the only thing that's used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off br br ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i'll usually point them out so let's just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn't like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i've witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let's get on with it br br in cliff notes version here's the story don't worry i'll try not to give anything away br br a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits br br as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what's with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what's with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top br br it's funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it's sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper's crocodile was good blood surf sucked br br my grade d
<START> one used to say concerning nathaniel hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald eddy's pictures and especially this one br br it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie it's kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistentÂ yet this movie gets also some good points good rodgers hart's music i married an angel tira tira tira la good acting with e e horton and reginald owen br br anyway if you may dislike it you can't forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didn't have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dream movies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerful br br in short let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream
<START> when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 br br the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate br br if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more br br if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won't regret it br br
<START> i am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad first of all it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving funny moments in the beginning br br but that's hardly important the film is simply boring unmoving and not true to the original story it simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points orwell tried to make to his book br br spoiler br br second revolution haven't they guys learned anything who be the next napoleon then benjamin
