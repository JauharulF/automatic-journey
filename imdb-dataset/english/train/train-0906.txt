<START> this movie was okay but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman it almost seems as if kate's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch making this film seem a little simplistic br br also as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots and there was no happy medium it was either kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her this is not typical of interactions between gay and non gay relatives and friends it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make sadly the movie showed none of these types of interactions for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance it struck me as very intolerant movie then at the end kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory is that what being gay is really all about come on
<START> anthony mann's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart in mann's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance here it is a i trust only myself attitude which leads to one complication after another even before the film properly begins he as jeff webster kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute we never are clear about it either they wanted to leave the cattle drive or they tried to steal the cattle br br he meets his match in skagway the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson skagway's boss is a so called law man named gannon john mcintyre who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the gold rush jefferson soapy smith and judge roy bean the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging so as a penalty fine the herd is confiscated to be sold later for gannon's profit br br stewart is partner with ben walter brennan who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean they are also joined by rube morris jay c flippen and also meet two women the sophisticated rhonda castle ruth roman and the friendly and helpful renee vallon corinne calvert rhonda works closely with gannon but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle however she has a similar i only trust myself attitude to jeff she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson he ben and rube go but at night while the others are asleep they go back and steal back their cattle renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him br br the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson jeff opting for a longer and safer route after he is proved right they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields the herd is sold to rhonda and jeff ben rube and renee start prospecting there is soon two groups in the town of dawson one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town but the mounties won't be setting up a station in dawson for months the other centering around the dancehall run by rhonda are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers robert j wilke really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c flippen jack elam and harry morgan jeff wishes to steer clear of both and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah but will they get there and will jeff remain neutral br br the performances are dandy here including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers but would otherwise be peaceful enough brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results flippen is a drunk at first but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond but his work in mann's films show his abilities as a villain such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73 he is as is said elsewhere on this thread really sleazy but he has a sense of humor roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being whose fate is determined by her better feelings and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier gigi aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman br br best of all is the canadian rockies background as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film and the viewer will appreciate the results
<START> i didn't know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of 20 at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes she made a wise decision
<START> this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee dean jagger macdonald carey lew ayres solid b movie actors all but this downer of a movie didn't use any of them to any sort of advantage with none of their characters even meeting on screen though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes br br the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat first they just want to repair their ship and leave then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need then out of nowhere this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society br br most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end just in vengeance for boring us to death br br unless you really like chris lee or seventies low budget sci fi i'd give this one a miss it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo target earth
<START> this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth in order to create a gay universe br br i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made 50 years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw droppingly embarrassing br br one has to be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from denmark i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film
<START> as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school i thought i would add my comments seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film the characters have so many complexities everyone can relate to them in their own way the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters rather than being spoon fed an opinion you can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life i'd highly recommend it
<START> it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography i'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a b movie hardly worth your money vote 4 10
<START> yay i think it's hard to say it's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary life sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst 3k br br not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
<START> this movie is terrible the suspense is spent waiting for a point there isn't much of one br br aside from a few great lines i found a tooth in my apartment and the main characters dedication to killing himself it's a collection of supposedly eerie sounds br br
<START> i am going to keep this short this adaption of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top 250 br br jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall the story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes br br my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series br br oh and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is not a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut
<START> i absolutely adore the 'toxic avenger' series but this weak offering by the troma people didn't make any sense and it had me yawning all the time br br a leaking nuclear plant and the growing weed next to it makes the youngsters of tromaville high go nuts which causes them to join a gang have sex explode and whatever also there's some sort of monster breeding in the high school my god this movie's a mess br br the actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should the intended overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes br br disappointing 2 10
<START> this was excellent touching action packed and perfect for kurt russel i loved this movie it deserves more than 5 3 or so stars this movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend i cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid the ending wasn't twisty but it was still excellent if you like escape from new york or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you not an undue amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect something for everyone
<START> despite much style flash and glitter this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters br br people break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets look hopelessly studio bound br br to be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multi talented cast in so feeble a final effort br br goes to show i guess where followups in this case to the great classic umbrellas often do go awry one cannot recapture only recreate
<START> a lot of the comments people have made strike me as sorry missing the point kasdan wants to present life simply ordinary life the conventionally structured story where characters have insights that change their lives and then fade out music up and the film is over is absorbed into this much larger canvas several characters in this movie have just such illuminations and then they move on sometimes they can hold onto their insights sometimes they can't and that's the way life really is in other words kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life Â there is no happy ending only an eventual ending and everything before that is still in process still always up for grabs Â and if you absolutely insist on a theme an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives what is a miracle well life itself for a start then add in all the random incidents and cross connections that make up a life or several interconnected lives and you have miracles by the bucketful kasdan underscores this theme lightly rather than insisting on it and bolsters it in various ways most memorably by the device right in the center of the film of having mac and his wife lying in bed each dreaming their own dreams but as well showing later on in the film how those dreams have the power within the film to shape reality this is not a film with an easy or obvious message you just have to let it play out in front of you and then let it sit in your mind for a few days a month a few years and see what it has wrought there this is without a doubt kasdan's best film his most mature his most humane a major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors the tragedy is of course that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now mostly due to studio constraints around dreamcatcher hopefully we haven't heard the last from larry kasdan a great film from a great artist keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed
<START> ambushed is no ordinary action flick it's much to bad to be ordinary one man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing the other man fires one round and fells the man with the greater fire power without so much as a nick from the hail of lead raining down on him guess which one is the good guy duh such is ambushed through and through not a good action flick not a good drama not a good movie ambushed fails on all levels with it's cast of b movie veterans mechanically going through the motions almost as though they know they're making a real loser not recommended for anyone br br
<START> i picked up tran scan from the library and brought it home we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like the film was a total waste of time if i went out to buy it i would call it tran scam when i saw that it costs 49 br br the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed br br there was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery to make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min oh yes the case said it was in stereo the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound thet could of at least put some music to it br br if you want a good cross canada film watch the railrodder national film board of canada starring buster keaton the one of the last film he made in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in nova scotia and travels to british columbia
<START> i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming of age movie about a fairly atypical girl this is parminder nagra er 's breakout role playing jess a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football that's soccer to us north americans and even though she's actually much older than her character she plays the role pitch perfect br br this is a movie about friendship specifically jess's friendship with jules keira knightley her teammate who is also going through family issues especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes and who wants jules to be more feminine wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams they also unfortunately both love the same man joe their coach played by jonathan rhys meyers the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship br br in some spots bend it like beckham falls into clichÃ©s in others scenes drag on far too long and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing br br but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up culture clash and the love of football it's about female empowerment chasing your dreams and supporting your friends funny charming and fun bend it like beckham is the little film that could and did br br excellent 8 10
<START> ulli lommel's 1980 film 'the boogey man' is no classic but it's an above average low budget chiller that's worth a look the sequel 1983s 'boogey man ii' is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled 'return of the boogey man ' when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for it i should have known better though the opening title is 'boogey man 3 ' this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anyway br br pros ha that's a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung let's see it has footage from 'the boogey man' and um it's mercifully short yeah that's about it br br cons where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna love's character was named lacey not natalie and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre br br final thoughts the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves it's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked but instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film br br my rating 1 5
<START> a young cat tries to steal back his brothers soul from death but only gets half of it and then has to go adventuring to get the other half or maybe not br br frankly i'm not sure what happens in this film which is full of very strange very surreal images some of which parents might find disturbing ie the cats slicing off part of a pig who is traveling with them and the frying it like bacon which all three eat br br this is a very strange film that some have likened to hello kitty on acid i think its more like hello kitty as done by dali certainly this is more alive than destino which was directly based on his work br br if your up for a very off beat film that will challenge your perceptions of things then see this movie just be ready for some very strange images that will be burned into your memory forever br br
<START> after highlander 2 which i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original wargames however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting isn't even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i don't care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can't turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life
