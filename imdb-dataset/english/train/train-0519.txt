<START> good deaths good mask cool axe good looking girls but watch out no plot and little scares completely lower it's standards they tried to make an i know what you did last summer but ended up making a scream but hey what do people expect from a horror movie answers totally vary rent it if you want but i regret ever seeing it
<START> i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the street' late in the show's run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt giardello yaphet kotto now a candidate for mayor of baltimore is shot the series' cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie br br vote 9
<START> i don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kung fu fighting frightner but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since candyman so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesn't care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun
<START> audrey i know you truly cherish your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books br br it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you
<START> perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of b movie was explained but what i just saw was ridiculous you want a good synopsis of this movie take aliens replace the xenomorphs with vampires then remove everything that was good about it and that's pretty much it br br 5 minutes into the movie the v san squad that's the dumbest acronym i've ever heard checks out a base thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down down what a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background when is this supposed to take place 2210 okay hold on i'll get back to that br br yeah the characters wow well there's the token lesbian asian chick the redneck cowboy wannabe the weathered captain the goth vampire hot topic part time cashier and the wussy noob second in command all of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition it almost pained me to see micheal ironside in this flick isn't he getting enough money being the voice of sam fisher in splinter cell pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it is br br watching this afterbirth of a film the only amusement i got was from the feeble attempts at set making since when does taping pci computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship the money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use
<START> i'm not saying that just as a chris rock fan i'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it's everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it's better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you'll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie br br overall 7 out of 10
<START> the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forth br br in the most nauseating scene the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick re creations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably won't find anything special
<START> i am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them and none of the halloween s or friday the thirteenth s but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore and i'm pretty sure this isn't scary br br what's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots so there's no real surprise in any of this film not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but br br the plot concerns claus von bulow's third cousin john hudson who marries a donna reed look a like peggey webber giving one of the worst performances ever who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ooooh wonder who did it br br this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and or drive their wife insane if you want to see a well done version of this stuff try reversal of fortune and btw jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudson br br the msting was okay but nothing special paired with the gumby short however it makes for good viewing br br two stars for the screaming skull eight stars for the mst3k version br br and now to paraphrase mr von bulow himself how bad is this film you have no idea
<START> as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film i found this to be a very disappointing movie br br yes it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise however it fails abysmally in the important areas br br there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries possibly in free computers or possibly not vague long winded and inconclusive the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical the film feels half finished br br suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher maria doyle kennedy can be drawn to gordon sinclair's unimpressive character especially when he fends off her advances laughable it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value br br not many films leave me feeling cheated but i felt my time was stolen
<START> jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in eroticism excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a one note plot br br the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law's character and a dogged homicide detective well played by timothy spall but despite their best efforts both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality br br with a lesser actor in the lead role and without the benefit of oliver curtis's cinematography crocodiles would blend into the sea of low budget vampire quickies
<START> the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times br br it may sound weak and clichÃ© but it's true you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times br br the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie br br watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential br br 4 10
<START> sheesh what a dreadful movie dodgy camera work a script with more corn than kellogg's and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it br br to cap it all it doesn't know which audience to aim at we have cornel wilde or is that corny wilde getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette dear oh dear and in another awkward scene we have the baddie lobo forcing his ahem if you will 'male friend' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini try explaining that one to the kids br br throw in an overly contrived treasure island cum jaws type storyline and the result is a film so unintentionally funny it's enjoyable i shouldn't expect a special edition dvd any time soon though
<START> atlantis the lost empire has some of the best smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes i especially love don novello's voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist which atlantis doesn't provide he's average at best halfway through the movie there's a mediocre twist that's all it's a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out
<START> after eagerly waiting to the end i have to say i wish i wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place the final episode was everything against the previous seven years it has ruined everything the journey was 23 years but captain janeway has the power to reduce it let say seven years only why seven why not just one or nothing why not avoid the whole adventure crewmemebers were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only the others don't count or what the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing returning to the normal life br br worst ending ever
<START> cut is a film about some film students making a film it's very much in the scream mold an ironic self referential horror flick which for me at least falls down because for all its irony it's still just a bad horror film same as the films its referring to br br but it was not without its charms well one charm anyway molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act although everyone involved with cut says she was lovely to work with br br seriously every scene of her pouting sulking or snapping was great everyone else however wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden br br anyway cut has some laughs a few buckets of gore some of it surprisingly gruesome and ultimately is just another bad horror film
<START> historically accurate hmm perhaps if you squint and light falls upon the subject just so but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal patchy and inconsistent plot reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion the principal characters are merely characterizations embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' american indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' british officers a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history i want my money back
<START> i am totally addicted to this show i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing it's a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove simon rex is the best actor on the show it is suspenseful and exciting i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show i am really mean it
<START> firstly i won't tell you why i rented this movie as i'm still confused myself br br air rage is much like any movie i've seen where a plane is hijacked there is of course that one important person on the plane and the hijacker looking for revenge the sad thing is some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly br br although it's ice t who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while he's not busy putting the c back in front of rap who is glorified on the cover the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' overlooked by the five hijackers which naturally comes back to haunt them as for the rest of the cast the only person i managed to recognize was steve hytner more commonly known as kenny bania from seinfeld br br i can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie when a hijacker used about a pound of plastique to blow a lock off a door brilliant br br the plot was unnaturally predictable br br the script atrocious it got to the point where i could say something which i felt would make a stupid comment and it would be the next line in the movie br br as for special effects the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutes br br and the title the movie did take place in the air but due to the less than stellar performances the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer br br so if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie just because it's bad please save yourself don't choose this
<START> arguably this is a very good sequel better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians it has good dogs good actors good jokes and all right slapstick br br cruella devil who has had some rather major therapy is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them many including chloe simon owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill do not believe this others like kevin shepherd owner of 2nd chance dog shelter believe that she has changed br br meanwhile dipstick with his mate have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies little dipper domino and oddball br br starring eric idle as waddlesworth the hilarious macaw glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt another baddie the name should give a clue this is a good family film with excitement and lots more one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick but not quite as excessive as the last film this is also funnier than the last film br br enjoy 102 dalmatians
<START> this movie was disappointing it was incomplete and dull while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just prosecutor not to mention executive producer the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path br br sure nobody wants to defend the nazi's point of view but that was the point of the nuremberg trails four hours of simply bashing on the nazi's c'mon thats been done already br br i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim bassinger's husband br br right after the movie ended tnt showed the 1959 movie trail at nuremberg that movie is far superior
