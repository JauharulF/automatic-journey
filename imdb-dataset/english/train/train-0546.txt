<START> there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee carl franklin billy dukes denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry then there are the wayans brothers who at one time 15 years ago had an extremely funny television show'in living colour' that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags toilet humour as the standard operating procedure people are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man' they couldn't possibly be a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands darryl's back oh yea that is just hilarious as a master criminal 'little man' is the stupidest on planet earth he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her co star chazz palminteri why chazz offers the best line i'm surrounded by morons based without credit on a chuck jones cartoon baby buggy bunny this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night prior to the bat awards and he did not even mention this dreadful movie when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood
<START> after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival i couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy jim mckay gave a talk q a about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities women non whites working on resolving controversial issues teen pregnancy teen motherhood racial identity single mother households and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid thirties white male the multi racial multi gendered audience of mostly adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of real teen life most of the teens however had left the building leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because it's about them hence distribution questions how do we get our hands on it the internet retail would be a great path this is a film that will be buried like pups or other radical modern teen films and mckay seemed responsive as for his credits as a writer director mckay was extremeley sensitive and detailed in his work allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be with the results being disarmingly realistic
<START> a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus she refuses him but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it starts a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic br br in short a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film and imo it succeeds at being a nice film it's no masterpiece but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is even with the superhero thing going believable br br so thin story but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time br br 7 out of 10 broken hearts
<START> this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to redline the only thing about this movie that was a level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at best and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and while it was pretty bad it could have been worse and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all don't pay for it don't go out of your way to see it but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on it's a decent distraction
<START> let's bowl started out on local television in the twin cities it came on late at night something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of hamm's br br even the ads were locally produced featuring wally outside grumpy's bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously ahh over to you steve sedahl not sure why but that one always made me laugh br br there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips sedahl played it straight counter balanced by rich kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious wally hotvedt highlights included segments like how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball chuck them into a lake and tips on dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint i could have done that myself br br another segment what the duo did on their days off featured steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylor's falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over sized headphones hilarious br br wally's awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights br br let's bowl was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ernie the pig butch etc were more distractions than anything else the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced even jon stewart dissed let's bowl on the daily show not enough lame snide jokes an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better br br how often does a let's bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap the networks have the total crap part down cold but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like let's bowl br br here's hoping they'll put it out on dvd
<START> i'll come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good way br br but i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointed br br the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i won't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism br br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought provoking moments br br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
<START> this romantic comedy isn't too bad there are some funny things happening here and there and there are some rather memorable characters in it br br the acting however is amateurish with the exception of the banker while some scenes are great fun others are simply embarrassing in particular i found the romantic part of the story poor br br all in all i guess it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies it's not really a bad movie and the ending did feel quite good just don't expect anything out of the ordinary fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill
<START> during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for it's pirate connections when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now
<START> i love the series many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent but such people do exist all too frequently the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well some things never change and we see the good old boys every day there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen and the storybook po' white trash are all too familiar aside from the supernatural elements everything else could very well happen in the modern south i somehow think trinity sc must have been in barnwell county
<START> i found this movie to be very funny i loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports this movie is not as funny as south park but it is pretty funny and since i am a sports fan i loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports this movie is great for non sports lovers too probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing i also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs for the person shooting overall i highly recommend you see this movie and believe that you will end up loving this movie however if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it but that is with any comedy movie
<START> the rating is only a 5 because it's a movie that could have used better acting and direction or at least music however for the achievements of walt whitman it deserves a 10 a previous poster calls the movie cheesy however i think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees the film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a hollywood shiny feature film and for this i applaud them the fact it is non mainstream reflects the life of whitman as well this film is more documentary than for the sake of acting to be fascinated with a story such as this when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health is the most important thing i found it a highly enjoyable look at history
<START> whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
<START> one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote do you believe in love at first site br br a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture further catapulting the films flawless integrity gabby aka joey played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography lol br br the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment which i may add was acted to perfection james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm cut throat mafia this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming br br personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future thats if i can find it anywhere lol
<START> i argued with myself whether to rent this or not i'm always afraid of renting something i've never heard of don't remember this being in theaters great cast that's what tipped the scales 30 minutes in i almost stopped watching it the first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable it only gets worse after that the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable i give it a 3 a 1 for the writing only because there are words and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script oh my god this movie sucks
<START> if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non communication and false ideals then this is the film for you if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere there are many films that do this far better for example try some of the darker films by bergman the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours like cleaning your house for example
<START> this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3
<START> went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4 unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks br br too cartoonish and very disappointing
<START> if i accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh i would not however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh although i am still not altogether sure where these are i don't care if this is woody allen this writer cannot write dialogue or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns for example br br paraphrase i'm an art historian i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery br br ok so it states the fact but honestly do you know of any art historians who would say that how would you answer br br really an art gallery who would've thought it br br the entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer i admit that i have no knowledge of allen's other work and judging by this one i don't want to start learning the characters are loathsome without exception an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition or really really poor character writing you be the judge
<START> the back of the dvd box says ellen page co stars in this movie she does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role i don't consider it a supporting role either but rather a bit part also the plot has many unexplained elements some examples are why does the main character reject her oldest son why does her youngest son drive head on into the train he says its for a sucker bet which doesn't explain anything obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet this film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen
