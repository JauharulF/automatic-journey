<START> i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasn't a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen i can't wait to see where she ends up she's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd
<START> i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and i'm stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it the story was so ravaged by plot holes and the majority of the acting so flat categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie br br justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's warnings that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments with the help of a couple pals he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin uncovers an unexpected secret br br one positive point is that felissa rose is hot i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit but no such luck it would have been the film's potential saving grace eric conley played justin very adeptly i thought and i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future br br the general premise of the film although plagued by clichÃ©s might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david h rigg justin's father the horror pardon the pun br br i have nothing against low budget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come i'll cut low budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i don't give allowances however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script there are a vast number of competently made low budget films out there sadly this isn't one of them i can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production
<START> it's very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece this opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that epoch 1100 b c they personalize perfectly the characters a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect in mediterranean regions where the action of the poem occurred and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
<START> the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being if you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film
<START> indian summer is a good film it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional how about sam raimi playing the camp buffoon i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton like performance solid directing and nice cinematography
<START> i watched this immediately after seeing hillside cannibals so anything would have been an improvement on top of that it stops me from comparing zombi 3 to 28 days later and its sequel unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised how well made danny boyle's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 weeks later br br one can't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of italian horror movie i was totally convinced zombi 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest in which case i would have called my summary 28 years later geddit but wasn't until i came to this page to find it was released in 1988 all the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now br br much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity for example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a dj likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they've had their head chopped off wait till you see the fridge scene you might just die laughing even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career br br obviously you're reminded of the earlier film the crazies which also reminded me of the later 28 films bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you'll have worked out that basically everyone dies the problem with this is you'll instantly be reminded of how the british franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie zombi 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
<START> sometimes realism can work against the effectiveness of a film that's no problem here the sets are cheesy inside and out the fog is ubiquitous half disguising the shabbiness of the production if there's a bar the name painted on the front window says simply wine and spirits the result is a claustrophobic set of scenes not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline that's the kind of dublin this story is about just as jack the ripper movies are about seedy foggy cobblestoned whitechapel who would want it any other way how could it have been any other way with no bankable stars a minuscule budget and a four week shooting schedule the acting follows suit outrageously hammy on everyone's part sometimes my god it's positively excruciating mrs mcphillips moaning after frankie is shot dead outside the house victor mclaglin however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance wardrobe has stuffed him into a too small jacket so that he seems to be bursting out of it like frankenstein's monster his every movement seems to go a little farther than it was intended to when he slaps his cap on his head he bops himself on the temple a big blustering blubbering baby he seems constantly drunk he betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his would be girl to america not a good guy in the ordinary sense yet we wince as he begins to spend the 20 pounds more and more of it during a wild alcoholic night because every expensive and grandiose gesture takes him farther from his dream i wouldn't argue it but i can understand why he won an oscar br br as for max steiner's score wow every movement already overdone is not only underlined by the mickey mouse music but highlighted in glossy yellow it shouldn't have happened the heavenly choirs the endearing young charms the minstrel boy the gurgling tune while mclaglen drinks from the bottle it would have been better off with no score at all br br well how is it as a whole dated by any measure but not a product of its times that's why i admire it yes the symbolism is clumsy at times mclaglen a real dummy bumping his head against a hanging sign the fog the blind man but what impresses me is how little of this was being tried at the time what strikes us as overly arty today was in 1936 something quite different from what was seen in most of the programmers being ground out at the time if it falls short at times it doesn't matter the movie was an act of courage politically and morally as well as poetically the legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a brothel a director's goal should exceed his grasp or what's a script for watching it now however in 2006 the story is more disturbing than ever john ford obviously sympathized with the irish rebels they kill but only out of what they see as necessity he knows too much to live what if he goes to the tans oh it's not me self i'm thinking of but all of us of ireland herself the irish are sentimentalized and sympathetic i wonder if the jihadists in the middle east don't use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence
<START> i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the separation of church state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke br br there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens br br i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by reefer madness that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach christian principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world br br it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century
<START> it was just a terrible movie no one should waste their time go see something else this movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you want to see a good movie don't see made men
<START> scary movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words it makes movies like malibu's most wanted look like oscar material lets just say that br br the original scary movie was great fun one of the better 90s spoof movies coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with dont be a menace to south central whilst drinking your juice in the hood but what the hell happened after the tragedy that was scary movie 2 i thought the cast and crew change would help matters but its even worse br br within 20mins i'd smiled twice not one laugh the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor the fact that at this point in writing the majority of people on this site have voted it 10 10 has made me feel physically ill when there's great flicks like school of rock out which actually have jokes that are gasp funny anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined br br no stars
<START> an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very realistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the 70's and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the r b charts at the time
<START> i adored this movie not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu although he is in practically all german movies that count but also because he is not the main actor the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat who was the only reason to watch 2001's julietta and who really carries this movie on his shoulders br br a family moves from italy to germany seeking the german dream this is my own invention and ironic of cheap labor in steel and coal industries however they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming from this point onward the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family giancarlo bleibtreu and gigi metschurat gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to italy what follows is a great and totally neutral look at what life can become formed by the choices you make br br in the end this movie doesn't say which life gigi's or giancarlo's was more successful or fuller or more interesting it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration the fact that director fatih akin's moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially metschurat and this i really need to stress the little boy who plays young gigi that kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it
<START> though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio's 14th century decameron story collection br br set within a medieval italian town's largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in time br br given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church's rules br br nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
<START> after going for a bike ride that day lying beside a lake in a nature reserve spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it this film made absolute sense to me br br the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done br br reminded me of baraka 1992 but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph br br this comment requires a minimum of ten lines ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
<START> a clever undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a us conglomerate in london he's abetted by foxy and deceptively sharp maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob newhart this is a heist film with a lot of brains ustinov is exceptional as is smith and newhart is quite funny the real surprise is karl malden as the pill popping executive vice president malden has seldom been so loose cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameos the excellent music score is by laurie johnson eric till's direction is brisk and the script by ustinov and ira wallach is first rate very smart a swinging good time
<START> a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is lively action and spectacular stunts for their day give this movie some real zip and there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads quinn makes a good villain also although his role is completely overshadowed br br but don't be fooled by maureen o'hara's tough broad role this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made but it's still hard to get past for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off screen situations this is still little more than an adolescent good time
<START> a meteorite falls in the country of a small town bringing a jelly creature an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand and the youths steve andrews steve mcqueen and his girlfriend jane martin aneta corsaut take him to dr t hallen steven chase the local doctor treats carefully the blister and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man when steve returns he sees the blob killing the doctor steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers but nobody believe on them while the blob engulfs many people getting bigger and bigger br br the blob is a cult and classic sci fi it is a low budget movie with many ham actors and actresses with the exception of steve mcqueen awful effects but also delightful and very but very funny this is the first time that i see this classic i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci fi b movies from the 50s the film subject of my review number 1 400 could not be better my vote is seven br br title brazil a bolha the blob
<START> the best thing about this movie was uh well i can't think of anything this was bad the script was especially bad the technical concepts were bad the suspenseful plot was bad the dialog was bad avoid at all costs do not rent do not watch you'll be sorry
<START> this was a complete disappointment the acting isn't bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is o k if you are o k with cheesy moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it
<START> first before reading further you must understand that i'm not neo nazi i'm just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again br br i've seen this series and found it awful i mean ok it's interesting to look but is it real i searched for answers and found one absolutely not first hitler wasn't angry all his life the series shows an angry hitler even when he is a child second hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly probable that hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret third people will hate me but it's true hitler was charming how do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly because he was charming that's a common point i found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him of course not jews br br this series was awful because if you think that hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all you're wrong if you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him of course remember he was elected and stop theme before it's too late br br life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did
