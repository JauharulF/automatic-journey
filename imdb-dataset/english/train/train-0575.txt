<START> what's with indonesian musical movies never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines br br this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks it's a simple story plot but it's quite focused though with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there br br confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected the main actress may try to live up the character but it's the best that she could do trying as for the casting i don't feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course that's not the only unnecessary characters br br the strange thing is why would i want to watch this movie maybe because of the mangoes
<START> mary pickford becomes the chieftain of a scottish clan after the death of her father and then has a romance as fellow commenter snow leopard said the film is rather episodic to begin some of it is amusing such as pickford whipping her clansmen to church while some of it is just there all in all the story is weak especially the recycled contrived romance plot line and its climax the transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery but even accounting for that this doesn't appear to be director maurice tourneur's best work pickford and tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl ' typecasting pickford as a child character
<START> this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
<START> artimisia was on late last night at first i didn't think i would like it but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia a virgin pure and passionate her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's great play great camerashots great music and texts i loved it and i want more of it
<START> after spotting the high rating on imdb i decided to go see this movie beyond that high rating i intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews i wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations br br given my rating you can see that i was disappointed i enjoyed the development of the main character mike enslin i also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room by the time enslin entered the room i was ready for some scary stuff br br first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded enslin reacts in a believable manner he's freaked out i'm encouraged and think to myself this is going to be good the people who made this movie understand that less is more br br but it's what happens next that was a big let down the subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach just blast the audience with every hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works let's see a clock radio that turns on by itself good that's always scary objects that move around in the room good you can't complain about that blood dripping from the walls and sink great ghosts that commit suicide good anything else how about loud noises shaking fire more shaking messing up the room more blood etc etc it's all good and it's all been done before overstimulate our attention deficit disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession and they won't be able to look away br br well it didn't work for me and you know what else when i go see a horror movie in a theater it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments but this movie had no scary moments the audience was silent and disinterested i felt no chill down my spine nothing the shining was 100x what this movie tries to be br br so who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever friends of the director sorry i just don't get it
<START> the little girl desi is so adorable i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here it will make you cry laugh and believe knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there great cast and an overall great movie
<START> i'm not going to comb over tlps's obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws instead i shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film br br 1 peter bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety this fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography br br 2 bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be by sharing cybill shepherd's his then gal fabulous body and breasts with his male audience and not just on one but on two occasions brava the unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta br br 3 tlps has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in america's deep south as if it weren't bleedin' obvious so he hammered that point on and on and on how is this an advantage you might ask well when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear drums you start experiencing a strange exhilaration the movie's finally over it's pure joy br br 4 the movie gives all women who look like cloris leachman hope hope that they too may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good looking boyfriend br br 5 cloris leachman's biography which i realize isn't technically a part of tlps gives hope to all women that look like that that they too may one day win a miss chicago beauty pageant provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with br br you think i'm joking abut cloris having won a beauty pageant huh well check out her bio and then we'll see who laughs last br br 6 the movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of cloris leachman's face in its original natural non glory
<START> really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlito's ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higher br br its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90's overall it was approximately Â£6 and 2 hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltio's way fans avoid this fiasco
<START> otto preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip side of laura while that film was glitzy and features the high fa luting clifton webb this film is a whole lot seamier dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked andrews is quite fine a lot less wooden than he's been in the past and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion piece to preminger's equally lurid whirlpool also starring tierney
<START> for paris is a moveable feast ernest hemingway br br it is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings novels songs poems short but unforgettable quotes and yes movies the celebrated film director max ophÃ¼ls said about paris br br it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass coffee and lukewarm brioche gigolos and prostitutes at night everyone in the world has two fatherlands his own and paris br br paris is always associated with love and romance and paris je t'aime which is subtitled petite romances is a collection of short films often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world in each we become familiar with one of the city of light 20 arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages genders colors and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages in some of the petite romances we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest closeness and perhaps relationship like for podalydÃ¨s and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leÃ¯la bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose cross cultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant in le marais one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness asking permission to call never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand french br br some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark in walter salles and daniela thomas' loin du 16Ã¨me catalina sandino mareno amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace is single working class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is place des fÃªtes by oliver schmitz aÃ¯ssa maÃ¯ga and seydou boro co star as two young people for who love could have happened there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere and the city of love and light is no exception another one that really got to me was bastille written and directed by isabel coixet starring sergio castellitto miranda richardson and leonor watling castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives br br i can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems i like some of them very much the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again they are place des fÃªtes that i've mentioned already pÃ¨re lachaise directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever oscar wilde alexander payne the director of sideways who would save one troubled relationship payne also directed 14th arrondissement in which a lonely middle aged post worker from denver co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious tuileries by joel and ethan coen with who else steve buschemi is my absolute favorite in both shorts american tourists sit on the benches margo in the park and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers observing the life around them with the different results while margo may say my feeling's sad and light my sorrow is bright steve's character will find out that sometimes even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country
<START> a brilliant movie about family guilt sacrifice betrayal and love macy is such a great actor it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesn't have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for but he's such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work i highly applaud the casting of tracey ullman as the neglected wife who knew sutherland is also very good the way he moves makes his character look taller and even younger in some scenes almost everyone knew what they were doing br br macy's portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery
<START> i had heard some bad things about cabin fever almost as much as i heard the cultish hype as it turns out the first film from the new impresario eli roth it's just a so so effort with the iq points dropping as the film progresses there are worse movies out there and surely more gory ones while i'm not sure how the hype meter got so high on the blood count for hostel there is a good amount for genre fans here the premise isn't necessarily bad either though kids go to a cabin for a week of partying only to come across a very sick man covered in blood whom in a panic they set on fire he winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh eating virus one way or another the characters either the lead college kids including rider strong as the hero and james dibello as the goofy side bar or the supporting 'village' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia if not painfully so br br as they meet their fates the townspeople get pretty weird and it just seems to be non sensibly thrown together without the many laughs 'pancakes kid' comes out of nowhere and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself but in the context of the rest of the movie it just doesn't work there's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others and the family that goes after dibello following an incident has some possibilities that aren't realized but all the while roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around which isn't all for not either now unlike lesser troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s to which i'm sure roth is a die hard fan he doesn't make it unwatchable it's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from br br but unlike those films too he also doesn't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy horror times his film tries for that of course and only once or twice does he make it a goofy bloody time i did like the random bunny strong sees while on the gurney it's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time albeit with its own contrived style choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling alley worker it simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made shave your legs with a deadly virus uh huh and it aims for fairly typical ground if that's your cup of tea more power to you but at the end i found it to be actually un exceptional genre territory that doesn't offend audience sensibilities ala saw but doesn't swing for the fence either as a clever b movie roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of 'what the hell' as the santa claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people it could work if he followed up on it with something better or if he dropped it altogether same could be said for a lot of the movie c
<START> this film is harmless escapist fun something the recent tomb raider film lacked i can't wait to get the dvd how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know anything with karen kopins in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find that how to lose friends and alienate people was nowhere near as 'gross out' a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect i rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout pacing of the more visual humorous content was i thought spot on i mean i got the impression i was witnessing pegg's attempts at restoring lost control very much 'in real time' so to speak at other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists' i e pegg's and dunst's reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves all the characters were well cast to some extent interesting in and of themselves and generally quite likable any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience an entertaining intelligently scripted brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that i would thoroughly recommend
<START> gender bender the limerick br br a man or a woman who knows br br it turns out that 'it' is both br br sleeping in clay br br then they all went away br br in one of their ufos br br gender bender is another great season 1 episode i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what's gonna happen next it is entirely original the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does i really like the atmosphere at the kindred's little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night its very exciting this is one of my favorite season 1 episodes in fact i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles many people see this as a non mythology related alien episode kind of like the unnatural or space but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone huh anyway i give the episode a 9 out of 10
<START> yeah well i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life here's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets ' we have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up and coming son jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction he claims otherwise that it's love but after watching this it's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard alright he's not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin it was never shown just told that jaemin loves sumin perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head crazy stalking mad love over in seoul it has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy i was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance okay so sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves but after his first taste of his stalker's attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring what ok well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn't stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies
<START> colman's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script the gargantuan hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the german expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into hollywood films very good use of shadows and light and silhouette i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film and he starts reciting othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil already the viewer sees the text and the drama of shakespeare getting a hold of tony and off he goes on his journey of doom i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear her pleadings tony stop you're hurting me are chilling and suspenseful you just don't know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2 3rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film masterful work from george cukor he's such as skillful director excellent film too bad they don't make 'em like they used to
<START> contrary to another reviewer i think that this is well written especially the more fictional it is because greater imagination would be required and well acted because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen minutes plus well done monologues but i'm just not entertained by such solemn pious rememberances everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others everybody has problems and some are more intense than others these are just ten not very atypical stories and problems exemplifying how anybody's life or part of it is fodder for film then again i think poorly of tv's reality shows too so if that's your bag you may like this it's the kind of stuff that would make for good 'phone and or internet gossip but absolutely without other than verbal action and although each of the speakers is female i'm gonna leave gender outta this
<START> ah moonwalker i'm a huge michael jackson fan i grew up with his music thriller was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him sorry michael but moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of michael's success of the time right when he released his famous bad album that was record breaking was the first album to have 6 top ten singles michael is an incredible artist there is no doubt he writes sings dances but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audienceÂ not so much br br we start off pretty simple jackson's music life career success and the mania that was the 80's biggest star in the world michael jackson later on jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children when jackson was allowed to be near children we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog the dog runs away and in their search for it jackson and the children uncover the lair of mr big frankie lideo a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs starting with the children mr big discovers jackson and the children but they escape jackson tells the children to meet him at club 30's which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s the story goes back to the mobsters attack on jackson and here it is revealed that jackson is actually a magical gangster who draws his power from shooting stars as one passes by the club jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of mr big's henchmen the story picks up on the children at club 30's and at first the children are afraid but when jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s the club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers jackson participates in a dance off with the other club members which serves as the music video for smooth criminal at the climax of the song mr big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children katie jackson follows them back to big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen mr big appears and mentally tortures jackson by threatening to inject katie with highly addictive narcotics while katie manages to just grab joe pesci's glasses and get free from being injected mr big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off jackson but not before a shooting star flies by jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of mr big's soldiers yup ummm you want more weirdness watch the movie br br moonwalker is fun for the first half hour seeing michael's success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again is it mostly to hype up his album yeah i love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is then we go to his song called leave me alone which is kind of hypocritical not that it's not a great song just a small turn of events then when we skip the crummy acting the story was incredibly weak the villain spells his name out loud while michael and katie are spying on him lol michael is a transformer all of a sudden the villain's big monster plan is to make kids high also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make marvin the martian blush but if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for smooth criminal this music video is perfection it's choreographing it's setting it's song it's smooth style michael always goes above and beyond perfection and smooth criminal was incredible i loved moonwalker as a kid i still watch it for fun to this day but it's not the best movie by any means it's pretty silly but it's all good if you're a michael jackson fan as well br br 7 10
<START> this contains spoilers br br i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is and being french it tries for depth by being enigmaticÂ nothing really makes any sense br br lÃ©o is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is hiv positive the youngest brother marcel has not yet come down to breakfast and the first thing the family does is decide that at 12 years of age he is too young to be told maybe if he was four or five but twelve the first totally unbelievable thing is that the family doesn't even ask where or how he got the virus how long he has known about itÂ nothing is asked they only worry about marcel finding out this is a very close Âknit provincial family but although they decide not to let marcel know about lÃ©o's hiv positive status nor the fact of his being gay the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions how many families do you know where the parents brothers wouldn't have at least some reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay here nothing br br lÃ©o decides that he needs to go to paris to see his ex lover and he decides to go on the trip with of all people marcel do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover again totally unbelievable especially since marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality if this is the way the family has decided to let him find out it is rather brutal and again unbelievable br br lÃ©o goes to find his lover aymeric at his work in a paris bar the owner says that aymeric will not be there until the early evening but why would lÃ©o want to see him at work why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk why not go and see him at his home but no lÃ©o shows up later in the day with marcel in tow and is surprised when aymeric doesn't just drop everything to go walk with him for 5 minutes aymeric tells him that he is no longer available that it was lÃ©o who left him and that lÃ©o hadn't replied to any of his letters lÃ©o says but i love you and then wanders off but if he really loved aymeric wouldn't he have at least told him about his hiv status to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication this would be the least he could do Â but not a peep he leaves and doesn't even warn aymeric that he might have contracted the aids virus this is totally irresponsible of him Â and of the film makers this film was apparently made for a french tv series for young people Â it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible well not hereÂ i guess every man for himself is still the french way of doing thingsÂ another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the touchy feely aspect everyone is always leaning against someone caressing someone or kissing someone inside the family and outside the family i have never seen anyone in france be this physical never mind an entire family seated at the breakfast table one 17 year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something how many brothers do you know who are that physically close in another scene the same 17 year old comes into marcel's room asking what's the matter can't you sleep then takes off his clothes and completely naked gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers this and another similar scene between lÃ©o and marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film sorry again i don't believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers br br the only good thing i can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fineÂ especially marcel in the main role but it wasn't really enoughÂ hiv and aids are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light at the end of the film the family has gone to the cemetery to bury lÃ©o but once again marcel has been left out of it Â he has been left in the care of a cousin i think nevertheless he sneaks out and watches the funeral from afar is this what such a close knit family would have done it is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brother's funeral it was the last scene of the film and it was the last straw for this viewer
