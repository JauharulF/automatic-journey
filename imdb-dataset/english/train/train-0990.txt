<START> as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again the swimming pond it's called a tank in central texas the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end through the pain we go through in life life goes on and there can be forgiveness
<START> i basically found eden's curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch however there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing the back to the earth philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on as was the don't ask don't tell pseudo liberalism of the fraternity made up of east coast intellectuals except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia where i imagine the good ole boy mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images i felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene
<START> i know a few things that are worst a few it had a couple of funny scenes it is a movie not appropriate for kids but only a child would find this movie hilarious this is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for don't waste your money just to laugh a couple of times
<START> if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it so bad it wasn't intended to be that way but superb anyway go find it somewhere whatever you do do not miss it

<START> this is a great film the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now i may not have seen the play but even if i had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good
<START> the basic formula for the original series was take someone get the audience to like them then put them into mortal danger this formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964 68 br br now we jump forward 40 years to 2004 we are introduced to alan tracy a somewhat less than diligent college school kid with his friend fermat a young know it all they are whisked off by lady penelope in her pink ford thunderbird to the island paradise where the tracy family live for the school holidays almost immediately they are left in the care of kyrano and his daughter tin tin whilst the adults go to rescue john from thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident this is all part of the hood's scheme to take over tracy island so that he can steal the thunderbird machines br br Âto rob a bank br br yes the plot is as limp as that br br the dialogue is banal the acting more wooden than that of the fibreglass puppets the effects anything but special and hans zimmer's scoreÂ what little there was of barry gray's glorious theme shone through zimmer's lackluster orchestration the rest of the score was eminently forgettable in fact part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn't recognise it i didn't even bother to stay to witness busted's mediocre efforts with the end titles br br to be fair ron cook worked quite well as parker he and sophia myles as penelope seemed wasted with the right material they could have been show stoppers the cgi work was what i would have called leading edge 5 years ago br br the dynamics of the main craft were just wrong the original series models at least moved as if they had mass br br another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements from every vehicle being built by ford to the entire content of the tracy freezer being produced by ben jerry's br br my son 9 enjoyed the film but this cross between spy kids and 'clockstoppers' aimed squarely at his age group added nothing to the thunderbirds legend when star trek hit the big screen in 1979 with 'the motion picture' a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so with this film frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the thunderbirds franchise br br i predict that this film like 'the avengers' and 'the saint' before it will sink into obscurity within 6 months leaving the original series to its 'classic' status
<START> this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny when i saw this film i saw it for john candy and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments and to top it off candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time so despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs it's really a shame it could have been so much better i mean with eugene levy joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful
<START> as a baseball die hard this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie authentic looking sports action believable characters and an original story line while angels in the outfield fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two angels weaves the story of roger and j p two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the woebegone angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games pushed by his deadbeat father's promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise's downward spiral and when short fused manager george knox portrayed by danny glover begins believing in what roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around and roger and j p find something to believe in glover in particular gives a nice performance and tony danza playing a washed up pitcher also does well despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup
<START> by all accounts this could have been an interesting film featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as the future of british horror i expected alex chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype br br i was wrong br br everything about this film is either cliche or inept the short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties admittedly the idea of 'the sick room' did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting br br chandon cannot write dialogue every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence the typical 'cop on the edge' formula funny i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before no chandon you are not tarantino or scorsese it sounds bad add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting don't get me wrong dani filth is a great singer and musician but actor he ain't and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing give me bruce campbell any day br br the visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious cgi awful gore effects for goodness sakes peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing filters that shriek over use as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth's score man they should sue br br the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects eg maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc rendering cradle of fear in my mind second rate and obsolete br br i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares br br better luck next time
<START> most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen br br if i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film it didn't make you care about the characters like them or dislike them it turns the characters into jokes br br awful br br ridiculous br br waste of two hours of my life
<START> this is a thinking man's silly movie if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way br br it's not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
<START> this is an excellent movie the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent the movie is basically about a well accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home once the bodies are at his home he removes stuff i hate to use such a general term but i forget what it was he removed and puts it into his wife to retain her youth then a reporter patricia hunter investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place definitely watch this oldie but goodie if you can
<START> in 2151 in broken bow oklahoma a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor however captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr phlox who is treating klaang to complete his crew and the vulcan sub commander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise when the equipment of the starship is shut down klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting captain archer is informed by dr phlox that the alien was actually a mutant altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronos br br in spite of being a huge fan of star trek i have not followed the episodes of enterprise on cable television i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me the adventure of the first enterprise captain jonathan archer the gorgeous t'pol reed mayweather dr phlox hoshi and trip is excellent at least in this pilot i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts but on dvd they are just one therefore my review is valid for both i did not like the music score theme which i found very annoying but this was an exception in this great show my vote is nine br br title brazil broken bow
<START> well this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated i thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made for disney channel type mode especially a go kart racing scene that was incredibly long alana de la garza is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner the laughs are very few and far between the end surprise for mr fix it is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie
<START> sadly marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page's life to go along with her own issues with men as typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted to add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to bettie page herself bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a born again later in life through the influence of her 3rd husband a minister she left it because she was in her late 30's her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick fetishists harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager who did many famous photo shoots of bettie also did many naughty shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film br br the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it
<START> may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again don't get me wrong i still don't like the movie i still think it's dreck and i still think the zombies don't look all that zombie ish the story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame the story is about a guy named rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in animals and his brother germaine the two aren't exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot one day germaine is shot in a drive by shooting and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germaine whereas most people would've called 911 but whatever naturally the serum fails and germaine dies if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie after the police and the coroner until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics should've shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which i still believe was just someone's van with a coroner decal thrown on the side and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics i would talk more about the plot but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it and we wouldn't want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended as i've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies i still think they look like they've been in a bar fight that's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims also i still don't like the fact that the director s continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move they couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do don't get me wrong i'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people in one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just shambles to them and sometimes they just don't seem believable yes i know their fictitious creatures but still i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and i still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then jerks like he was just shot the sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non existent music in a movie is important folks especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick the acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the american actors from the japanese zombie movie junk the movie is still bad almost house of the dead bad it's better no doubt about that but then again that's not saying much it's not the worst movie out there and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn't good i also think the movie moves really really slow despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes i still don't like the opening song this is the type of movie i think is well suited to be premiered on the sci fi network which is why i am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten but think of it this way at least it's not a negative one
<START> i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been and discovered considerable artistic merit which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing br br first of all this movie attempts serious science fiction social commentary more than action adventure there is action in it but that's not really what it's about if you focus on that you'll end up with as others have noted a bad aliens clone but again that's not what it's about br br the movie is really about todd's kurt russell transformation from human to near machine and back to human mostly back but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions and he really does a wonderful job it can take two viewings to appreciate it br br the surrounding social logic is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human ness or what but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's easy to underestimate talent
<START> devil's experiment 1 10 hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot gee that is one lucky pizza boy and those without anal amateurs 36 devil's experiment falls solidly into the latter category br br it is of course the horror version of hardcore porn an almost completely plot less 43 minute wait for the money shot shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non descript japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive japanese girl the tortures range from the banal slapping her 50 times kicking her a hundred the silly tying her to an office chair and spinning her around the fear factor a bath of maggots and sheep guts and finally the money shot a well executed eyeball piercing br br that's it no plot no motive just blair witch tree shots and torture the girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the spanish inquisition during the office chair scene i was bored silly staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the money shot just like hardcore porn
<START> not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game after having played the demo however i was sold undying really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in you have this green amulet called the gel'ziabar stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper look with the stone glowing at for example a painting and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't expect them and can kill you very quickly there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead to experience something like this is a real accomplishment there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros that is all fine in the beginning but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating and there is no map the game demands you memorize your surroundings so patience is required also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can't progress i don't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures but in first person mode that can be an annoying task luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace and trust me you will need it overall undying is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
