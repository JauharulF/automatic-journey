<START> this movie is really bad the acting is plain awful except michael ironside i don't get the story richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc gangs he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian land at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home town i didn't hear that in the movie if so it wasn't clear br br richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor stiff and ugly he said his lines like it too and we wouldn't talk about sean young she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt grieco she is awful br br when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast maybe i should have taken subterfuge br br don't see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses br br i will soon uptade the cast list because i have it at home i wrote it down after i seen the movie
<START> i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i can not find it anywhere please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating swayze did a great job i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work
<START> i couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short not bad commentary this movie is much better than just not bad the acting is stellar even from the children in the cast who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends the movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well the double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later if you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness then check out holes my 6 year old enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them how many movies can you say that about
<START> dangerous offender is the story of a seemingly anti social girl and how she got that way it's based on a true story and though i was irritated by the one note depiction i e ever scowling of the title character and the hard to believe dedication of her lawyer i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art and that there are people out there like that br br the movie succeeds for me because although there's little softening of the title character's demeanour until almost the end one is gradually moved to sympathy for her as the movie shows how she got to her present state which proves to be self destructive rather than anti social br br truly a moving movie which will bring a lump to your throat when you think on it which will be often br br despite its many flaws including that it's hard to watch sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide attempts this is another production that i'm proud to call canadian
<START> very disappointing film by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part and william macy was good as always still not worth watching it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep
<START> this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9 and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although i'd like to see it once more before i do he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the pre eminent film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this br br about europa itself i'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think that's the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydow's narration we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is our his subconscious mind i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von trier's other films in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she didn't really say that did she br br so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in our von trier's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself symbolize consider it internally and only then discuss it externally europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
<START> this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw i was about 5 at the time it scared me good but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster and my mom got very upset she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint now that's a movie hey for it's time it was a great movie that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then and if your 5 it is very scary kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects imo
<START> i happened to catch this film at a screening in brooklyn it's difficult to describe the plot it has a lot of wacky characters but let's just say i'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest i wouldn't know where to begin even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted br br there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable it has a few devices that pop up and add another hilarious layer it is refreshing to watch not some recycled stuff i'd seen many times before if this film could reach a wider audience i'm certain it would be a real crowd pleaser the story is so original and heartfelt br br there's a lot here to like funny back stories mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion cross eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout definitely worth seeing
<START> i liked this movie a lot the animation was well done and the romance was cute i liked most of bryan adams' songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent what a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness apocalypse now themes what happens when so called civilization invades someone elses home what does it mean to be civilized etc the opening scenery and music were very stirring the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful
<START> read on and take note you could save 88 minutes of your life was that all br br unremittingly bleak this film sets out to produce i'm guessing a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style if fails completely and absolutely fails i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't let me mention some of the highlights br br people don't die they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa's factory angels are actually ex cowboys who sit in trees santa can bring people back from the dead if you send him a nice letter br br and the plot i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any even the photography is bleak snow shown at the end of a freeze everywhere looking cold damp and miserable br br as you might guess the film has a happy schmaltzy ending what a relief
<START> the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater it failed miserably br br apparently the story writer just don't hold water something was definitely missing in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment br br the movie just lack any substance the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time such as the meaning of sacrifice nationalism etc it is called the central theme br br the movie fails to answer why would i watch it anyway br br at least some strange legendary flying elephants psychic king or the eccentric king such as the king and i would have been lovely something would have added greatly to the movies' appeal i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie br br once you got the appeal then the story is the next thing we concentrate on in marketing terms we call it must see upon hearing the title of the movie people would say oh i must see it now where's the appeal in kingmaker why not just redo the title and call it how not to be a king and make a black comedy of the old siamese days to the style of dr strangelove that would have been much more interesting narrative like experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny br br most movies today have that must see appeal such as spiderman men x these titles speak for themselves if they don't have familiar characters some other movies such as the island had an appeal itself when the advertising asks do you still believe there is an island br br or for the movie retitled how not to be a king might ask the question so do you still want to be a king br br parhat
<START> erotic cinema of the 1970's was tame compared to the triple x romps of today which is good because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes of course i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods but it's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil's plaything but if you don't care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex then this isn't the movie for you however i did enjoy it and i give it 7 stars
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash it's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally potter's disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing it's absolutely unreal
<START> i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release in a justifiably empty theater believe it or not after decades of watching movies this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time or at least the worst that i would allow myself to watch br br the acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less br br after the first shock of disbelief we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows but after a while even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad
<START> this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious it'll all become clear it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
<START> elmer fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace all is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by the flea is dressed in a farmer's type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name a flea on it he gets out his telescope and spots the dog we see a big shot of the dog's butt and the flea whistles in excitement screaming t bone he then sings there's food around the corner there's food around the corner br br that sets up the storyline of this cute but obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog the mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea br br the drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times this might be the funniest canine i have ever seen in a cartoon the poor pooch under a threat of having to take a bath as to not react when the stupid flea causes him pain it's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes jackhammers and the like on the dog he puts firecrackers in the dog's behind it's brutal
<START> this film can be judged from three viewpoints as history as a profile of amin as a fictional thriller br br it fails as history it mentions in passing the coup that threw out obote the expulsion of the asians and has the entebbe hi jack as background but not in any chronologically consistent time frame br br as a profile of amin it may have been interesting because forest whitaker is incredibly good and if this was a better film he would get an oscar he got it which proves the oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on it ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel which observed amin and the history of uganda from the point of view of the doctor it tells instead the fictitious story of the scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of amin but the story told is the one incident that amin was probably innocent of br br as a fictional thriller there is no plot to hold it together the beginning is taut it takes cinematic liberties with the novel but sets up the story the character of the doctor is well defined but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result br br why the doctor decides to stay in kampala is badly explained seduced by power why he befriends no one is strange the character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of amin close at hand the man called horse bit at the end is risible br br finally in 1971 uganda drove on the left not right the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers and where are the equator tusks br br in short if you've never heard of amin you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate forest whitaker's acting but the last hour will bore you to confusion if you know uganda or have read the book don't see the film it will only depress you and if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy he wasn't
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk where it was called laupta the flying island i absolutely loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it i was enchanted by the story and characters but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the streamline dub the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set br br unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese had and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead they have made some pointless alterations such as changing the main character's name from pazu to patzu and added some dialogue but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which i find annoying in many disney films br br this film still blows away most recent animated films and i cannot recommend it highly enough the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market homogenized animation
<START> this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d wood a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief while much of wood's work was quirky low budget entries into various genre film traditions his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant garde techniques i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood the experimenter although this film is a comedy a nightmarish comedy however while the cross dressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world and i can't really compare that world with anything else the technical side of the film production design sound design music scoring photography etc is groundbreaking on any number of levels in particular although the film has no dialogue there is sound of all kinds and also language but you'll have to see how it's done yourself as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout the glen or glenda esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum the whole film is played at a hysterical fever pitch and billy zane provides an amazing tour de force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is in a just world he would have been given some award for this performance he even looks like ed wood and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny sleazy tragic sympathetic and anonymous sometimes simultaneously what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release only playing a few festivals right now it's only available on video in germany in fact my copy is from a german source the excerpts from wood's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german although the newspaper headlines that great low budget technique of giving plot elements especially those that would be too expensive to film via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood tradition that zane sees are in english i think that this film could have gotten a word of mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion and if played off city by city slowing on the art film circuit it could have done well in fact if the legal issues can be resolved i'd like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release especially a midnight cult release this is a classic waiting to be discovered br br did i understand every scene no but i felt every scene emotionally did everything work in the film perhaps not i've only seen it twice and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times however with all the assembly line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much alternative film being fetishistic or pretentious shot on video film school rejects we need actual hollywood made experimentation like this the recent bob dylan film masked and anonymous took similar chances as did something like steven soderbergh's full frontal this film could find an audience much larger than either of those if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing see if it has ever been released on video you will not be bored invite some friends over make it a party play the amazing soundtrack loud i have a feeling that wherever he is in the afterlife ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film wood's probably also laughing that just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making
<START> the mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti br br lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations itÃs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and unlike some of itsÃ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre such as the taste of others it actually entertains
