<START> a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the cassette's envelope the owner didn't write it up yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked credits br br some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before br br this film was europa lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with post war german photographs i saw and then the tricky cuts br br the story itself is a hard to take moral odyssey that has no happy end a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post war germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped but he mostly meets distrust and self destructive defiance he hires with zentropa a dining and sleeping car company modeled on mitropa whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash our hero falls in love with his daughter who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi post war terrorists when he doesn't understand the world or just europeans anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved br br as a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied occupied aachen two months before the capitulation the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants with hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart br br however the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident but without exception another cause was found later ignored by some recent pseudo historians for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed out bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin the effect was strongest on the soviets who arrested tens of thousands in large part children 'preemptively' on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died
<START> it was 9 30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought ''holy sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons'' but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it's a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead br br the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv 14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well i've got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four times br br all in all i don't mind father of the pride i don't hate it but i don't like either i've seen way better from ''the simpsons'' br br 3 5 10
<START> now i had the pleasure of first viewing contaminated man when it premiered on tv back in december of 2000 br br an infectious disease expert william hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them now some years later he is now in russia or someplace i'm not sure where exactly all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers one of them a disgruntled security guard named joseph muller played peter weller best known for his role as the indestructible robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back he needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support so he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things it's soon discovered that muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen in fact it's so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds soon word gets out and the disease expert hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an american reporter now muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire russian population br br now as i said before this film is a lot like falling down we have a disturbed person weller here michael douglas in falling down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process next we have a hero type person hurt here robert duvall in falling down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist br br contaminated man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances br br 8 10
<START> a great addition to anyone's collection br br 12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john mcclane br br the virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it br br a man bruce is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind br br the actors in this were awesome i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole bruce meets in a mental hospital br br the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man made virus br br the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities br br this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own br br i very much highly recommend it br br 10 10
<START> i've found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers for american people in general pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts which have none to do with a terrorist attack or criticize american's political behaviour or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11 shame on them
<START> robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members however the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see i think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel noon i had to spell it this way because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to no one character the movie runs a little over 01 30 and within the first 15 minutes or so it seems noon begins his search for pete logande the boy caller br br this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times the conversations aren't too in depth mostly consisting of how are you i'm in the hospital why did you boyfriend move out etc in the book the kid almost becomes noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax br br in the movie noon becomes obsessed with finding logande but the audience is left to wonder why since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller why bother who cares if the caller doesn't exist br br i know there's a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie since it doesn't the movie falls apart br br this is surprising because of maupin's other work tales of the city when it was made into a mini series it worked beautifully
<START> i just purchased and viewed the dvd of this film the dvd transfer is from last year 2001 this 1988 film is really a great little film overlooked by most people i saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since i love the opening shot of pittsburgh not baltimore as another user commented makes pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world and i must say the tour of pitts on the garbage truck with nicky is a very scenic interesting one tom hulce as everyone else has said gives a remarkable wonderful performance the dvd is a good transfer with no extras but a widescreen format i recommend it to those who love the movie
<START> i have seen it it's not good but interesting in an understated way the boys in it are quite naturalistic but the graphic gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and oh yes the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance real atrocity is real this film is just atrocious however the film has a look which can draw you in but it seems to me that is the emperor's new clothes but in fact in reverse the film looks good but the direction story content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous if a feeling can be vacuous this is it
<START> great movie i loved it great editing and use of the soundtrack captures the real feeling of indian life yet we can all relate a well chose cast with some great characters the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural you just can't help but to root for jess in this film the acting was really good even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer
<START> had i watched it in my teenage years this movie was mildly entertaining what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant flips between 'dream' and 'reality br br had there not been movies like 'the 6th sense' and 'don't look now' i would have been surprised by the ending
<START> this movie is jackie's best i still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever i also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a chinese version of john howard unlike some of jackie's other work this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of jackie's fans
<START> this fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre i was happy to see william powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm and without the silly attitude of his nick charles character from the thin man series while the story is good on its own i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael curtiz' fantastically imaginative direction from a visual point of view this is a richly textured movie with curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium from split screen images to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best hollywood directors highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie
<START> her deadly rival 1995 starring harry hamlin annie potts lisa zane tommy hinkley susan diol roma maffia robert c treveiler d l anderson william blair sean bridges robin dallenbach wilbur fitzgerald dale frye stan kelly deborah hobart david lenthall lorri lindberg chuck kinlaw amy parrish melissa suzanne mcbride ralph wilcox al wiggins jeff sumerel daria sanford director james hayman screenplay dan vining br br actor harry hamlin of la law fame clash of the titans and other films seems perfectly cast in this lifetime type film directed by james hayman and released in 1995 he and his wife lisa rinna would later work on a film about sex addiction her deadly rival is at first glance similar to the better known hollywood box office hit fatal attraction in rival happily married couple jim and kris lanford move into a new home in the typically beautiful suburbs they have the seemingly perfect marriage they are deeply in love despite a routine lifestyle but then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on jim her identity is never revealed despite an attempt by jim and even investigators to discover who she is she constantly harasses jim through phone calls and letters his marriage nearly flounders as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up while harry hamlin annie potts and the rest of the cast lisa zane tommy hinkley susan diol roma maffia robert c treveiler d l anderson william blair each seem to be straight out of a soap opera but this is a very suspense filled drama and has its good moments there is a twist at the end spoiler alert all i have to say is her deadly rival was only herself based on a supposedly actual case jim's wife kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage even if the story is not terribly impressive even if the acting is only a step above soap opera acting this film has its moments especially moving are the intimate scenes between jim and his wife and the final scene in which when jim learns the truth he can't believe what he has just heard the movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of tv movie that usually does well especially on lifetime which continues to produce films of this kind of the domestic thriller type or seduction stories trashy but everyone likes trash
<START> when i first saw this movie the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act very anime i think that it's a really good movie to watch the action in this movie is a 10 not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10 if you are gackt and hyde fans you have to see it
<START> moon child starring japanese rockers hyde and gackt was a better movie then i expected in fact i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies br br set in mallepa the story follows a group of street orphans sho sho's brother shinji and toshi who rob and murder to make a living on one of robberies sho encounters hyde's kei vampire burning in the sunlight through the coarse of events kei's true nature is shown yet no one shuns him away br br the time passes and implies that the immortal never changing kei has raised sho and the two have a an extremely close bond sho and kei then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight and they become quick friends both kei and hyde fall in love with son's sister yi che br br time skips ahead again and shows a grown sho this time void of kei it also explains that sho and son have become enemies br br through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it's hardships focusing on friendship and love it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time br br as for the acting i think gackt did a magnificent job hyde did an amazing job for a first timer br br the shots were beautiful but the movie did have it's rare and short gruesome shots br br all in all i must say this movie is amazing moving and i highly recommend it
<START> if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974 this is the movie for you but you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins too see my remarks on my girl 1 for the reference br br indulgent admission i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance having just viewed its predecessor but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother my girl 2 made me look with its theme of searching for mother br br put another way anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2 but relating to a protagonist who asks like so many adoptees who's my mama and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe i'll be sure to make my own movie about it br br people are listless movies should not be listless my girl 2 like my girl 1 is just listless br br avoid unless you're a complete sap who's comforted by a series of small annoyances
<START> i saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in nanaimo bc in the 1970's i was of the tender age of 6 my brother 4 then again when i was 8 my brother 6 this movie terrified my brother and i and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust it wasn't just the movie but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many christians about the mark of the beast and the rapture this movie the church and a volatile neglectful upbringing lead to severe paranoia towards the future for years i lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by christ i am now 40 years old went through years of counseling i once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family i was pegged with a delusional disorder i actually began to believe this it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened i no longer fear the future i have come to terms with the fear injected into it's members by the church i have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose i am nearing my licensure as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma
<START> i admit the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard but now after viewing it the 7th time i admit that it has very much grown on me the characters of sissy ms jellybean and the countess have become very endearing and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet though the plot is very weak i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it then there's the kick ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k d lang who reminds me a little of patsy cline at her best i can't think of any movie that has grown on me after an inauspicious first impression as much as cowgirls has
<START> i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981 i have lost track of how many times i have seen it it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song i think i quote this movie without realizing it i basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it i can't even narrow it down although sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones the famous i'll alert the media when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless but the list is truly endless the scene's at arthur's soon to be fiancÃ©'s father's house are a scream particularly his interactions with the moose do yourself a favour and see this movie
<START> it's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy the jokes were laugh out loud funny and the characters are well acted parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules putting in great performances both on and off the pitch anupam kher is wonderful as jess' worried father and jonathan rhys meyers who was so amazingly evil in 'ride with the devil ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once making full use of his gorgeous irish accent even if you don't like football go see this film if anything it'll make you smile
