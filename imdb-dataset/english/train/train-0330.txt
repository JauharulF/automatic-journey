<START> bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of english fiction into a movie and then slapped silly for this attempt the animation was poor the characters looked ridiculous the music was overwhelmingly blaring and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of tolkien's masterpiece i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways simply because of the medium but this movie regardless of the source of the story is just plain pathetic bashki is capable of much more
<START> i love this anime i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered fiancee is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends clumsily the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water from then on it's pure chaos one after another among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi the sexy shampoo the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero heroine however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time if anyone want an anime that's funny this is the one it's cuter and better with the japanese dub
<START> from the acting direction scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention br br dr suess is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake erection scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed br br compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me unless its the directors family
<START> the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j horror movie this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks br br the story is about perception of the people who works lives and loves of our protagonist and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash backs as the movie runs its course and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems the movie mostly took place in a small out dated radio station's studio with a very bad history where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re locating it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co workers or it was all in his mind what i like about this film is that the film makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did this movie is a very smart abide rather short 76 minutes film
<START> when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese this thing actually made 20 million bucks and mcqueen's salary was 3k all were vastly overpaid the 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen age years and those blasts from the shotgun sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor the ending was pitifully trite obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel and there were many thumbs down
<START> good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history very good acting and script not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust very touching as well for the spiritually mature not for people who do not like to think
<START> i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie benicio del toro shouldn't work in production of movies he should put accent on his acting and that's it steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution about it's ideals and most important about life of che guevara and so on camera is awful like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it music is i don't know is there some music in the movie i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one it's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the tv or whatever i can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars disaster disaster disaster disaster don't watch please save yourself from this misery of movie
<START> spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others br br the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie br br the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot br br i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach br br i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour
<START> philo vance had many affinities with bulldog drummondÂ he was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the british upper classes and he was also independently wealthyÂ br br but there were vital differencesÂ drummond was an adventurer charming gallant livelyÂ vance could be pompous slight1y dull and self righteousÂ there was a hint of fundamental cruelty in his mannerÂ br br the kennel murder case is the most impressive of the 14 vance films made between 1929 and 1947Â the story of a murdered collector of chinoiserie it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery Â exotic setting in the blue nose long island kennel club three killings for vance to solve including a baffling locked room murder the key to the whole affair and plenty of suspectsÂ br br usually a detective story setting have proved too static and talkative to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the printed page but here michael curtiz's direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its typeÂ br br william powell's elegance and suavity made him the perfect vance and although a year later he switched studios he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular the thin man at mgmÂ
<START> 'the shop around the corner 1940 ' is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation by 1940 director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his famed lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark this film was planned for a 1939 release but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming rather than substituting either of his main stars lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing greta garbo in 'ninotchka 1939 ' when it was finally completed 'the shop around the corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role time nevertheless has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence with high profile remakes including 'in the good old summertime 1949 ' and 'you've got mail 1998 ' br br at its surface one might assume 'the shop around the corner' to simply be the story of two lovers klara novak sullavan and alfred kralik stewart who love each other without knowing it however lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that it's the story of matuschek and company a stylish gift shop in budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family when store owner hugo matuschek frank morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work there's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states Â perhaps in the blustery streets of new york Â but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film Â in fact even as i write this review i'm beginning to appreciate the story even more br br sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but i think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped two dimensional portrayal matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy charles smith this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder's later creations for example boom boom jackson in 'the fortune cookie 1966 ' or carlo carlucci in 'avanti 1972 ' of course it doesn't really need saying but billy wilder learned from the best
<START> i mean really how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink ball like demonicus out i mean it should never got the green light to begin with the story is repetitive the characters are weak at best there is no real story on tyranus other then he's a bad dude then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending that's right a bad ending demonicus rises the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in then a picture of chimera comes to life cheaply i might add and chases her out then as she is walking home ala funhouse a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her i mean that makes no sense what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies they could have asked me i had better ideas then demonicus thanksgiving turkey
<START> the photography on the dvd is so dark i thought the screen had died i think i missed seeing half of the movie still it was poorly crafted and not interesting i did not find the story related to the title the black widow i was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames i rented the movie especially for willem dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent i do not believe giada colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture she is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie although they are married in real life they lack chemistry on the screen their relationships did not seem believable i do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot
<START> film version of sandra bernhard's one woman off broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say she's scathingly honest and that may be true but she's also shrill with an unapologetic in your face bravado that isn't well suited to a film in this genre she doesn't want to make nice and she's certainly not out to make friends and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co wrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandra's in house audiences looking completely bored a feeling many real viewers will most likely share 1 2 from
<START> cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story br br the film overall plays out like it's some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere we're never sure of what exactly is going on we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream Â the ambiguity reigns over us all Â hero included and i haven't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry gilliam's brazil going with the eeriness stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there's something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well br br there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually aren't people who say they're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they're not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu's character Â and she's trying to help out the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini cold war something that resembles the u s a and the u s s r in their war of word's heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi littered screen that i was glued to br br what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations Â significant then how the more he acts on his and foster's own motivation this sequence disappears because he's breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that he's being told to live and is branching out br br cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the sci fi genre isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film
<START> i don't remember barnaby jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty lee meriwether asking her father in law barnaby jones buddy ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show br br one thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry goldsmith's excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it br br update 1 11 2009 i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel let's just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show barnaby jones
<START> whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmuller's film is incomprehensible br br this new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i've never walked out of a movie br br but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took lina's movie and turned it into another blue lagoon br br this is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
<START> i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on dvd br br i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old in the netherlands and i was very impressed by it it was shown before walt disney's jungle book br br what i remember of this movie is fragmented i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle this impressed me very much for some reason he was thrown out of his village did not grasp the reason for this when other boys threw stones at him he climbed a rock and jumped off at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace br br cb
<START> as someone who was born to a german mother and english father who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp i come from unique position one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler's state of mind in this the series does quite well carlyle is very good as is o'toole i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career what was going through goebbels goring and hess's mind it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships but i hope it will make people research the subject more it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power
<START> i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it a group of tourists supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn only problem is unless i miscounted there's only one mutant on display and he isn't all that impressive sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago some gory but silly deaths help but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief the ending is predictable and has been done to death no pun intended
<START> this couldn't have been better the strong restraints on mike sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time br br this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner this is a father son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles mike sullivan had no father as a child so john rooney took him in although a generous man mr rooney involved himself in organized crime therefore the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business now sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe but at the same time pay back his boss the events to follow will test sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate br br with a great adaptation by david self the dialogue comes out seldomly but yet very virtuous the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting brilliant art direction by richard l johnson nancy haigh covered with a dark rainy snow on the ground exterior driving the story is thomas newman's wonderful irish score settling in only when necessary br br but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l hall's beautiful photography this is some of the best cinematography i've seen and i watch a lot of films the scene when mike and michael are in the car entering chicago is quite impressive the shot starts at the front of the car revealing mike hanks through the windshield it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car to see michael hoechlin awakening and peering out his side window as it continues it trucks sideways and dollys back completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's chicago br br with a great cast and crew the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film i'm talking about sam mendes who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty won him various awards before american beauty mendes worked as a play director for the british theater but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater with only two films sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors in a list of about twenty five br br the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly the photography acting and story is phenominal i'm still waiting for scorcesee's gangs of new york but for now i'm fully confident in saying that this is the best film of the year considering it's competition signs insomnia minority report thats a strong statement
