<START> we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor we may confess the truth of what we see without being stupid confess that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept br br well obviously many people like such stuff i don't i prefer well thought and planed shows and i also confess that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring those love and drug stories there are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense dallas e g but twin peaks can't catch my attention i don't care about those people except cooper and gordon cole
<START> i don't really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as well br br then there's the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot there's blood involved but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten times there's no blood at all well i guess that's just me br br to make a long story short because believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt
<START> the cast although nothing special all do an ok job the story seems like a good idea the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist so what's wrong with it br br for a start the special effects are really bad if this was made in the 60's it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly 'from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers' br br secondly the direction is weak this film just does not capture the essence of the story a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil or demon type creature should be tense or frightening it simply isn't br br all in all this is a pretty poor film and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining it is still probably best left alone br br a rather sad 4 10
<START> up to this point gentle rain was the movie i found the worst in history it has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster' out of asia it has one star and it is john rhys davies he is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling magical flying baddie he is cast here the rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play no clichÃ©s were missed in the dialogue and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible br br it is fairly easy to see that somebody in asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit my guess is that any career with this movie in it's credential br br do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie a hundred thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey br br the one funny scene was unintentional the brother of the king appears on the scene the king a handsome older short asian actor bad actor the brother a six foot european also a bad actor no excuses were made for this they just expected us not to notice that this poor man's jet li's brother was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap dimestore injun wig right out of an old western movie from the forties
<START> let's face it nancy drew was never great literature it is in the same category as babysitter club magic tree house goosebumps abc mysteries in fact it was one of the original formula stories nancy is perfect pretty thoughtful nice has no internal conflicts ever and never changes ned is pretty much the same the movie was true to that style and i have to say i liked it it will never be a great movie but it had a that same nostalgic flavor that the books held it had just the right amount of suspense for my children 8 and 10 there was almost no offensive language i liked the push for more conservative dress br br corky was a bit of an annoyance he was a little out of place on a high school campus i never quite got why he was there in the first place
<START> i've seen this film in avant premiere at imagina festival in monaco br br i saw the first trailer four years ago and from this moment i was waiting to see the final result i haven't been disappointed br br it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render clearly inspired by some comic books such as the ones from f miller in this optic it goes one step further than the excellent sin city adaptation from r rodriguez this time almost no grey or any middle color but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film can't wait for scanner darkly br br the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements such as direction or plot the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium and that is a really good surprise br br the futuristic story paris 2053 makes it a classic sci fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end despite a classic base plot an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes genetics absolute power of certain firms gives this movie a great interest br br despite it is an animated film this one is obviously not made for children you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral only the cold reality it is far closer to a good film noir br br i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film we still feel the well known paris but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism br br nevertheless i regret a few mistakes the montage is sometimes a bit flat one or two very clichÃ© slow motion effects and some poor dialogs even though the technical is excellent it shows its limits in some romantic sequences a bit like final fantasy did those little things makes it a 7 10 br br altogether it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can the director christian volckman knows how not to fall into potential traps luckyly they didn't ask john woo to do the job br br to conclude it is a film with blasting visuals an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction watch it if you can br br please excuse me for the spelling mistakes
<START> but this movie was a bore the history part was fine but the musical part was not not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard br br if sweet jesus was suppose to be comic relief it never work if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene br br hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie br br the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical br br shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical except for a few chirps nothing else was worth the breath
<START> here's a real weirdo for you it starts out with another take off on the psycho shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean one of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open then it's lets rip off macon county line time as dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one tony march is on target as the evil shotgun happy dean the movie's overall tone is truly disturbing the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it's also a study in despair shallow grave is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over
<START> parker and stone transplant their pacy expletive ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results much of the film is trey and matt running amok with their new toy box the plot is simplicity itself two average guys invent a new sport a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights it runs like a stretched south park episode with the usual machine gun dialogue toilet humour and homilies from the heart br br if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us airplane and the naked gun series this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two dimensional yasmine bleeth in the role usually given to priscilla presley robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b tard that has been his party piece ever since bullitt and ernest borgnine overacts as only he can but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner br br for those who haven't noticed yet parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics this manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create as usual they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra non pc vehicle dvda br br a special mention must go to dian bachar who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and stone's rampaging pair of cartmans br br in summary this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the naked gun airplane formula parker and stone could do something truly brilliant or absolutely awful if given full control over a future film america either lock these guys up or put them in charge
<START> i really do not know what people have against this film but it's definitely one of my favourites it's not preachy it's not anchored by it's moral it shouldn't be controversial it's just god any possible god no matter the religion and it's really funny br br jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed he's quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until he's guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous ground br br ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly well br br as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carrey's pitch perfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it's a wonderful life wannabe br br jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you don't think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couple br br the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey's career which wasn't goin' anywhere
<START> there is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror freddie vs jason the scream movies cabin trash and especially stephen king's infantile attempts he's recycled every story from the monkey's paw to whatever often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one which still has the nail br br but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end this is the way it should be done the director creates tension and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror val lewton original cat people and robert wise a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher jacques tournier another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film not the gross rubbish raimi did gross isn't scary folks it's just gross and lewis allen the uninvited and of course jack clayton's turn on henry james the innocents and the way the master of suspense hitchcock can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like under capricorn br br ten stars
<START> admittedly i know nothing about baseball i'm not even a fan of the sport but that didn't stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers' latest film fever pitch a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy the film is not really about baseball rather it's really about relationships and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place br br jimmy fallen Â giving his best performance to date Â stars as ben a dorky lightly nerdy schoolteacher ben is a kind of man boy who unfortunately has never really grown up and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team ben has devoted his life to the sox and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia br br one day while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office ben meets the go getting lindsey a wonderful drew barrymore lindsey is a corporate career orientated kind of girl but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing he's initially hesitant to ask her out thinking that she's way out of his class and lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in ben br br their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning Â and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are in fact watching a farrelly brothers movie rather than accept lindsey's rather urgent request to reschedule ben sticks around to play nurse orderly and janitor so ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed br br when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch she begins the long fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards soon they are falling in love with lindsey blithely accepting ben's fanatical devotion to his sport br br having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle ben has organized his life around the season Â he's never missed a game but their relationship which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter hits a snag at the start of the season br br lindsey wants ben to do other things like holiday with her parents and party with her friends but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work can she really accommodate ben's infatuation with sports can a die hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all of course lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion wielding friends lindsey's strictest buddy the skinny rich and blond robin kadee strickland insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30 however plump curly haired sarah marissa jaret winokur and molly ione skye supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben br br ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan while lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman fallon is terrific as ben exhibiting real big screen potential overcoming the not insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic barrymore meanwhile is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs br br fever pitch really works and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory br br much of the movie was filmed at boston's fenway park which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well as the ambiance of the games though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados even so fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect mike leonard september 05
<START> the concept of having laurel hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics from especially stan laurel of course as usual br br the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula it doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending it's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless so it works for the movie br br the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over the top as the nutty professor br br the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed it all helps to make dirty work to be one of the better laurel hardy shorts br br 8 10
<START> my super x girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend she was just simply fabulous luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good a lot better than in the scary movie franchise br br ivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well this film is clearly a 10 10 for it's cast uma thurman it's director it's screenplay and from it's original plot line this film is very highly recommended
<START> the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if you're going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they weren't obvious rhymes they were groan inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again
<START> sigh leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool lordi is a mediocre band at best and a single gimmick will get you only so far br br to all you marketing idiots out there this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when finland tries to export something br br lordi isn't scary lordi is lame lordi is over br br i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic faced idiocy sure they won the eurovision br br no wait they won the eurovision that's it i rest my case
<START> guy richie's third proper film not counting the god awful swept away is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling gangsters and chess fans of richie's previous efforts will probably hate revolver as much as i did with its twists and turns richie stalwart jason statham plays jake a newly released ex con out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named dorothy macha a superbly ott ray liotta but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons one of which is andre 3000 from rap outfit outkast who throw him and us the audience a number of red herrings throughout the film all of which becomes extremely tedious the high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot slow mo shootout set to beethoven's moonlight sonata all in all revolver is a flawed work not truly awful but far from richie's best that would still be lock stock if this film was a school homework assignment it would be graded 'must try harder '
<START> you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off well i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see aprile and i knew about nanni moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps caro diario was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways in aprile however moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched whine going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like something i thought was reserved for losers like me surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice and when he started fawning over his newborn baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism
<START> the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most concrete of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not for everyone this film details hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot hanzo 3 who's got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and there's a lot of needless blood and violence it is hanzo the razor after all
<START> this should be a great film meryl streep and jack nicholson co starring as two newspaper writers mike nichols directing uh uh it's dull dull dull pointless and predictable slow and unfocused br br it's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl boy marries girl boy has affair girl leaves boy' story now theres an original concept after squirming through two hours was it only two it felt like six i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy a romance a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in 1986 i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade it's not that it's such a bad picture it's just that it's such an un good one
