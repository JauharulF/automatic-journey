<START> and that's why hard to rate br br from the adult point of view hmm student point of view i must say i fell nearly asleep here sure there is some laughing scene all the credit takes here eddie but that can't save the disney type of script and whole movie that's why br br 2 out of 10
<START> this movie is the best horror movie bar none i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget there's something about him i cant describe
<START> the brak show is good probably not in the same level than aqua teen hunger or space ghost coast to coast but definitely it have many brilliant moments basically it follows the life of zorak and brak that have normal lives and go to the school living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms the humor and the animation of this show it's very much as aqua teen hunger and in one episode you could see meatwad with bizarre situations and strange characters but it is good it have funny parts some of the songs are great others not very much but i like this show the funniest character is the father of brak that is a human nobody knows why
<START> there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1 jesus was blond br br 2 the last supper was a huge meal br br 3 he liked playing with the children br br 4 his death was for all people and for all time br br the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
<START> once in the life is a very good movie however it's not good for everybody due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic believable way the life in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue on video it's ok there is a little overplay sometimes but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise notably in the time action management the characters even though not simple are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack b marsalis if you're not too prude you should enjoy seeing that movie once twice three times i rated the movie 9 10
<START> i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright something told me to you know watch it first i'm glad i did keira knightley ruined all future films for me with this role in the 2nd pirates movie when it came out i went to see it all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for domino br br domino who who is domino harvey i still don't really know or care i don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film i didn't care about her character and even keira getting partically naked didn't make it worth the movie the direction was definitely lacking the writing was trite and shallow the editing was horrible i don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it there's a place for it good examples of choppy mtv style colorful editing not sure if there's an official name would be fight club just off the top of my head even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts it was used tastefully and wasn't used as a crutch i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and crimson tide tony scott please give me my time back br br i understand there are many people who liked this movie i guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment frankly i hate it
<START> i won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by talia sharon as ya'ara the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the u s
<START> revolt of the zombies 2 outta 5 stars no this is not a long lost ancestor to the classic george a romero zombie flicks this is a low budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time but seems awfully routine these days there is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers and a close up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them the effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 i'm sure it had audiences gasping the story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves the movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail's pace so it seems feature length believe me there really isn't much to recommend it you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star wading through a swamp the ending is interesting so i'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 dvd compilation at wal mart for five bucks hey it's well worth the money
<START> this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner
<START> i would have given it a one instead of a two but i suppose it could have been worse i guess the acting isn't all that bad but the plot lacks anything even remotely close to interesting it is a terrible movie terrible complete waste of time i strongly suggest you do not watch this movie
<START> i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting the whole nine yards easily worth the rental by the way but this wasn't it br br i remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms peet was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my penance br br in the first act we have the three lead studs recounting their conquests in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this br br and while i don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other diners do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deaf br br the second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot failing to ask each other or her about what's really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the studs keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain rot i kept hoping for eric's character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they won't talk to each other and his advice sheeesh br br the third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay that's why brad had that happen and jonathan says this and br br what laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the outtakes during the credits weren't very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie br br rating 3
<START> trying to cash in on the success of deal or no deal and 1 versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment show me the money in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire a contestant is given the beginning of a phrase such as which team lost with three choices a b or c each which completes the phrase the contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices the host william shatner at his obnoxious smarmiest asks the contestant if he wants to lock into the answer and when the contestant says yes he picks a 'dancer' to whom he yells show me the money she opens a scroll that has an amount and if his answer was right he adds that amount to his winnings if he was wrong the amount is subtracted so theoretically it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing shatner money there is also a killer card and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll but he has answered properly nothing happens if he's answered wrong the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question if he gets that one wrong he leaves with nothing br br before going to commercials shatner yells let's dance and shatner the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty at the end of the show shatner asks the ladies for a last dance and they all shake it some more br br i give this show 6 episodes at the very most at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door it could've been worse they could've somehow bribed cuba gooding jr to be the host although i bet he's a better dancer than 'shat ' as they call him these days br br 7 08 guess what i was wrong it lasted for only 5 episodes there is hope for the world
<START> an entertaining and substantive film non stop has drawn deserving comparisons with run lola run the film quickly develops into a chase sequence during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences the chase serves not as as a fast paced climax but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film during the run we see the characters grow and momentarily forget about their dreary lives about the macho roles they've bought into and eventually forgetting about why they started running in the first place much like fighting provided a clarity for the characters in fight club running provides this film's characters with a means to step away from the false values that we all allow society to create for us their running serves as way to truly taste life from an unclouded perspective and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process br br my appreciation and enjoyment only wavered slightly in the ending of the film where instead of learning from their experience the characters seem to revert to acting out those false macho roles i thought they had escaped from through their journey br br still the only true problem with this film is that it wasn't distributed outside japan sooner
<START> as an ex teacher i must confess to cringing through many scenes 'though i continued to watch to the end i wonder why boredom perhaps br br the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish mashed and unfocussed the plot too although there were some good ideas the plight of a relief teacher for example were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3 d development br br not one of mr nolte's finer moments as to young mr macchio does he speak that way in every movie br br plot and acting complaints aside the hair styles alone were a nostalgic if nauseating trip br br
<START> john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film his name usually associated with the western film genre however john ford's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early 1920s 1935's the informer br br times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation and the walls are closing in gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree has a warm heart but a short fuse and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self centered pig walking the streets starving with no where to live the hulking gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life katie madden on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the 20 pounds to pay for it as luck would have it his friend frankie is back in town with a 20 pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of frankie's whereabouts gypo with the new 20 pounds of blood money earned finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the ira invests all their resources to find frankie's informer br br victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film his brutish stupid and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore's character arthur bach from the 1981 film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk margot grahame's performance as katie madden is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head mainly because he is most obviously not irish and j m kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film's only poor point br br often overshadowed by some of ford's better known westerns like the searchers or the man who shot liberty valance the informer is easily one of john ford's best films if not his very best beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 ford and company's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story gypo's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed ford's command of this technique was amazing to watch if the informer was made 10 years later thus making the genre requirements it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film
<START> spoilers i'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews it was awful the script and voice acting alone ruined it gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game you almost pray for their deaths and worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast within br br the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing if you're expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story forget it this game's story has very little to do with vampires you won't even see any till about the very end and even then you won't get to fight them br br the story has radical and pretty much blasphemous views of christianity i'm amazed it got off the drawing board i'm not even christian and i found it offensive mostly the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure the kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby in fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks br br the graphics are pretty bad the characters move about at a snail's pace even on the best of systems they are chunky and outdated and it's hard to go from the fmv of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacred br br the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn too i really don't know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together and it's not fun gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend mosely how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesn't think she's the one for him and he seems really grossed out that they slept together but he's so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost don't even care at that point his dialogue was the worst in the game and he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game by the end of the game grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were br br i found the story to be annoying and boring i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one but no instead the story focused on the author's warped vision of christianity what a shame here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got this br br for me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end we do get a few action style puzzles at the end but it wasn't worth suffering through the entire game to get to them br br i can't really recommend this game i had gotten it back when it came out years ago and i hated the game engine so much that i shelved it for years i only recently dusted it off to see what i'd been missing and now i'm very sorry that i did my favorite characters were ruined i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series and i hope they get it right next time it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
<START> to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside giovanna's marriage don't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in 1943 that's not what this is about on the other hand if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo realism by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places this is one of my favorite visconti films
<START> the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh that was one in many goof ups of the movie anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them
<START> i first caught the movie on its first run on hbo in probably 1981 and being 15 years old i thought the movie was hilarious i remember not seeing the alfred e neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers when mad magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from theÂ  usual gang for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap i just assumed they were poking fun at themselves which i'm sure they were but to seriously find them and ron liebman so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits i was quite surprised surely there are many worse movies to be associated with watching the movie on video now at age 32 with the mad references restored i still get a kick out of it and being a ron liebman fan hot rock where's poppa i think it's his crown jewel of performances say it agaaaain
<START> this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old msg and to see this movie was very disappointing i have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and boring there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song
