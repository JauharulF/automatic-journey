<START> i wouldn't call we're back a dinosaur's story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman rhea perlman jay leno walter cronkite julia child kenneth mars yeardley smith martin short and larry king to paraphrase that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three amigos and the cnn guy br br but i guess that i shouldn't focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it's escapism but the perceptive kind i would actually say that john goodman doing rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing
<START> ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie or any taiwanese movie propably for a reason this one was a really boring one even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels br br having read other peoples thoughts i was looking forward for some violence and gore but there's not much at all some blood puking and other lame stuff if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed they clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent br br pretty much nothing good about this movie a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few ok black magic spells like the eel one the plot was confusing and boring the characters were thin and annoying including the main character the horror aspect didn't work at all the most horrifying thing was an albino girl not that scary really this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen
<START> after the reasonably successful masti which was tad better inder kumar returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan based on the hollywood film see no evil hear no evil br br the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke 1994 where kader and anupam play the blind and deaf br br this movie is a tedious exercise br br the film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like snehal dabi's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock br br the film starts off in a clichÃ©d manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all ott chase scenes and fight scenes br br direction by inder kumar is bad music is okay one song stands out i love you my angel br br vivek is awful in the comic scenes his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest esha and amrita are the heroines boman irani annoys here snehal dabbi is okay
<START> i've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies porn movies have better scenarios and effects i wish i had those 2 hours back br br the only good thing about this movie is the cast even though their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable the rest was just way too bad br br it's the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight br br even worse i saw a translated version of this flick imagine a bad movie with an even worst translation yikes
<START> a truly frightening film feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream aspiring people retrograde to the point of being offensive ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex crazed gays wow who knew the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the effeminate buffoon the bitter lonely queen the fag hag etc and the main characters are milquetoast middle class middlebrow clones of little interest br br as far as the romantic ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned there's not much to say we've seen it all before and done much better
<START> it's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what's so difficult about capturing the robbers just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank from all the cameras' footage angles prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages where is the suspense every body is talking about it was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times at least mr spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting the movie is not worth it pronto
<START> a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story so there is more there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player br br this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting br br i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable all in all most of the film goes down very easily it is also forgotten again very easily though so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that br br 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
<START> samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films while shock corridor and the naked kiss represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and the big red one was an effective portrait of the horrors of war merrill's marauders painted war as necessary hell and pickup on south street is about the dangers of communist spies all of his films make for very entertaining viewing and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b filmmaker fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors pickup on south street is no exception and despite the dated themes the film making style is remarkably ahead of its time its also a very quickly pace tight and occasionally brutal film noir br br the acting across the board is fantastic richard widmark makes for a great anti hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend the show stealer is thlema ritter however in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie the angles fuller employs are great making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later pickup on south street is a great action paced noir thriller shock corridor remains my favorite fuller film but this is a very close second 8 10
<START> it was agonizingly bad movie it will eat your heart out while you watch it i beg you don't watch this movie you will hate you losing 1 5 hours of your lifetime it's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy this movie is boring as there is nothing as boring as this movie you will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end and you will hate yourself that you didn't listen to me br br i hate myself i tortured myself and i did watch this movie to the end now excuse me i will shot myself i have seen all br br please read this very carefully don't watch this film br br please
<START> if you enjoy the subtle yes i said subtle actions and reactions of john candy you can't help but like this film pronounced fillum by salvatore dipasquale the unobservant and uninformed watcher always saw candy as a broad actor a big buffoon and sometimes he was see stripes and splash but when given the opportunity he could really be razor sharp and quite subtle it's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we'll never get to see more of the other oh yeah the movie one can watch going berserk over and over i know i have with the frequency of caddyshack it's just that good the plot although a little convoluted is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind it allows candy and the always under rated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candy and they bounce hard definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candy's other work
<START> night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film and the 2004 remake of dawn of the dead only this time with the homeless the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie so now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac dr dre song california love overall a good episode br br 8 10
<START> carnosaur 3 is bad awfully bad bad to the point where it is funny how matter how much i try to convince myself i just can't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons i mean come on even the cover is bad ok the special effects are absolutely ridiculous those carnosaurs are really ridiculous a scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast yet when you see them run they run at the speed of an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can and the explosions are funny there is no other word to describe it at the beginning a bullet hits a jeep after a guys says what was that and the other explosions are also laughable but the worst thing is the screenplay and the so called story you don't expect a good story or i don't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie but at least the story has to try to make sense i mean how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent incredibly hard if you look at this oh and if you think that it's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters tell it to the writers of this awful awful piece of crap i mean what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead and they do lots of it and if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action packed wake up this movie is incredibly dull the carnosaurs who invented this lame name anyway attack in boring action sequences where you don't see much happening the soldiers think of how to beat them in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but can't seem to convince even just one second so then they attack the carnosaurs but their idea doesn't work another laughable action sequence back to planning with a few lame jokes thrown in in another ridiculous scene and this goes on and on and on and let's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects and the story oh ok this movie simply sucks from a to z br br
<START> laughs adventure a good time a killer soundtrack oscar worthy acting and special effects animitronics like none other what else could you want in a movie if you see this will be on the telly watch it otherwise run out now to rent it
<START> i tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted i'm a professional actor and i was flabbergasted by the performances they felt totally improvisatory absolutely without affectation i could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the imdb to find this film do not miss it i see that the writer director also did a very fine film called everyday people which i enjoyed a lot the shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar this film deserves to be flown high and proudly i urge people to look it up and watch it
<START> zentropa is the most original movie i've seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von trier's follow ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor it's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future it's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
<START> henry thomas showed a restraint even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could've killed this movie that kept the dignity of a redemption story and as for pure creepiness sniffing babies
<START> i haven't seen bsg i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it however i saw caprica rebirth yesterday i felt a little lost so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as well br br but what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what's going on in caprica from what i have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men and at least in my case it worked br br however i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot
<START> this movie was way too slow and predictable i wish i could say more but i can't if you enjoy action adventure films this is not one to see i'd suggest you go see movies like behind enemy lines with owen wilson and iron eagle with louis gossett jr
<START> world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time the historical research is virtually flawless even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2 an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war i highly recommend it as a learning experience
<START> i haven't always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go ould system lords were killed by rival lords sg 1 or others br br towards season 5 stargate sg 1 was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise the show became more and more solid br br the characters had become stale as well colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o'neill's weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go'ould ra the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends in br br amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter's strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently br br christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal'c teal'c was an alien called the jaffa infant go'ould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the jaffa would die teal'c was the first prime of apophis' army knowing that apophis was not a god like go'ould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the go'ould christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character teal'c is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra'tac the show would not be complete without master bra'tac played by tony amandola he is also a rock in the end he became adviser to most of sg 1 especially daniel jackson br br don s davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesn't leave anyone behind br br i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing shanks i don't think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson they don't talk about spader they talk about shanks in the early years the jackson character came off as a whiner that's why i probably wasn't a fan as the seasons pasted the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season 10 the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero he still monitors the groups ethics he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward acheaology history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement br br other characters include most recently vala mal doran claudia black and colonel cameron mitchell ben browder new lead of sg 1 both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and crichton farscape character black's character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon
