<START> my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world or at least those who will read this that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid you could say i suffered watching it my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off i do not recommend this to anyone at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case it is not a comedy it is not drama it is not action it is not horror it is just horrible
<START> iÂ´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time or third this movie is exactly what it promises to be lovely amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends the plot might be not very inventive but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit so the sparks are on all the right places supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening
<START> 9 the film i've been looking forward to for months was little more then a disappointment br br i was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development all the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character br br the strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were infuriating the story is about robots and scientists why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices br br how what when why questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater br br a film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth i would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good but the filmmakers have relied on cgi wizardry and tim burtons name to draw in the crowd which is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect br br 9 could have been awesome with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators
<START> this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits when i got agent under fire i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better but now there is a new type of james bond game this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions the graphics of the game are out of this house it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo and judi dench as m forgive me all if i spell it wrong this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around br br i give this a 10 10
<START> may contain spoilers so i watched this movie last night on lmn lifetime movie network which is not known for showing quality movies this movie is awful i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible could this movie contain any more stereotypes harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family's house mexican whores bad guy who is really a softie at heart incredibly bad country accents gag i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick's beauty i suppose pollack's and nemec's acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang i think that the accents were there in supporting characters like mary margaret's date and john and were unnecessary they were also very very bad i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful capitol building the ut tower lit up for a winning football game etc none of these things were there also it takes about 5 6 hours to drive to mexico from austin at one point in the movie michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican is there any other kind whores and then return to austin by dawn while this is theoretically possible it is not very likely and if anyone has started school in the hill country usually the third week of august but may have been in september in 1960 they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter jackets in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 degrees only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience
<START> this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and cafes it really doesn't stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style the story follows many lives too many for my taste and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your 120 minutes if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast
<START> this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast br br i am of course kidding
<START> what a bad bad movie i tried watching without fast forwarding that failed after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie went on line to see how many minutes this disaster was only 84 minutes whew it was a confusing boring movie i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one the one funny thing is that i watched the killer cut version of the movie the box boldly states more blood more sex more terror than the theatrical release yikes if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the un killer cut was if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series
<START> 'iphigenia' is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast cacoyannis achieved the impossible he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance a stellar greek cast helps him in this newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia equally impressive is irene papas who even though she sometimes seems over the top it is very realistic a wonderful greek film beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every scene br br p s rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote
<START> this movie stinks i don't think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value the plot was relatively interesting but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland this could have been an a good movie i think it just relied on it's grotesque visuals i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it just one poorly executed film there just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest pedophilia necrophilia rape self milking parental and sibling abuse and fecal dispersement i think i just sold the film to many of you but i meant it when i said this stinks he has succeeded in other films but i think you'd be better off watching someone pooping
<START> do not expect a depiction of the truth however the accounts of these veterans of the iraqi afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration br br the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives br br my major criticism of the film is twofold it is one sided and it advocates anti war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and veterans affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war these are not fatal flaws of the film br br as a veteran myself i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real and these young men and women articulate it very well these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing
<START> the quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time pam dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue chip prospects and make this work of art a must see academy award winners brenda fricker home alone lost in new york a time to kill ben johnson the last picture show red dawn and adrien brody the pianist the village amplify the atmosphere of the movie drawing in an anxious audience however the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster jay o sanders jfk the day after tomorrow br br the story is centralized around a foster child up and coming actor joseph gordon levitt brick the lookout sidekick milton davis jr delivers a tear jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents the two don't have much but what they do have angels' baseball and what they are seeking identity that's when 4 time emmy nominee danny glover lethal weapon predator 2 comes in to save the day as frustrated angels manager george knox in relation all characters in the story seem to have the same mission search within themselves to find out who they really are br br depressed over the fact that roger jgl is separated from his father he wishes to god for reunification if the angels can take the pennant odds are astronomical but 3 time emmy winner christopher lloyd back to the future my favorite martian comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic pun before you know it al lloyd is sitting with roger in the stands snacking on cracker jacks and causing some of baseball's biggest boners dorothy kingsley and george wells' dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind william dear nominated in directors guild of america he includes a touching side story centered around pitcher mel clark played by tony danza 4 time golden globe nominee emmy nominee who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused anaheim clark has been dubbed a wash up a once big name in cinci but he has something to prove to manager knox br br spoiling this nail biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century this one is a diamond in the rough and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace did i mention a cameo by matthew mcconaughey a time to kill we are marshall for all you ladies out there
<START> i used to be an avid viewer until i personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the white family only to be sickened to see the house a year later all of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down sprinkler system has been ripped out it now looks like a disaster area they don't even live there any more they live in town and come out only for the weekend it sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result the story that we all saw on tv wasn't completely the truth don't believe every thing you see and hear
<START> clint eastwood is bronco billy the leader of a wild west troupe one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling to break even touring show the seventh member of the bunch is a woman billy's assistant but such women never last long and the position is chronically open enter antoinette lilly sandra locke Â eastwood's girlfriend at the time it seems miss lilly as doc scatman crothers calls her is a would be heiress who will only receive her long deceased father's estate if she's married by the time she turns 30 so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish geoffrey lewis br br so what's the plot of this film it's hard to say there's the romantic tension between billy and miss lilly but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she's so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes 'one of the troupe' halfway through the film it's not only unbelievable but the audience is well past caring about her there's the chronic lack of funds behind the wild west show but this topic isn't touched upon enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film there's miss lilly's predicament of being stranded in the rural west cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury she's mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press but are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort br br no the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin this is a warm fuzzy film Â or at least tries to be br br along the way clint shows us his skills with a gun even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non violent film one of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge billy bribes the local sheriff the show's tent burns down an orphanage makes them a new one but numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make br br compounding the problem is the acting or lack thereof aside from scatman crothers the supporting cast is quite amateurish eastwood isn't on top of his game either though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch br br and for all this the film plods on for 116 minutes to what point good question Â br br 4 out of 10
<START> if i had never read the book i would have said it was a good movie but i did read the book who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline there is so many changes that it wasn't really worthy of the title character changes plot changes time line changes br br first off who was henry and the investigator they weren't in the story henry had mitch's persona somewhat but mitch wasn't a cop no you made it so roz helped 'sink ' his body and used that as zenia's blackmail against roz the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story neither i don't believe was his lover roz's secretary br br tony and west were not together in the beginning he was actually with zenia first while in college the black painted apartment was their idea tony just went to visit this is where zenia and tony meet become fast friends tony hides her love for west then zenia left west with cash from tony then west and tony get together eventually marry at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time only to be heart broken again then go back to tony zenia's blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia now being a professor at college she didn't want to let it get out i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully br br charis character was a blond not that it really matters zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive no she was there when charis had a lover named billy augusta's father he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal zenia and billy have an affair right under charis's nose while taking care of them both then zenia turns in billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him not with augusta charis was pregnant with her tho charis also had a split personality karen was her real name br br zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od'd she was also really dieing of cancer this time around br br it didn't show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader the book was striped down to its bare bones then re made in someone else's vision why couldn't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie it was different enough and i'm sure could have been made more so
<START> look i'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that i wanna say but i will try to make it short but clean br br first of all lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made how it didn't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was hollywood i mean what did you expect a real life story when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and biggie its all covered up and buried deep down br br second i'm not against neither 2pac or biggie i love them both but 2pac and lil kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure br br next for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies use your mind and see though the clouds there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic i did not say 60 of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit i mean a much better done but anyways i'm just some person giving her opinion no hard feelings br br look i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live with all do respect for 2pac and big like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth bringing the wrong message to the children and that is not going to school but living from the streets hustling and just grabbing for the paper br br the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence be smart and all br br ok i know that many of you will think that i'm crazy but this is just my point of view look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i'm in hip hop for 17 18 years i still don't know anything bout 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much i support them and listen to their music like most of you all out there only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this br br and for the end i just wanna say for all of ya biggie and tupac fans and family this two men were and will be the greatest of all time no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better learn and love each other think good even for the ones that don't like you because at the end its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top its about accomplishing your self to the fullest and feeding your soul your body and mind because if u manage to do that you will be living a life even after death peace and love to ya all rip biggie 2pac aaliyah left eye jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world
<START> this columbo episode is probably noted more for the director steven spielberg as one of his early films it should be looked at for jack cassidy's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle jack cassidy would appear in a later columbo after all columbo meets his match in jack cassidy's character he is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder after his first murder his next victim would be the annoying general store owner widow who would blackmail him for money rather than losing more money he kills her it is very entertaining to watch cassidy and falk as always falk's familiarity as columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years what television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters it's not about who does it how and why it the familiarness of columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself
<START> this is a ripsnorting old fashioned adventure yarn i understand that by today's political standards the treatment of the indians was unacceptable but this moving isn't about politics it's about action dialogue comradery acting direction music and photography and it's marvelous on all these factors grant fairbanks and mclaglen are electric together and jaffe is superb this is the ultimate buddy movie
<START> what an extraordinary crime thriller my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival it's already my second favourite film of all time after dr strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife br br i don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions a synopsis that i'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester new york the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time before during and after the robbery and one key scene is repeated at least three times ordinarily that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece the excitement the tension and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed by the end i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up i know that i've used a few clichÃ©s in this post but i literally was on the edge of my seat i should mention that the non linear storyline is quite easy to follow this isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie br br the acting is absolutely brilliant all around and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke don't look like brothers but that's a minor quibble that i can easily overlook hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric marisa tomei as hoffman's wife and albert finney as the father of hoffman hawke are also very good in supporting roles even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark gesture and facial expression by brian o'byrne and michael shannon Â absolute perfection the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i've ever watched and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes especially the ones with hoffman the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie often the same notes played over very effectively i had the music playing in my head the following day even as i sat through other films in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable major spoiler so i can't describe the scene otherwise this film is pretty darn close to perfect br br there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you're dead stands in a league of its own as an aside the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera shy that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene
<START> jackie chan name is synonomus to stunts this movie never let you down the opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder if he knows the meaning of fear this movie comes very close to jackie's best which is project a but the main difference being that project a contains three stars where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders this is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by bruce lee the film has nice comic touches too what makes this film work is jakie's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero this movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor
