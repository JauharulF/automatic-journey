<START> the school nerd marty simon scuddamore is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion set by them also where his face is scarred by acid years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school since closed for a reunion what they didn't know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them then a storm starts they're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge br br pretty silly the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school but that's about it the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel he's stripped has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt and are just uncomfortable to watch considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity there is full frontal of scuddamore surprising for any movie but one girl decides to take a bath alone after they know a killer is wandering around after them and then there's the couple that has to have sex this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv the acting is bearable not good but bearable caroline munro is in this too she's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress br br this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves
<START> i'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it there are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it give the film a real solid backbone add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner it has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery also the characters of marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole i'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs
<START> it's not so much that spontaneous combustion had little potential indeed the under explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this tobe hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can but somewhere between brad dourif's on again off again performance and the overly intricate plot this would be thriller loses its way br br dourif featured here before his built in horror fan base had accumulated is average guy sam of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well done origin outline we see sam's various body parts start to ignite soon he's igniting other people too much to the consternation of gal pal lisa played unmemorably by cynthia bain br br while the title of the film implies a fire happy monster on the loose director hooper opted to make sam an unwilling killer this approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower we're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight up villain versus everyone effort ala nightmare on elm street br br spontaneous combustion is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done it will carry added appeal for dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night
<START> the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jean marc vallÃ©e who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare br br taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life vallÃ©e instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal vallÃ©e takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching br br a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over encumbering it indeed while watching vallÃ©e's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well br br yet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereÂand indeed to most period dramasÂare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outings br br in the end it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable vallÃ©e never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a run of the mill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middle ground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> this i think is one of the best pictures ever made it's so pure and beautiful it really touched me i'm glad david lynch proved that a film doesn't necessarily need sfx a twisting complicated plot or flashy images way to go dave i'd like to see cronenberg do that
<START> during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the 'modern' segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our country's history albeit in a 'never was' framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits
<START> this movie was exactly what i expected not great but also not that bad either in my opinion pg13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room but nothing we all haven't already seen i guess i didn't like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive i also didn't understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about what i did like was the special effects other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it maybe its just me but i thought this was below average
<START> well what can i say br br what the bleep do we know has achieved the nearly impossible leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the postman the dungeon master merlin and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad movie br br this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti depressants to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new agy pseudo philosophy basically if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good weed then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for it br br the first thing that struck me about what the bleep do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera complete with pink heart effects computer generated sparkles across the screen and other assorted silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was permeated with cheesy gci the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over the counter video editing software but never would because it's just way too ridiculous br br the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information or rather disinformation which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping pills apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her anti anxiety pills specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down the acting well i've seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this it really did br br the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of kooky scientists kooky doctors and self proclaimed mystics go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life reality you see is a probability field of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it what happens when more than one observer observes they didn't say but then again who cares listen to enya meditate observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel universes and such br br speaking of rabbit holes the analogy permeates the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex actually the movie is extremely anti sex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and anti enlightening br br in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with br br i want 2 hours of my life back br br here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember br br what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics br br what does it take for one man to have an erection it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an erection some self proclaimed mystic head of her own school of enlightenment br br while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you you're fat you're ugly i have you main character the fat and ugly photographer
<START> i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres october sky feels and looks oh so familiar and it is all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better but despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn br br sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul just as the characters from steven sondheim's musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation what do you call it you call it a miracle sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale while jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines br br masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new especially affecting are subplots concerning homer's ailing young school teacher remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship also remarkable is the father son supblot that anchors the film perfectly played all around even homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking myrtle beach says it all br br a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money for once i agree with them you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again br br
<START> there is a bit of a spoiler below which could ruin the surprise of the one unexpected and truly funny scene in this film there is also information about the first film in this series br br i caught this film on dvd which someone gave as a gift to my roommate it came as a set together with the first film in the blind dead series br br this movie was certainly much worse than the first la noche del terror ciego in addition many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly to boot the movie was dubbed in english the first was subtitled which i tend to find distracting br br the concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the knights templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals upon discovery of these crimes the local peasantry put the templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used thus preventing them from returning from hell to exact their revenge we then jump to modern times where because of some event the templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise br br the templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century coming out of the crusades they were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the pope and others because they were secretive there were always rumors about their ceremonies particularly for initiation also because of the way the society was organized you didn't necessarily have church officials overseeing things which meant they didn't have an inside man when things heated up and because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into confessions the order was strongest in france but did exist in portugal and spain where the movies take place br br where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears you still have the same scene redone not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which i have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience there's also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the templars where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake which would date it around 1473 and the way that the templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well in the first they have them pecked out by crows now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous manner br br oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation but odd none the less br br the highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep the child's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep so he walks out and tells her to find her father it comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film of course why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans br br i couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone it isn't so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film the bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded when the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed if you are into the novelty of seeing a spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes
<START> warning review contains slight spoilers br br there's a parallel universe out there where gone in 60 seconds is a dark edgy controversial independent movie unfortunately in this dimension gone is a flashy vacuous testosterone fuelled moronfest starring nicolas cage br br for reasons not really worth getting into he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars only one of which has an alarm this crew consists of the guy with the funny shaped ears who's rumoured to be the new superman a guy who conducted electricity in the x files an ex professional footballer and two token black men br br their enemies are cops rival car thieves and bilborough from cracker his manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in frasier there's also angelina jolie who gets no character save to be a receptacle to men's sexual desires she and cage are supposed to be old flames which is odd as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film's overlong 135m running time br br in fact characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a violin plays in the background to accentuate the emotion it's no spoiler to reveal that vinnie jones who recreates his famous paul gasgoine hand ball manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny allegedly after he struggles through it in his not quite acting but it'll do london drawl cage quips i always thought you were from long island my ribs as you might imagine were well and truly tickled br br in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it the younger man who like the elder jive talks for the whole duration proclaims us black people don't like the cold we're tropical people he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots he is of course parodying the image of black people but how funny is that his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and thereby his colour in third person my black ass this my black ass that does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that thought not br br the film's soundtrack is played almost non stop and with increasing volume some of the tracks especially apollo 440's don't stop the rock so loud they're actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue the surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together no background music concept here it's the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast keep that music down young man br br this isn't the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it it's just that it's predictable lazy and witless with minimal effort in its construction apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie after being force fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact
<START> what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the u s cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it br br talking about the u s theatrical release along with the newly released blu ray disc version it's faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hip hop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone but the problem is hak hap black mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim super disturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the u s release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movie's undertone hk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish br br now let's talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg 13 rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie br br however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off it's a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screen writer there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you can't ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sado maso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans the u s cut was milder but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is 7 10 status inspiring hidden undervalued adult
<START> a mix of comedy romance music action and horror a knockout this is one of the reasons people rave about hong kong cinema if you're looking for something totally original look no further entertainment at it's peak
<START> i like silent films but this was a little too moronic as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i can't i don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book and don't try it out on kids they might freak and the lady who played pollyanna how old was she 38 i know the labor laws were different back then but come on people
<START> if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics spend your 9 on a used textbook not this movie i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool aid for shipment to guyana br br i don't think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several 1 science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are deterministic 2 science can't be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will 3 science is like really cool brother 4 we are god 5 the world exists only in our minds 6 sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff
<START> there has never been anything like it that's for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin' gary utah cross dressing sensation it is very self consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin' gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance he's trying to atone for his sins yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywood narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and re telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
<START> there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasn't supposed to be that way there wasn't really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast forwarded through the last 1 3 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a 0 of 10 yikes
<START> a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of there's something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5 day rental because i couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time br br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's missteps the checker at the save mart was great but the script writing is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need br br don't get me wrong slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there's something about mary one more time
<START> i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson but wasn't i said where's bill paxson then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director's alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased one guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up campers were successes in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one
<START> this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so br br there is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie the female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie i suppose it is 'funny' that luke's even uglier dorkier stupider friend is around but well that is what we get br br neither of the female leads would ever ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in friday the 13th 4 dead
