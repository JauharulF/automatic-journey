<START> do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p sed off about it br br the acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls make br br the majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s t die in the most horrible ways possible br br i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours don't do it
<START> i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor dr terrible's house of horrible garth marenghi's darkplace the mighty boosh snuff box many have imitated this show's style and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend with actors mark gatiss steve pemberton and reece shearsmith br br together they created royston vasey a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside where unsuspecting tourists and passers by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure where a gypsy circus kidnaps people and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on br br this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen by themselves the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were but it's also great acting the way they change their voices and their body movement the really become other people br br most of the jokes start with something ordinary from real life and then blows up into something unsettling sometimes gut wrenching sometimes it's pure horror without a set up like in papa lazarou's character just imagine a creepy circus owner on make up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives no explanation given it's that creepy then there are the numerous references to horror movies se7en the silence of the lambs nosferatu the exorcist etc br br fans of horror will love it fans of comedy will love it as any traveler entering knows there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey you'll never leave ' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree once you discover the league of gentlemen you'll never want anything else you'll never forget it
<START> quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv 8 april 2002 this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame br br what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www dvdbeaver com film dvdcompare2 kingofmasks htm br br wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw
<START> and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style br br this was senseless ridiculous rubbish br br its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen it is appalling br br nic cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films br br diane kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke she really can't act br br harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe br br only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world
<START> as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither but that even love is sometimes not enough but she tries
<START> this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal i believe that heaton is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see this br br i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences heaton shows great intimacy towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike's name on the top of his letters br br one thing i've noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it when they use phrases like who is heaton what's he doing with a retard like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having a d d although i don't think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term br br i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti heroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away
<START> this film has a lot of strong points it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi karloff chaney circle lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye plus leading man melvyn douglas it's got all the right ingredients bats a castle with lots of stone staircases a mad scientist townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires an igor type character a beautiful girl even a goofy haired burgomeister the soft focus camera work is moody and imaginative there's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script br br but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in kleinschloss little castle the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist nicely played by atwill who values his work more highly than human lives br br it's not top tier material because of a ho hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye but it's worth a look if you like early b w horror pictures
<START> this is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back and then some like the time you spent accidentally picking it out the time you spent getting to the video store etc br br first off the look it's grainy it's low budget now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film but the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural so that's kind of distracting br br then the story 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys of course as everyone does when going on a camping trip they stop on the way to get earrings when they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay they get pulled over by mr ranger sir who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season and then drives them where they're going a remote cabin of course 2 cute guys wander into their vicinity and bambi yes bambi and aubry are immediately smitten but apparently bambi is smitten by anything with two legs mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh faced and stoned with her gal pals br br oh and i almost forgot there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way that's perhaps someone to not tangle with and the area cabin in which they're staying have a sort of reputation br br so of course sooner or later unfortunately much later some of our weekend wood visitors begin to die and find various booby traps although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that and of course the remaining campers are understandably upset no cell phone reception of course who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore mr ranger sir keeps popping up at odd times his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help br br there's a fantastic twist to this that you just won't want to miss too if you're still awake pray that you wake up to a blank screen br br the acting in this is terrible the production values are terrible and the whole undertaking is just lame i find it amazing this was even released avoid at all costs 1 out of 10
<START> i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk to my dismay this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes which is not a problem to me as an adult but not good for watching with children this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes getting hit in the groin etc and for the most part of the film not very funny br br the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back br br up until now i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers but this film is certainly taking the biscuit br br a bit of good advice wait till it comes on tv or cable
<START> i don't like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli's attempt to adapt charlotte brontÃ«'s novel 'jane eyre' is a total waste of time br br the script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet noodle worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick br br joan plowright's mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out br br there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester's first wife the role of the would be second wife played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson is an empty cipher br br fiona shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as jane's aunt mrs reed she would have been better cast as mrs fairfax only amanda root as jane's beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br i saw this version of 'jane eyre' after viewing robert young's for british television made in 1997 starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan and gemma jones there is no comparison young's vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli's wet squib br br i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton about which i've read some very good things on this web site i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli's yorkshire picture book br br about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud
<START> okay as a long time disney fan i really hate direct to video disney sequels walt himself didn't believe in them he believed in and they lived happily ever after being the end of it but this one really ticked the taco there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this it wasn't funny quick summary if you don't already know melody the daughter of ariel and prince eric is born ursula's sister morganna who basically looks like ursula if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet shows up and after trying to do the newborn tyke in and failing prophesizes doom for the characters after that ordeal ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage and later on forbids her to go near the sea well surprise surprise melody finds out being the stubborn brat she is and runs away then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid in exchange for something gee does that sound familiar she becomes one but in her half of the bargain has to retrieve her granddaddy's trident and bring it back to the sea witch while doing this she runs into a couple of outcast animals a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb huh wait no that's not timon and pumbaa or is it could of fooled me anyway i'd like to reveal more but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does ok so long story short this movie borrows too much from other better disney films and does it horribly come on tip and dash why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff ugh not to mention the total character butchery of ariel's persona she's gone from being a freespirited headstrong woman to a clone of her father not good at all they're basically telling us the sweet firey little mermaid we've known to grow and love is dead plus melody herself isn't such a great character either she's damned annoying and bratty not to mention what they've done to flounder ugh anyway if you decide to see this piece of created mainly for profit reasons no imagination eisner sponsored c t i suggest maybe waiting 'till its on the disney channel or some other tv station because it's not even worth the price of a rental br br out of stars
<START> a pre code stunner with stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top these pre code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner father who sold more than booze to his patrons johns after the old man dies good barb heads for the big city for better things she uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top john wayne makes a poor cameo and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as lilly
<START> i watched this film sort of by accident having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd the omega man was a bit of a disappointment except for the beginning which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies but soylent green is in a whole other league i bet this is one of tarantino's favourites there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i've never seen anything like before heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor ok maybe that's been done since but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g robinson is this the most unlikely gay couple ever or what luckily i saw this film without knowing the ending which apparently is rare then i watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile a very nice script and some great sets too just when you thought you'd seen everything
<START> br br i'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is not a horror movie as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow i was especially disappointed with the ending though br br spoiler br br tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncle's home without at least calling the detective or the police first she knows exactly what's going on at that point plus she has a video tape as proof instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying i know everything i have proof you didn't expect proof did you then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her well duh of course he's going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what a dumb ending
<START> there isn't much in the way of spoilers since there isn't a plot to reveal but still i guess i describe some of what happens so this is it this is the most nonsensical film i've ever seen there are simply no words to describe this movie although bizarre ridiculous and ego trip are pretty close the opening half hour or so are really really weird music videos with absolutely no plot or continuity apart from that mj falls into some from the previous one of the highlights of this part of the film in the section where mj is flying a merry go round aeroplane through what seem to be half arsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine dear lord you could not make this up br br then with a little over an hour remaining the film begins with a lot of claymation some of it really creepy spotting our hero and chasing him looking for an autograph obviously this leaves our as of yet mute discounting songs lead somewhat worried and he manages to temporarily lose them fortunate for him because it means he can witness a falling star and and again i'm not making this up turn into a claymation rabbit he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them but for reasons i can't recall right now they see through it oh no and the creepy chase begins again cue another song big shock there br br shortly after the end of the chase mj somehow brings the rabbit to life until he is busted by a policeman in the middle of the desert because it is apparently illegal to dance there br br the rest of the film is equally as strange highlights including mj cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal including shooting a man with his finger not only killing the guy but burning his shadow into the wall a la nuclear fission weapons another good moment is when mj seeing mr big joe what the hell happened to his career at this point peschi kidnap one of the children he was friends with magically creates a tommy gun and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random opens fire at everything that moves a final moment i shall mention is when mj surrounded by mr big and his private army seriously this guy has dozens of people working for him and they're decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters which i guess they are how does he get out why he turns into a robot complete with weapons and shield this is the third of four transformations he makes almost always when backed into a corner and or on the run br br this film is quite quite surreal with little in the way of plot and virtually no continuity
<START> i'll say this much this director is all about raw images things most of us are not ready to confront head on images of sex suicide murder and people relieving themselves are constantly bombarding the viewer which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release although i don't think that i could ever see this movie again i will say that the director does have a good eye there were some really nice shots and picture moments in the film the fans the wire fish in their hair but the story left me needing more strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves what the heck did we just see br br note if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily don't see this film
<START> did not know what to expect from from van damme's partner friend trainer and his fight choreographer for most of his films it was nice to see him act as tong po in kickboxer and other van damme's films now he's on his own he and his wife make a great team in this one qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good really meanacing his wife was the writer producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action she also did good job editing the film together they did a great job the story made sense the fight scenes were edited well the leads were real fighters and looked good together the story came together well and if you can beleive it no bad language no sex just action a new one on me check it out
<START> paul verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director he started off making art house films in his native netherlands before moving to hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd 1983's the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the u s and it seems to have been a transitional film for him br br from the beginning of the fourth man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author gerard in a seeming homage to carol reed's similarly titled 1949 film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts the similarities end there however as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly in spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door's peephole that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he lie s the truth until he no longer knows whether something did or didn't happen br br the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which haven't occurred yet between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and verhoeven's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of don't look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny as gerard's deeply held catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality he naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the biblical delilah though he fears she'll remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis buÃ±uel blush he substitutes a man he's attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross br br the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his lying the truth the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience
<START> i went to see this film based on the review by siskel and ebert not only did i get duped but i took some friends along and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap after this i never went to see a movie based solely on siskel ebert's advice
<START> henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like it is a fooler through fonda's performance we are led to believe on the surface that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin but through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him br br in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940 br br the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war he goes forward into history the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous definitely worth seeing again
