<START> i see a lot of movies saw the original wargames years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in it's own way br br this one however looks like a low budget wednesday night special total crap from start to finish br br the plot is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie which i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie but hey with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting lots of clichÃ© scenes cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version br br bah no i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this do not watch this movie br br life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
<START> one of the best comedians ever i've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more my friends and family quote from this dvd so often you'd think we did nothing other than watch it the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage watch for the cake or death part joking about the church of england and the hitler pol pot part hard to explain just watch it the best part of the show may be eddie's facial expressions he can really say a lot with his eyes mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help huh fair warning eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four letter words in
<START> an excellent performance by alix elias highlights an otherwise mis directed and confused pile of dreck i have seen this movie perhaps 12 times and with each run through i find less and less pleasure why are munchies so lustful is that ever explained are they a reflection of our wanton boorish 'animal selves ' if they are why not make it more obvious why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie and make that connection explicit another part of this movie that bothers me to no end motorcycles the jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest 'street wise' traveler the sun glasses say 'pretty cool dude ' with all this i'm ready for easy rider meets the muppets all i get is munchies 1987 what gives stick to the gremlins series if you're a fan of diminutive wise cracking reptile puppets it'll give you the treatment you deserve
<START> i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a i r as it was know as back then thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don't have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was good attention to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to know the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and time but every one was having such a good time who cared
<START> a compelling honest daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape descent is a film that went under the radar due to its lack of distribution because frankly the film is so brutal in its depictions that if it had been released theatrically it may have met itself to some strong biased hate br br the film deserves to be discovered for not only its dark themes and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style but most of all for its performances chad faust is absolutely stunning bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one not relate to but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self it's a supporting performance that is so complex brave and emotional on faust's part and hard to forget br br however the standout is rosario dawson whose performance here is an absolute revelation a tour de force of realistic dramatic tics and one of the most subtle yet loud as can be performances in quite some time while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great to bad films she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances believably and thematically br br one of the best films of its year and 2007 was a strong one had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release i would be screaming praises for it as well as dawson and faust too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal films like this deserve better
<START> an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders although tragic episodes such as the highland clearances feature in the stories there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them it's all filmed in skye so there is a double dose of beauty the mountain scenery is breathtaking and it's a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken i'm english so i had to read the subtitles but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non actors in other words you are watching the real thing people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history the gaelic community especially on skye worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic folk history folk music oral culture scotland british history multi culturalism or social justice should go and see this film
<START> this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst it was worse than a student film super cheesy and i think the worst actor was the old lady at first i thought to myself well it's an old movie then i remembered that that is no excuse i've seen older movies with way better acting and such br br the music was terrible to it was really choppy the editing was poor most of the dialog was out of sync br br overall this movie doesn't even deserve a 1 i only watched it because i was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me it was just laughable my dead grandmother's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this
<START> when this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel there's nothing special here that you need to see story is about two married couples from arkansas who go on a trip together to reno couple number one is lonnie earl dodd billy bob thornton who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage his wife is darlene natasha richardson and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time lonnie has been sleeping with candy charlize theron who is the wife of his best friend roy kirkendall patrick swayze they all drive to reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite roy and candy have been trying to have a baby and finally candy discovers that she is pregnant but roy phones his doctor in arkansas and finds out that he's sterile candy and lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos this film is directed by jordan brady and he's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive unfortunately brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him this script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level just because they're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic thornton's character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar and swayze's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day penelope cruz pops up as a prostitute and it's a totally worthless and pointless cameo she barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines i think she was fulfilling an obligation to harvey and bob weinstein who are executive producers for this film the only person who actually isn't to bad is richardson we watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche all of these actors should know better and it's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it it's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid as for the viewers your not getting paid so skip this one
<START> i can't say this is the worst movie ever made but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters 1 the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it and we actually stood in line to get tickets and 2 it's still the only serious film i recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through once we reached the infamous and interminable snake fight scene i think everyone gave up br br the only positive i can concede is the lush location shooting oh and there's also bo's breasts although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a playboy pictorial br br the dramatic tension in this film is between bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed however this is one of those films that's bad enough it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor definitely the worst film i ever paid to see
<START> i have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure a horrible joke of a film i cringed throughout terrible trite distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths br br the famous hitler biographer ian kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film however he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and also demanded they stop using his name as a source it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved br br one scene shows hitler beating his dog there is not one source for this hitler loved animals above people he brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in europe banned vivisection and animal experimentation he was also a vegetarian br br the film turns his gaining of the iron cross into a farce involving bribery utter lies he was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time br br there are no historical documents showing that hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece not one br br apart from these hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick br br if he was even half as ignorant demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed never mind become the leader of germany br br honestly this film was utterly terrible br br go watch downfall and give this a very wide berth
<START> i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto a short film festival in guanajuato mexico one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white br br i shouldn't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing the sci fi story might be found average for many to me was really good the action is great the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully the cast performance is good in my opinion no one hits the wrong note br br now the thing that i found awesome is the animation 3d grafics look 2d a bw comic book brought to life the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth br br the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film 7 years the director she said is brilliant but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv so many people had true faith in them they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them br br don't miss it i think you won't regret it maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think
<START> without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost
<START> may 1938 hitler in italy preparations for historical appointment with mussolini emotions tensions and forms of self affirmation a empty town a housewife and a journalist the meeting of two different worlds refuge for a mother with a sad life short filling for a classical victim a story about solitude and silence about the form of of life's nooks and desire like fight's form the great character a book gifted in a spring's afternoon this movie is a poem remarkable for the art to describe the shades of common loneliness a pleading for a ineffable relation with reality and with your interior world the pictures of il duce the clumsiness of antonietta the patience and the frailty tension of gabriele the art of director to give the sense of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime foretaste of subtle delicacy a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict about essence of life and repulsiveness of any tyranny loren and mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting a clear masterpiece
<START> at first i didn't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie boy was i wrong my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all james gandolfini was funny i really liked christina appelagate and catherine o' hara was good too the storyline is what really sold me i mean too put up with family at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year and probably don't get along with anyway you really do need as much alcohol as you're system can stand to deal with christmas so i thought that the premise was good there buying the family with 250000 dollars was a little on the far fetched side but it turned out to work pretty good for me cause it was a riot all the way through it shows the class struggle of the different families it has lot's of funny moments including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too
<START> yep you read that right kids michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer br br thankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war era politics stereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh it's still a pretty damn cool little b movie they really don't make'em like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions br br for those who are unfamiliar here's the robo scoop we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed disputes between nations are now settled mano a mano or perhaps that should be machine o machine o by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays achilles the greatest robot jock in marketplace a k a the good guys history achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation i e the russkies the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale br br i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isn't robot jox is just plain fun i'll grant that it is a bit higher concept than your average b grade sci fi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green screen trickery it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire full moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion model techniques and the sets and costumes don't look half assed in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart re animator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a rock'em sock'em robot good time pick up robot jox instead
<START> kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one
<START> of course the average sci fi battle star gallactica fan will hate this that kind of makes me happy i don't like those cheesy sci fi shows especially battle star gallactica and that is why i like this show br br the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this the unconventional sci fi way and it was worth it i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci fi nerds br br this is probably the most promising show since lost it has the most interesting clever and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique br br what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime from young teens running around shooting guns to and extremely well balanced and complex script to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better most anime is too confusing
<START> the tweedy professor types thought they had it all figured out today's peoples who inhabit polynesia descended from migratory asians intrepidly moving from the far east island to island eastward into tahiti and all the other exotic tropic isles of the south pacific over thousands of years but the established thinking just didn't sit well with young norwegian ethnographer thor heyerdahl if that explanation were true how come some folks born and bred in those islands have traditions artwork and physical features resembling not those from asia but south america how can the vegetation of ecuador peru and chile look so much like what you'd find on the island several thousand miles away is it just a coincidence that the islanders point out to sea in the direction of south america and say that is where their ancestors came from led by tiki their equivalent of adam meanwhile how is it norwegians speak of scandanavian forerunners who were chased from the south american continent they had colonized and together with some of the native peoples they befriended set off over the sea heading west it's all too much to be a coincidence to heyerdahl with an amazing amount of moxie a handful of crewmen and the local know how for traditional raft building an expedition begins it's as much a trip into the human imagination as it is a pseudo scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the very basics of tools and seamanship the oscar winning documentary may be dated in its tone and anglo ethnocentric approach but it soars with a spirit of adventure besting even the space program that launched a decade later as men are willing to risk it all to test a theory they think is true wonderful do yourself a favor and read the book first it is an amazing page turner and the perfect setup for the newsreel style movie
<START> a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life br br if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this izod wearing dune buggy driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but he's up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob there's also a sub plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all br br the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck br br i've seen some pretty good italian crime cop flicks recently but mister scarface isn't one of them check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead
<START> terry gilliam gives a stunning movie which i thoroughly enjoyed bruce willis madeline stowe brad pitt and even the small appearance of christover plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top 10 i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies and brad pitt's best brad pitt delivers a perfect performance possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that i've ever seen he played his role geoffrey very convincingly bruce willis' role james cole was also quite convincing both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well with the brilliant story to back the great performances and to back that up terry gilliam's superb directing
