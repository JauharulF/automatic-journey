<START> this is a terrible production of bartleby though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book it tells the story almost painfully so watching it i could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation rather see the 2001 version of bartleby featuring crispin glover that version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel what's important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes the difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mind numbing schlock
<START> as has been stated countless times the hills have eyes 2 is not a remake of the generally disregarded mid '80s sequel to wes craven's 1977 original but wishing to give this postmodern sequel to a remake the official stamp of diminishing returns craven himself a double threat alongside his son jonathan has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality in plain english horrible former music video director martin weisz takes the reins from alexandre aja and is clearly in way over his head yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the cravens' screen writing 101 scrawl not only are the characters in this case a gang of goofball national guards wo men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls played without a lick of irony mind you but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny after viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise their fate against the repulsive roaming cannibals is painfully obvious only this time out as in the original '80s sequel the script is so simplistic barely existent actually that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks we're treated to a combo childbirth murder during the opening credits plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't ejected the dvd by the midpoint even the mutants in this outing are personality free freaks of no memorable stature the tacky rubbery looking makeup fx seems like the rest of the film to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment i really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of aja's otherwise excellent film and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of hills 2 setting the stage very lamely setting the stage for a third installment yet the cravens and weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977 2006 versions work that they'd be hard pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face
<START> just a comment on new orleans accents br br an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer br br many people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why it's mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often it's just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent
<START> there just isn't enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd br br the whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and i'm a moron don't believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn't deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren't the best but they just didn't have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed
<START> to be honest i knew what to expect before i watched this film and i've got to say it has the worst acting i've ever seen it does have its moments and on a comedy level its very entertaining but i'm afraid its not scary and stupidity is taken to a new level there's a lot of unnecessary gore and the plot is all over the place i have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they even came to this remote part of wales i mean who'd go there anyway but i didn't care at that point because i was amused by the costumes and the bad cgi as far as b movies go this deserves the title of 'being so bad its good' and kudos to the film makers because they probably knew what they were doing long may these films continue
<START> here's yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country these atheist filmmakers are relentless here we see a brutal blasting of catholics and or the catholic clergy and i am not catholic br br this won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film that's probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else he's portrayed as nothing but an idiot no wonder the secular dominated academy loved this movie br br also there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story the daughters take turns seducing the seminary student who states he studied for six years but says he's an agnostic i mean how blasphemous is this film br br this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular progressive bigotry of the film business worldwide not just hollywood
<START> this movie is an abomination and its making should have been considered a capital crime br br one of the great mysteries of film making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery it is a tale of a really gripping mystery nice old fashioned romance and dry english humor why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon's struggle to save the accused etc etc these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product
<START> i shouldn't even review this movie since it's not actually a horror movie and thus not worthy of dr cheese's attention at least it's not horror in the usual sense it's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap that's why i turned it off after the first four hours imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed yep that's right in plain terms this movie is b o r i n g br br the order had lots of flaws not all of them unique in particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious subgenre of horror films is hollywood's unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox just ask william peter blatty in fact without orthodoxy films like this are just an anything goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers' usually dull and illogical imaginations br br think about it if someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot the same goes for these sorts of movies br br in other words the order and many similar movies before it invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions unsurprisingly the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing br br avoid this steaming pile
<START> the waiting womans ward of a large lying in hospital with all its joys and sorrows is the place where life begins br br this nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera replete with comedy and tragedy all tied into the lives of the maternity staff and their patients the frankness with which the subject matter is handled points up the movie's pre code status br br marvelous aline macmahon as the sympathetic head nurse is the calm center of the film the rock around which all the currents flow able to handle any crisis or emergency she is the mothers' best sometimes last friend surrounding macmahon is a bevy of excellent costars loretta young as a convicted murderess released from prison long enough to give birth eric linden as her frightened young husband brassy glenda farrell as a dame who hates children sweet clara blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birthing preston foster hale hamilton as thoughtful compassionate doctors and frank mchugh as a comically frantic father to be br br movie mavens will recognize bobs watson as a wee tyke who wants to see the stork paul fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a little soldier ' gilbert roland as a distraught italian husband and elizabeth patterson as a snooty doctor's wife interested in adopting farrell's son all uncredited br br there are a few absurdities in the plot some of the mothers are obviously much too old farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the ward but none of the staff seem to notice an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious
<START> i haven't seen all of jess franco's movies i have seen 5 i think and there are more than 180 of them so maybe it's a bit early to say so but necronomicon getrÃ¤umte sÃ¼nden better known as 'succubus' but that is the cut version is according to me if not the best certainly on of franco's best franco is best known although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated for vampiros lesbos a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the cucumber' 'vampyros lesbos ost' jess franco is an overwhelming director when the phone rang during 'vampiros' i let it ring i just wanted to see more of the movie since that moment franco never could grip me that much but then i stumbled on this movie it is even better than vampiros lesbos i think franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera we find out he can do a lot i certainly didn't expect to find necronomicon that great its beginning didn't impress me at all remember i had seen vampiros lesbos before although chronologically that came only three years later and both movies kinda start the same but then the story went on puzzling and gripping beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn't old fashioned the man says that all movies have to be old fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed but the girl replies that bunuel fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon a franco regular is also there luckily the acting is good something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you but not this one but certainly watch out for the dummy scene the erotic tension the wild directing and the fact that it's a yesterday's movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see the fact that it is a bit more accessible than vampiros lesbos certainly helps
<START> yes this gets the full ten stars it's plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent trent harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone
<START> this british film is truly awful and it's hard to believe that glenn ford is in it although he pretty much sleepwalks through it the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film no action no movement just a static train the area where the train is parked is evacuated so it's not like there's any danger to anyone either in fact this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don't a fact apparently unknown to the director spoiler the train actually has two bombs on it but we are led to believe there is only one after the first bomb is defused it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more but at the last minute the villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals there are two nor are we certain when the bombs will go off so we don't even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn ford's french wife thinking about leaving him and then wondering where he is she's such an annoying character that we don't care whether she reconciles with him so when she does there's nothing emotional about it most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality and none have any problems or issues it's only 72 minutes but it feels long because it's tedious and dull don't waste your time
<START> you can be fooled by your first impressions as in initial reactions to a movie for example as in the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it first of all i love black comedies could even despite being male myself empathise with the feisty girls' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay was tripped up by my own face value and i do mean face value response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad and not bad good either the reason i'm giving this movie a 4 rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams the rest of 'er is pretty good too but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it i don't think it's a total waste of time but
<START> this movie stinks the stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long i can't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film whew
<START> the film version of alice walker's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel written largely as letters from the central character celie to god was a massive oscar success and rightly so br br in the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert celie's abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preacher's wife and the much missed carl anderson otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar as preacher samuel br br beautifully paced and sensitively written 'the color purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature length drama
<START> first let me state that i am a big fan of ashley judd that's why i was curious to check out this her debut role no argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent i guess i can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story however i like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails br br by the halfway point i found myself thinking how much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop rearranging the merchandise it seemed to go on forever br br then i thought maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event no such luck the movie continues it's bland boring uneventful story all the way to the end br br i'm not saying this because i'm an action junkie i like all kinds of movies especially romantic comedies but i expect to be entertained br br add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies depressing br br i just don't get how anyone could like this movie zero entertainment value the longest 114 minutes of my life br br
<START> i don't understand people why is it that this movie is getting an 8 3 i had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen or of the summer year etc they say it's an excellent conclusion wtf what has been concluded besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across what do you learn about bourne's character in this movie absolutely f nothing okay there's a lot of action but what's so great about the action in this movie i don't like the cinematography and film editing the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast i didn't mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess and made me quite dizzy i was quickly wishing i had saved my for something else br br this movie has no plot all this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen bourne who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie is a perfectionist at everything he attempts there is absolutely no character development in this movie you know nothing about anyone and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense what writing what suspense there's no suspense bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does i don't think he has anything to worry about if this is the best movie of the year 2007 i may just quit watching movies entirely br br many people have also said that matt damon's performance in this movie is one of the best if not the best of his career what performance how many lines did he have in this movie i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next someone who chooses different types of roles not someone who plays the same roles over and over again which damon doesn't do but an example of someone who does is vin diesel br br anyways this movie was a big disappointment to me i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two bourne identity and bourne supremacy and i most definitely recommend reading the three books which are much different then the movies
<START> this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold it's horror but not a splatterfest it's equal part suspense as well as horror yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera br br the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters br br forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe that's a red herring he is acting here 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance so she must believe the script has something to say we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap cut and get their paychecks this is not the case here br br forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo funny regularity i don't think the intent was humorous but to keep you off balance br br think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage that decrepit whitewashed house then you might see it's really about paranoia fear and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace usa br br and it is twisty time travel mind control secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead yet br br i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down
<START> the sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the 'message' of the bible without any alteration or extra biblical influence the existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing br br if you want to know what the born again branch of christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cults and sects it's quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid br br poor acting uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick paranoid christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the evangelical scene you could not really put this into the 'so bad it's good' category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid
<START> people who actually liked problem child 1990 need to have their heads examined who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny the movie is not funny ever in any way beginning to end it wants to be a cartoon but the writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people get attacked by bears or hit with baseball bats it may be funny in cartoons but not in a motion picture br br the film's young hero is junior michael oliver who since he was a baby has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption the families reject him because junior tends to give them a hard time br br he is then thrown into an orphanage where he terrorizes the nuns and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow tie killer michael richards he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy the late john ritter and his wife amy yasbeck who are dying to have a child in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood br br junior becomes a member of the healy household and little ben takes an interest in him despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site or throws a cat at his father big ben jack warden a bigoted politician br br i think that we're supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people his new mother flo is a bitch his grandfather is completely selfish and one little girl who despises adopted kids is such a spoiled brat br br but what junior does to get the last laughs isn't funny it's mean cruel and sometimes life threatening br br and what is the film's message that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers they definitely don't what it's like to be a bad kid junior isn't a one he's just a sadistic little twerp there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others now everybody's laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat br br it's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a family comedy what's worse is that problem child is rated pg what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this there's a lot of profanity and mean spirited pranks here that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg 13 br br kids will enjoy this but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen and to most people problem child will be considered a guilty pleasure classic a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking even though the prevailing opinion as put forth by more serious viewers is that the movie is a piece of crap
