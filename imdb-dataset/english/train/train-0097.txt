<START> not really a big box office draw but i was pleasently surprised br br with this movie james i did some things to farrah fawcett orr br br co wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary average guy br br named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been br br incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game br br when he was 15 but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender br br mike larry gets his wish yet soon realizes that his new life br br isn't exactly as he hoped it would be br br i must say this movie really impressed me critics have given br br it mixed and i must say the concept is really interesting and br br pulled off well yes it is a little standard but packs enough br br funny moments drama and excellent acting to make it really br br good james belushi i think was oscar worthy for his role jon br br lovitz is perfect and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in br br their roles michael caine is perfect as the bartender it's br br just a good movie with a good lesson if you've never seen i br br highly recommend you check
<START> our song' gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha maria and joycelyn best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain crown heights brooklyn is was the same for us all a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school welcome heat and idleness br br but if this experience of adolescence is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies carving new silhouettes beckoning new territory the maze towards adulthood the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it is was always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s br br jim mckay is the writer director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him the opening title slide a film by' seems to list everyone in the universe it's a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and appreciative credits i've read the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted mckay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story it's his three graces lanisha maria and joycelyn they're the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare br br hanging out with them we don't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life we are witness to the modern math of teenage life how its problems are interpreted calculated and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job it's the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood in a connected scene lanisha defends her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams and we remember how crazy funny kids are and more tragically how realism hammers idealism these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable br br our song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship how one day alive and enlivening that intimacy can in the next just turn and drift away it's awful but that's just the way it is isn't it
<START> i really like richard gere i always have and it seems as of late that his status as a hollywood star and money maker has slipped but it would appear to me that the reason is that he is taking very mature intense roles and has been very successful at it just not financially because i have seen him in some truly great gems as of late including the hoax the hunting party both must see films see my reviews and now this the flock which apparently was meant to be a big release considering it's substantial 35 million budget it seems that some of the other imdb reviews are very very harsh because i thought the film dealt with a potentially very serious social issue in a very direct violent and disturbing way and gere just brings it all home it's an action thriller drama that kept my glued to the television with it's story i think part of the problem that people seem to have with it is that it hollywood izes a very serious issue but i don't think it does it with disrespect but rather tries to take a different spin to make people aware that this exists in fact it's much the same way that the hunting party dealt with war hong kong director wai keung lau did a decent job holding it together but i think the cast is what made it watchable br br richard gere as you may have guessed from my previous comments is brilliant as a social worker of sorts erroll babbage who has kind of created his own style and laws when it comes to keeping track of his flock who are registered violent sex offenders he holds no punches in tracking these people following them and making absolutely sure they don't re offend and if they do he'll be the one to identify and stop them any way he can gere is so intense and looks drained from this job and he's become violent and angry at watching these monsters loose on the street he is just fantastic claire danes is also terrific as babbage's new partner and his replacement who he has to train to do his job danes' character is far more typical social worker and is a little taken aback by babbage's style and methods but slowly realizes what he is trying to accomplish and go up against the two of them are brilliant together and have terrific chemistry with such vastly different characters kadee strickland plays a disturbed registered offender who appears to be torn from the headlines as she plays a character very reminiscent of karla homolka paul bernardo's wife who is now out for those of you who follow canadian serial killers her character goes a little over the top but she is convincing and horrifying all at once russell sams has a small role as strickland's new boyfriend and he would have been better probably given a bigger role ray wise who is a terrific character actor check him out in dead end as well as the amazing turn as satan himself in the wb show reaper and he gets a small but good role as the head of the public safety department and babbage's boss br br the movie isn't perfect despite the terrific performances of it's lead cast it takes liberties by really trying to make the film more entertainment than educational but it's just a different angle not unlike the nicholas cage dud 8mm the flock takes you into the underbelly of the sex trade kidnapping human trafficking and more and is just really something to watch perhaps it wasn't directed or written as well as it could have been but i am telling you that danes and gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller it's disturbing but also something that isn't very complex and yet gere's character in many ways is intensely complex with many layers and also opens social stigma and makes you contemplate about vigilantism in many ways when you see the people gere deals with i encourage you all to ignore poor reviews and see it for yourself because it's worth checking out 8 5 10
<START> i love this movie and never get tired of watching the music in it is great any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack with rockers like gene simmons and ozzy osbourne you can't go wrong
<START> stories of the century was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the '54 '55 television season it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award starring veteran western actor jim davis as railroad detective matt clark the series set clark and his fellow railroad detective partners mary castle as frankie adams for the first half of the season and kristine miller as jonesy during the second half against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid 1860's to the early 1900's the series was very satisfying easy to watch and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of jim davis in the lead role he seemed like an actual western character one other note when matt clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust br br a very good early adult western
<START> kate miller angie dickinson is having problems in her marriage and otherwise enough to see a psychologist when her promiscuity gets her into trouble it also involves a bystander liz blake nancy allen who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer br br dressed to kill is somewhat important historically it is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through hide and seek 2005 it's odd then that director brian de palma was basically trying to crib hitchcock for example de palma literally lifts parts of vertigo 1958 for dressed to kill's infamous museum scene dressed to kill's shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to psycho 1960 de palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of hitchcock's favorite composer bernard herrmann the similarities do not end there br br but de palma whether by accident or skill manages to make an oblique turn from or perhaps transcend his influence with dressed to kill having an attitude structure and flow that has been influential maybe partially because of this influence dressed to kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time countless subsequent directors have taken their hitchcock like de palma and honed it improving nearly every element so that watched now after 25 years' worth of influenced thrillers much of dressed to kill seems agonizingly paced structurally clunky and plot wise inept br br one aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn't been improved is dressed to kill's sex and nudity scenes both dickinson and allen treat us to full frontal nudity allen's being from a very skewed angle and de palma has lingering shots of dickinson's breasts strongly implicit masturbation and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films quite a few scenes approach soft core porn i'm no fan of prudishness quite the opposite our culture's puritanical monogamistic sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me so from my perspective it's lamentable that dressed to kill's emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts br br de palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than de palma does it he has an odd characteristic approach to close ups and he's fond of shots from interesting angles such as overhead views and james whale like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets of course later directors have been flashier but it's difficult to say that they've been better viewed for film making prowess at least the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following kate through the intricately nested cubes of the metropolitan museum of art br br on the other hand from a point of view caring about the story and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache as well as cultural facts external to the film the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risquÃ© once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the film's eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clichÃ©d and occasionally hokey br br the performances are mostly good although michael caine is underused and dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like but the exit is necessary and very effective dressed to kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasn't exactly aged well at this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example but not the best even for that era of some of de palma's directorial flair
<START> this is far more than the charming story of middle aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing although it is that as well it's the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud a few where you'll want to get up and tango and many others where you'll just feel good br br this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are heavy and inaccessible br br
<START> i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasn't far off there's a fair amount of glimpsed gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didn't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasn't so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and setting br br don't get me wrong it's still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go it's a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster
<START> fidois a very odd film and in many ways a very good one br br my first thought after viewing was how the hell are they going to market this thing if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies doesn't exactly trip off the tongue br br fido has little of shaun's carnage gore belly laughs it is a different beast altogether forgive the pun br br fido kicks off with a black white information film that explains the back story humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh eaters into dumb servants br br at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matinÃ©e but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle class nostalgia br br young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school his mom is would be social climber and his dad is nervy and detached br br seeking to keep up with the joneses mom carry anne moss has acquired a zombie jimmy is disinterested at first but 'fido' billy conelley soon proves a great buddy for jimmy until his collar goes on the blink br br fido is not a horror film but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is br br much of the humour is of the light family variety and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog family moments br br yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark truly funny moments which while welcome will ensure an r rating for what is for extended periods a family comedy br br the film looks gorgeous and is wonderfully performed by all involved br br despite its difficult tonal problems i hope this movie finds a niche as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap

<START> i've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd to be honest i really don't know what the problem with it is br br it's a decent murder mystery thriller shown from various points of view from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers suspects including the late porn king john holmes please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis br br many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don't see it many modern movies were worse saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes afterall br br i was enthralled with both halves of the movie the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath the movie has excellent acting even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality br br the soundtrack was also awesome a fantastic mix of 70's b side rock and obscure pop spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights
<START> mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role well said she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title card needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning indeed in my opinion the movie itself rates as one the all time great experiences of silent cinema br br true director john s robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish but in robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective a creative artist of the first rank robertson is a master of pace camera angles and montage he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career true it's probably not the way mrs white intended but it serves the plot admirably as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother in law needless to say this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug middle class christianity notice how the well washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented br br tess also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress gloria hope whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children lloyd hughes died in 1958 but she lived until 1976 easily contactable in pasadena but i bet no one had the brains to interview her another opportunity lost br br to me forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this he usually played priests or judges but david torrence as usual was superb br br in all an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values
<START> i remember this show being on the television when i was a kid back in the early 1990s and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs it was called power rangers i remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences br br i never really thought of this as a show especially when better shows like the tick were playing on fox kids most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner and it's not hard to wonder why the footage is ridiculous at best the colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense then you get into the acting and of course those really laughable haircuts all the guys run around with earrings on half of them are wearing 90's mullets and they always wear the same clothes everyday and then change into leotard wearing power rangers br br the toys are especially ridiculous as well and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts and of course two of the worst movies ever made and i do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films and the shows it was based on br br power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising as an adult i don't look at it fondly but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows fashion and guys' earrings
<START> scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately such as minotaur or dog soldiers grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf however it deviates so much and offers so little in comparison that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty christopher lambert movie' i wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production but i did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots br br did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing did any research go into this obviously not as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew save for mullet boy are wearing one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendelÂif beowulf is supposed to wrestle him shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way Â in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script for example grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf Â not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs and grendel's motherÂdid they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds and honestly what the hell was with that mullet br br if you want to see this movie because its connection to the epicÂ don't as there really isn't one other than character names the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie druids directed by jacques dorfmann Â although i don't recommend watching either
<START> cccc is the first good film in bollywood of 2001 when i first saw the trailer of the film i thought it would be a nice family movie i was right salman khan has given is strongest performance ever my family weren't too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him rani and preity are wonderful the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars br br it's about raj salman khan and priya meeting and falling in love they get married and go to switzerland for their honeymoon when they come back raj and priya find out that priya is pregnant raj's family are full of joy when they find out especially raj's dada amrish puri raj and his family are playing cricket one day and priya has an accident which causes priya to have a miscarriage raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor balraj chopra prem chopra he tells raj and priya that she can no longer have anymore kids raj and priya keep this quiet from the family raj and priya decide to go for surrogacy surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to raj and priya raj finds a girl her name is madhubala preity zinta she is a dancer and a prostitute raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees raj changes madhubala completley raj tells priya that he has found a girl madhubala and priya meet and become friends they go to switzerland to do this so no one finds out priya spends the night in a church and raj and madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together the doctor confirms that madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy raj tells his family that priya is pregnant they are happy again madhubala comes to love raj and she wants him what happens next watch cccc to find out br br the one thing i didn't like about the film is their idea of surrogacy they should have done it the proper way in the film but it didn't ruin the film it was still excellent br br the songs of the film are great my favourites are chori chori chupke chupke dekhne walon ne deewana hai yeh mann and mehndi the song mehndi is very colourful in that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful the film deserves 10 10
<START> the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable nothing has changed in fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting br br i even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england can he not insinuate himself on the australian police it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation br br the latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible sometimes bordering on silliness and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one sad

<START> late one night on a desolate road in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers who've killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy's girl br br writer director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy but i'm glad he did it no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again br br i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties though guilty of some bad acting this is earnest enough and unpretentious making it hard for me to dislike br br the whole production is a bit odd though but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable
<START> lovely piece of good cinema this is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why well one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today and he is able to film emotions br br when you are watching the film you can feel what mr straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his marvellous john deere what changed in his mind what changed in your mind when you watched this film br br a beautiful fraternal love story
<START> had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix i'd have a couple of hours of my life back i'm frankly suspicious when i see that a film's director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were a few interesting moments e g judy tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy ism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i'd seen the whole thing nope though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless i found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended
