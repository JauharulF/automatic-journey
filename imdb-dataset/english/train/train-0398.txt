<START> i started to watch this movie with high expectations however after one hour i gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me this already started in the opening sequence and only got worse br br why would they bury the hollander under a statue why is there an italian comediant present why did the farmers wife save the hollander why did he upon being saved not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife why did the farmers wife not save the hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand italian why did the italian comediant know about the hollanders gold why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property these and many more questions popped up and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way so i guess i am totally missing the point of this movie and i am not connecting to the story in any way
<START> while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very lame movie basically a rehash of siegel's coogan's bluff with the main difference being that clint eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker an unappealing actor if there was one br br however venantino venantini is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget vittorio gassman he is the main reason to sit through this steampile as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl poor old rossano brazzi hard to believe he was once a romantic lead watch mondo cane to see him running away from women looking here like a second tier ben gazzara he's given next to nothing to do it's all joe don's show unfortunately and all of it scored to generic 80's action movie music that couldn't be more boring br br greydon clark can make good b movies without warning but here he trips falls breaks his nose and loses three teeth well at least the malta locations were nice and there's venantini to try to save the day 3 10
<START> dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until it s first broadcast on network television tonight actually seeing as i m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe my theory was proved right for the most part br br minor spoilers br br what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved for example early in the film the bad guys are flying dracula s coffin from london to america in a twin engine turbo prop plane and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where dracula comes to life a fight breaks out there s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don t hear a sound until the script demands it it also appears in this segment s climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses sloppy scripting and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there s numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced br br there s something else that yanked my chain product placement there s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label retailer chain is in full view i won t dare publicise the company brand except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british broadcasting guidlines and i m surprised the bbc showed this movie if that s the case br br there are some positives in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot but it s something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years a very good looking movie that s very dumb
<START> justin goes home to live with his strict hard nosed police detective father but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments each with bizarre tenants residing in them straight laced idealist justin is thrust into the world of the occult murder under aged drinking and other dastardly things ho hum br br wow have i seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw clever compelling original intense clever genius i witnessed none of those things what i did see was an uninteresting bland trite extremely clichÃ©d low budget thriller that was ripe with implausibilities and no tension in the least bit as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film as he gives his monologue debate discussion and where are these humorous laugh out loud moments i never so much as chuckled perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film br br my grade d br br dvd extras audio commentary with director dave campfield second commentary with various contributers as well as isolated music tracks 4 featurettes making of on the set turning 1 room into 4 inside the black circle interviews with felissa rose desiree gould raine brown alternate scenes bloopers a music video for 'addiction' a trailer for this movie and trailers for shock o rama chainsaw sally skin crawl sinful bacterium creature from the hillbilly lagoon millennium crises
<START> i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day and the day after that i've watched it 3 4 times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss the main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily sympathized with to the person who complained that there wasn't enough 'spark' in this film i'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion br br i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him the other man says you can't go back alone and lends the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room br br the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral as the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones the older man won't even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it crreeepy usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people as has been mentioned the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening and i feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is reassuring to see others feel the same i can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype br br i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man whew i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling aaww yeah any other films to recommend br br thanks
<START> panic is kind of a crime comedy drama with william h macy donald sutherland and neve campbell in the leading roles alex played by macy is a guy who kills people for living but for the moment he's facing a depression and that's why he is seeing a therapist that's where he meets sarah neve campbell and he falls in love with her he's also facing another problem he wants to quit the family business the killings but he doesn't now how to tell this to his father br br what follows is the story of a guy during he's midlife crisis facing the regular problems falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that goes with that br br pretty good acting performances by the cast macy is excellent as the depressed alex i had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie but he doesn't completely deliver the story was rather flat and clichÃ© br br 7 10
<START> things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later but is woefully naive in it's utopian ideals br br raymond massey cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson make up a fine cast although the drama is played more as a stage piece than a work of cinema there are grandiose if somewhat stilted speeches often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater however there are some profound words there is technology the savior of mankind or the instrument of its destruction the film is a visual feast if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects sure hollywood is more sophisticated today but rarely as inventive for the imaginative the third act is a treat a world with underground cities massive deco bombers space cannons gyro copters and secret organizations of scientist saviors it has all of the makings of a sci fi pulp adventure but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise br br things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema they are operatic in scope and visually inspiring technology has long left them behind but their ideas still burst forth there is an artistry there one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass produced cinema of today these films are the products of artisans not industrialists
<START> released in 1965 but clearly shot years earlier this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front as usual for grindhouse flicks of era there's a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music annoying narration and awkward editing the coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines all we get are reaction shots to the off screen character's voice 50s pretty misty ayers strips to her french cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started she's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother does the dishes mixed randomly to produce among other things the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film watch as he taps it watch as he strikes the match will he inhale or will he be captured by apaches only time will tell the film tells the sordid tale of how sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse falls for a dope and can't escape for some reason we're treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientÃ¨le some stupendously lame comedy boozy dame accidentally drinks milk har dee har and silent film acting doesn't help this is one of the worst feature films i've ever seen even on the something weird video marquee it's really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema very bad cinema
<START> well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i don't know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she's still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i can't agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut ' at least something happens in this one
<START> an unusually straight faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax 2 or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker 2 chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low budget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actually's interested in the material i e don't bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title actors who've had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in years as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit one note it's clear his character is supposed to be self destructing throughout the film but grieco doesn't quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre 2 dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormon like cinema this one's more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan b pictures of the 70's giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a well written character driven above average straight to video actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night this low budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks but that's another story
<START> it is a story of siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties it is about passion and feelings about russian soul and very romantic this movie is not action packed it flowes slowely in second part one can find great songs russian romances it is much more better than doctor zhivago the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example
<START> a bondage humiliation s m show and not much else the plot is flat really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set pieces the host of the aforementioned show a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing the dream like ending felt tacked on to the film's credit though aya sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities kubrick's is easily the more layered artistic and atmospheric picture
<START> serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction known as chapter plays they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called chapters or episodes each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week the serial would end with a cliffhanger as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape br br the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again serials were especially popular with children and for many children in the first half of the 20th century a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial along with animated cartoons newsreels and two feature films br br the golden age for serials was 1936 1945 this was one of the best of the era br br zorro has been seen in many films but reed hadley racket squad the undying brain was excellent in the role br br the action is constant and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer br br zorro triumphs as he always does
<START> as a guy who has seen all the seasons i can say that jg constantly surprises me i mean after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster u thought to yourself ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster's skin but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life i mean i could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro marlon brando and al pacino these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more but nowadays they are either old or dead brando and it's ok that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be i can't wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
<START> this is one of the funnier films i've seen it had it's crude moments but they were full of charm it's altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell's nipple i truly was surprisingly this is a good natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carell's friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended
<START> aardman does it again next to pixar aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly br br i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts i thought it translated well for american audiences my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show br br having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this the animators did a great job matching up pre recorded voices to a perfect match animal look at the first episode with the goat who sounds stoned and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other dawg br br is this for everyone not by a long shot in fact i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season but like i said before audiences aren't going to get it
<START> the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant i love it all the story lines are so good and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other their problems were real and it really drew you into the show the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives the family consisted of abby day mum jack day dad natalie day sporty daughter cooper day outsider son and nathan day boy genius son each episodes a day of their life with coopers perspective on things throughout it i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great he was by far my favorite character it ended with so many things it could've continued with i'm really sad another season wasn't made it was a great show i'm gonna miss it
<START> i caught this movie about 8 years ago and have never had it of my mind surely someone out there will release it on video or hey why not dvd the ford coupe is the star if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away
<START> josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there emil jannings won a well deserved oscar in part for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind the scenes tinseltown in the early days von sternberg delivers yet another classic and one that is filled with the great elements of romance intrigue and tragedy
<START> at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead' now given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you br br in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off except we're back in the original 1950s living dead era stereotypical middle american small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well adjusted useful members of the community this so we're informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br the beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual br br it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all round strong cast it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like br br so in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you
