<START> if you've ever seen this movie you'd know that it if you haven't and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if you're really bored go rent it if you want to know what it's like here's my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is
<START> just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action br br but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it rating 3 10 br br derboiler
<START> it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction
<START> i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchable br br supposedly the performances on the shield are great br br in reality the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact br br i don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional impact br br i'll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but that's pretty much all i can give it br br it's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed
<START> don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it br br i saw this movie with my two kids 5 7 they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast to tell the truth i was bored silly it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn't work my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kids thought the character animation looked weird i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmares br br trust me i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything but quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little
<START> this anime is a must see for fans of evangelion it's an earlier work of anno hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place also those who didn't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to sci fi anime in that it's actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around
<START> to die for 1989 was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century br br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they're so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting br br not recommended by me because i didn't like it br br 'nuff said
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies ever made bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad everything in the last 15 minutes a cat suited cyborg is introduced which muddles everything malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill i just don t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning i could have done better special effects in my bathtub there's no continuity the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad acting do they have to smoke to be bad the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets make up your mind the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing whay is it called 2013 seadly wake it has nothing to do with the movie
<START> it was the night he came home warned the posters for john carpenter's career making horror classic set in a small american town halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael this plot out line inspired countless horror knock offs throughout the 80s 90s and continues to do so today as well as a poorly received 2007 remake the difference between them and this is quite simply that halloween is the best br br made on a very modest tight budget halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub genre of sexually promiscuous teens getting stalked by a knife axe chainsaw wielding psycho
<START> hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i haven't seen it in a few years could any one please tell me when it will come on again i would really appreciate it alot you can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me know i would really appreciate it alot br br
<START> tillman jr 's drama about the first african american navy master diver gooding jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works taxi driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances imdb rating 6 6 my rating 9 10
<START> i like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story this doesn't occur in this movie it's a series of vignettes with no cohesion br br there are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans a woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses this woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why she disappears completely after about 30 minutes there is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment there are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the mamas papas 'california dreaming' is vastly overplayed i used to like the song the dialogue is mostly concerned with food pineapples chef's salad and ordering drinksÂ i assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed br br there is no passion in this movie because there is no story this is purportedly a romance it is no such thing i just wonder why i didn't hit the fast forward i kept waiting for something significant to happen Â it doesn't maybe that's the only consolation to this movie scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense
<START> dr hackenstein begins at the turn of last century '1909 the dawn of modern medical science' to be exact dr eliot hackenstein david muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments dr hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life it's now 'three years later' dean slesinger micheal ensign is round the doc's house for dinner as dean slesinger dr hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstien's experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to dr hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate 'accident' can telepathically talk to him christy botkin provides sheila's voice apparently dr hackenstein also show's dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life the dean has some sort of seizure apparently dies meanwhile sisters wendy bambi darro as dyanne dirossario leslie trilling catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john alexis their cousin melanie victor stacey travis are driving along near hackenstein's house when they crash they seek shelter assistance arrive upon hackenstein's doorstep dr hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night later on dr hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers xavier logan ramsey ruby rhodes ann ramsey who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila dr hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available starts to 'borrow' the bits 'n' pieces he needs to complete sheila br br written directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr hackenstein i'll state right now that it ain't brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it's middle as things settle down the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson catherine cahn by kicking out hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolanda's back who is seemingly oblivious to what's happening with a touch of gore but i'd say dr hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception feel throughout there are some tacky puns sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh dr hackenstein to wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example i also thought the scene when mrs trilling phyllis diller reports her missing daughter's to the bemused detective olin william schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle's talking about why he isn't looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesn't have a prisoner in it that if he didn't find the cousin not to worry about it none of it's flat laugh out loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion found the film as whole to be quietly amusing there isn't a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs sheila's decapitated head some medical stitching those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way i liked the characters in dr hackenstein too which was surprise in itself the acting isn't brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements some serious overacting means it's never dull oh the three birds in dr hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean technically the film is ok as well once again it ain't going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting it doesn't always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room stick a few candles in there it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn't a bad looking film at all considering could have done without the comedy music though overall i ended up enjoying dr hackenstein much more than i thought i would although that in itself isn't a recommendation it's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made it certainly is not the worst either a watchable enough piece of harmless fun
<START> i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it i'd put it in my queue on the basis of heather graham and her strong cred as an actress imho while parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable not to mention the ick factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple i don't care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross and charlie for a zoologist she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other homo sapiens what was it about her besides her hotness and some common interests that made gray fall for her the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth high points molly shannon although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion the cabbie in drag and the dance sequences if sam gray were such great dancers i wish we'd seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie could have been better
<START> when i was a little girl and my dad owned a video store this was among my favorite movies i hadn't heard much about it since then nor did i really remember anything about it it having been forgotten in the wake of don bluth's other probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago however and was pleasantly surprised again set in new orleans in the 1930s the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough but they generally don't detract from the storyline which leaves you smiling and maybe even a little misty eyed if you are a lover of animals the characters are believable maybe even a little too grown up for younger watchers as well two paws up and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while definitely worth a re watch
<START> having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script and in some cases don't seem to care br br well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release it is good the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ok he's not oscar material yet but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie br br ultimately just give it a go you won't be disappointed you won't be bored in fact i think you'll be more than happy with the end result
<START> bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power singing the good old perennial ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
<START> i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good i was watching the movie with high expectations though i knew it was a flop especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re kindle the past backfired royally sholay the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all star cast cult dialogue stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average prashant raj a newcomer doesn't know what acting is nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay
<START> the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawd br br to me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film as art yes it's beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease it's hot it has drama it's audacious precisely what this film is not
<START> soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere br br one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic br br i'll give this one 3 out of 5
