<START> this is not the video nastie but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is 75 a rehash of the boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was br br i was initially confused as i thought that annie kelly galindo may have been a different lacey but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same person br br after seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well annie her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials head to the house and sure enough it's the same bathroom 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described of course we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered br br then the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original sadly some of the good scenes were cut but 90 of it is there why rerun this film did they find the footage in the trash what was the purpose br br we'll never know and despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured we all know the bogeyman will never die
<START> when i first watched this we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times we've just watched it again and i liked it more than i did the last time i'd watched it br br the film is mainly about two dogs called charlie and itchy voiced by dom deluise and i love dom deluise charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie which i like itchy is his sidekick charlie is killed by his friend not and sent to heaven when charlie comes back to life it is the start of an amazing adventure br br the five main reasons why i'm absolutely crazy about this film one i love the characters except carface my favourite three are charlie itchy and a little girl called anne marie who comes slightly later two i love the period of history in which this film is set it is set during the prohibition in the united states three the don bluth animation as usual is superb the backgrounds are good too four there is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat five the songs in this are lovely my favourite song starts with i need brazil the throb the thrill br br so watch this lovely film when you can you won't be disappointed
<START> starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way this film is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released i have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular in fact they are my favourites but when they are done this bad it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time the story is as clichÃ©d and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie ghost guy its not the story that sucks the most its the atrocious acting and dialouge home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night what the hell was the director thinking with this move what he had only one day to film all this in he was scared of the dark is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black though br br i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed im sure one of the teens plays bingo down the local pub but she's 40 45 br br anyway good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time
<START> when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super
<START> to overcome the death of his wife an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do at least in a peter greenaway movie he and his son populate their home with eight and a half one has no legs women and embark on a sexual odyssey this being a greenaway film there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity in fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude gross besides who wants to see an old guy full frontal for those who are not into the homo erotic scene one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses there is no story just a random collection of dull scenes
<START> i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club it was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helms burton but then the film started and the cinema's peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on screen br br the storyline of nada mas promises much carla is a bored envelope stamper at a cuban post office her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them transforming basic interpersonal grunts into brontÃ«an outbursts of breathless emotion cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy grief pity terror and the like br br the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film school artiness latino caricature marx brothers slapstick and even during a particularly underwhelming editing trick the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character's face br br unidimensional characters abound cunda the boss at the post office is a humourless dominatrix nosferatu her boss eyed accomplice concha variously points fingers eavesdrops and screeches cesar the metalhead dolt and romantic interest reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami a chase scene in oh so hilarious fast forward is thrown in for good measure all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip but in a black and white zero fx flick with highbrow pretensions ahem br br nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the 'quirky heroine matchmakes strangers' of amelie and the 'poetry as great redeemer' theme of il postino like amelie its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers and like il postino the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead unfortunately nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film br br there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late night tv stupor the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checker tiled floor which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack this film should not have merited a global release films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully
<START> this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen i'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog so the language barrier wasn't an issue i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie there is only one professional actor in the cast and i'm guessing no professional directors or writers br br although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating this is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7 3 to something more realistic perhaps 4 3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back br br the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give lost in translation a 10 as well
<START> this is the columbo that got directed by steven spielberg at an early point in his career it's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for spielberg can be seen in this movie the movie is basically in the same style as most of spierlberg's '70's movies and tv works so that means that some characters tend to show some quirkiness's and no i'm not just talking about the columbo character alone the kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 spielberg movie jaws but other than some small hints of typical early spielberg elements you can't call this movie the work of and fine example of a rising director star not that its bad of course it isn't but as i said earlier it also isn't anything too sensational br br this movie began really well and very promising but after it's fine opening in which as always the murder occurred the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch dull because it's mostly a columbo movie by the book that doesn't have real memorable moments in it not dull because it's a boring movie to watch br br the murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential the story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities at least that's the feeling this movie left me with br br the movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of jack cassidy who thinks he's smarter then columbo due to his mystery crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints leading away from himself but of course columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along br br the movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with spielberg's later work especially some of the camera angles br br a fine and perfectly watchable columbo movie but don't let the name of spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highly br br 7 10
<START> i should have known when i looked at the box in the video store and saw lisa raye to me she's the female ernie hudson a k a le kiss of death for any movie its almost guaranteed the movie will be bad e g congo if hudson is in it with the exception of the ghostbusters films which were intentionally campy and bad despite my instincts and the fact that i just saw civil brand yet another cinematic tour de force starring lisa raye i rented it anyway after all i ignored my hudson instinct on oz and ended up watching a very quality series so i figured i'd give this movie a chance br br if you are a lover of bad movies this is a definite must see this has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie i've seen in a loooong time the plot is fairly straightforward racheal's monica calhoun sister is killed by a band of brigands led by bobby brown and like many an action movie before this she straps on her guns one last time and vows to avenge her sisters death to do this she reassembles the titular gang of roses supposedly based on a true story of a female gang and they go out and exact revenge and along the way there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town one nice thing i will say about this movie is that from what i could tell the stars did their own riding and they looked great galloping br br the funniest albiet unintentionally funny scenes look for when they introduce stacy dash's character or when calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens or lil' kim's character joking with lisa raye's character or stacy dash's character being killed or lil' kim's character convincing lisa raye's character to rejoin the gang or the asian chick or macy grey's character talking bout the debt is paid etc with the exception of calhoun's racheal and bobby brown's left eye i can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz i was laughing so hard when they were introduced br br if the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie unfortunately he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition sound design in his defense hip hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece set design script writing nor period historical research was it me or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west seriously usually when i see a movie that's not so good i ask myself could you have done any better this is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal yes
<START> anthony mcgarten has adapted his play via satellite and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time chrissy dunn danielle cormack is a drop out she hasn't achieved much in her latter years and has grown resentful of her family since her father's deathbed confession her twin sister carol also portrayed by danielle cormack is basking in the media limelight as she represents new zealand in swimming at the olympics a middle aged desireless and desperate director brian sergent and his good natured cameraman who is also chrissy's one night stand from the night previous paul karl urban film the dunn family's proudest moment watching carol swim to victory this wouldn't be so bad but chrissy's family is the epitome of embarrassing first of all there is the matriach of the wellingtonian dunns joyce donna akerston she makes fairy cakes and cocktail sausages for the all important film crew and refuses to change the way she is her oldest daughter jen rima te wiata is desperate to be something more than common she has a nice home with bedroom walls painted blackberry sorbet expensive tastes and a nasty parasitic attitude to match she is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child her husband ken tim balme is an electrician and forces himself on jobs that don't need doing as well as doing jobs that need to be done ie jen the middle daughter lyn jodie dorday who won best supporting actress at new zealand film awards for this portrayal is a knocked up tart who has a dubious history with ken both older sisters clash the mother is in a state ken is as bad a tooltime tim taylor carol is fuelling her olympic desire and chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv why shouldn't she be embarrassed it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare i loved the sparring between jen and lyn one is like an adult mona my biological clock is ticking away the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires a bun in the oven climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done the performances are a treat and the film works perfectly a great way to spend an hour and a half br br
<START> this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played it's not the average shoot everything that moves kind of fps which i usually don't care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere i'm a great horror fan escpecially of clive barker's stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 9 10 1 because i'm no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
<START> joan fontaine is a damsel in distress in this 1937 musical starring fred astaire george burns and gracie allen the plot what there is of it is about a british woman fontaine in love with an american who is mistaken for astaire a musical comedy star br br the film directed by george stevens contains some wonderful gershwin music including nice work if you can get it and a foggy day the best scene is the stiff upper lip number which takes place in a fun house br br astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers burns plays his over the top publicist and allen is burns' secretary she's hilarious the problem as others have pointed out is fontaine who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot and it takes place among the trees i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy br br definitely worth seeing despite its flaws
<START> ok so i don't watch too many horror movies and the reason is films like 'dark remains' i caught this on a surprisingly feature filled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants br br however the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised i'd only really seen about 10 of it the rest of the time i'd been watching the pizza on my coffee table nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up again br br the film making is solid and the characters' situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button it's merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi million dollar production the make up effects really looked like it was also it's obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film making the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed on line that this film won the la shriekfest a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers' clear talent and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed to br br turn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend order a pizza
<START> this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling br br the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none also no real suspense br br washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast br br the story simply falls a little flat even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact you don't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare br br there is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships carter but this seems forced br br it's an ok film but instantly forgettable
<START> mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of french society in a life without meaning purpose or direction br br i watched this because of all the stellar reviews but i'm afraid i must have missed something the character of mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life she's not interesting or exciting she's just useless br br i've seen and known enough people like that there is no secret meaning to what they're doing they are just lazy bums i wouldn't want mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch sure she's enigmatic because there isn't anything to her lots of junkies winos and bums i've seen are enigmatic i wouldn't want to see a film about them either br br possibly there is something there that i totally missed otherwise i'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art
<START> while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie i suppose i'll just number a few of them br br 1 the acting Â when you see that edward albert doug mcclure and susan george and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know you're in trouble not that it matters much to me but these are hardly a list names susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen and in this movie her acting is embarrassing as for the other two the less said the better br br 2 the ghosts Â the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disney world and they are about as frightening and why did they have to be so obvious subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells br br 3 the plot Â how predictable can one movie be the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes you need to see more movies br br 4 the convenient priest Â what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits absurd is a word that comes to mind br br 5 everything else Â it's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture that's a sure sign of a winner Â noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie br br i'll stop you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned and i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems be warned this thing is horrible
<START> hoo boy this was a real trial to get through the dvd case has tom hanks' mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it he looks about forty on the box however the movie was made in 1982 so he still has his bosom buddies 'do and of course is about forty pounds lighter the plot concerns a dungeons and dragons like game that hanks and his three friends play and hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real chris makepeace is a boy genius named jay jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats ooh look he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo now he's dressed like a wwi pilot this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way a bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids there's anne i'm honey west dammit francis and louise sorel who actually looks kind of hot murray hamilton the mayor from jaws has a thankless roll as a cop wendy crewson is the love interest for hanks and some blonde guy i have never seen before or since there is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement there is a monster that only hanks can see because he's you know nuts the monster is played by the late great kevin peter hall he of predator fame a friend of mine got this out of the ol' discount bin at mallwart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it so naturally i had to see if it was as bad as all that it was the night before i watched apollo 13 so after that this movie was a bit of a shock do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin oh yeah after hanks almost jumps from one of the world trade center towers because of his delusions he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends hanks mother a drunken vera miles says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit he is crazier than ever the end
<START> this has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger 57 but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way just a few of the awful moments in the movie a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience when on the runway perfectly straight of course she is instructed to pull on the flaps huh come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary this is a movie you want to miss take my word for it
<START> poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now it's europa 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment br br nor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her long suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli br br bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman she's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is going br br bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post war rome but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse br br the film's overall effect is that it's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she's two timing him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum br br ingrid suffers nobly through it all over compensating for the loss of her son but it's no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildly br br trivia note if she wanted neo realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak it would have done more for her career than europa 51 br br summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman
<START> im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you this movie is awesome from beginning to end it is filled with genuine thrills the fight scenes are fantastic the chase scenes are enthralling and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained but that is only because everything that preceded it damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor daring you not to believe him in this role he is this role a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain hope i spelled that close to right as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous thus negating a 10 rating the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these for none have been bad excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy br br p s the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action but i still think we could do without it the good news is you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action
