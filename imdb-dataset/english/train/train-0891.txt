<START> as a child i always hated being forced to sit through musicals i never understood why people would break out into song like that and i was far too young to appreciate the artistry choreography set design costumes pacing behind it all carol reed's oliver was the one musical i remember oddly enjoying as a child probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of dickensian squalor this is a musical about ghetto life in victorian london and while the scenery and set designs are stark dark and true to that way of life it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery upon a recent viewing my first since childhood i have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical works in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way and why most just don't do it for me br br when musicals work or really say something it is because they realize their own inherent strangeness lars von trier's dancer in the dark as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist an immigrant obsessed with hollywood musicals likewise the very cynical and enjoyable chicago worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal ingenue singer dancer musicals don't work when they take their own musical nature too seriously like in moulin rouge or are simply too much fluff about nothing i e something pointless like mary poppins upon viewing oliver for the first time as an adult i saw it in a new light told mostly from the point of view young oliver i saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him the best musical number was probably when nancy got everyone in the tavern signing and dancing about the joys of getting drunk as a cover to help poor oliver escape the clutches of the evil bill sykes it was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano there are other great and classic tunes to be heard here and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notch br br still for all its bleakness although it does have a happy ending for oliver at least though certainly things didn't end happily for nancy and unless you think a life on the streets being a pick pocket is fun it wasn't a necessarily a good ending for fagin or the dodger despite their peppy closing tune i wouldn't really classify this as a family film though i don't think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm this is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how perhaps a revisionist take on it where people on the streets of compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives i'd like to see a hard edged hip hop version of oliver i always thought dickens would translate well in those regards as it stands oliver was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest g rated film i've ever seen
<START> with the mixed reviews this got i wasn't expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised it's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing that's breezy without being glib and a good pace it looks good too in a funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and i'm one who liked it
<START> quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well what is it what is it about will smith that i just can't stand any longer i guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an oscar i understand how bias this is but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons i can't ever see him winning one he's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor he's just not i give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry at the drop of a hat that's about it br br seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me right from the start the suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me in any way i wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide there were absolutely no surprises the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry also i don't know her name but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife woody harrelson had very limited screen time but i'd say he stole the show whenever he was on br br all in all just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot i couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people never once felt sorry for 'tim ben' he killed himself with a jellyfish was the only survivor in an 8 person accident geewiz didn't see any of that coming br br 5 10 is pretty generous
<START> the same night that i watched this i also watched scary movie 4 making for one messed up double feature unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid brutally dated and brutally bad the more recent parody had me laughing out loud how could i desire any more than that director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day the script reeks of stoner humor and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea i sober was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato and that one joke that is never funny where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here some may giggle i did not they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny and i thought all hitler jokes were funny br br the narrative of this film is so splintered for no good reason that it is nearly impossible to explain tomatoes kill people the government tries to stop it bad jokes are told their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media consumerism and paranoia three things that still control our lives today oddly enough the main selling point of this film those gosh darn tomatoes really don't make much of an appearance and when they do get this they're played by real tomatoes that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun br br i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here man eats tomato and that's dinner tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe but that is just the way the world works in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification but in the real world our produce see taco bell becomes evil thanks to neglect and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago there are a few good chuckles to be had the last shot was really quite splendid but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there and by there i mean to the level of scary movie 4 1 4
<START> no fireworks despite violent action br br science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts woefully so in the case of the latter with essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and in particular special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first timer paolo mazzucato whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus br br
<START> a prequel to the re imagined battlestar galactica series from the same creative team ronald d moore and david eick as well as new series co creator remi aubuchon caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race br br the pilot and the series are set to follow two families the graystone's which include daniel eric stoltz a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe alessandra toreson while the adama's include joseph esai morales a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica br br like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz br br for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel this is achieved through some of the architecture the costumes and the way it is shot br br while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar religion is again very important here while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one as well as issues related to crime and government br br the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv the series is set to start in 2010 br br like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver
<START> upon the straight story release in 1999 it was praised for being david lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere '66 mower at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch's trademark motifs coming through br br lynch's focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced br br the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic com focused on this very criticism that it wasn't a typical lynch film lynch is struggling within the mold of a g rated story that isn't his own brundage claims with his protagonist alvin straight quoting lines directly from confucious he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead lost highway or mulholland drive all films which i also adore the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible if you are a lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature br br the narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti makes me yearn to go to america the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win regardless however it is probably the finest swan song for any actor br br so whilst the straight story features none of lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended
<START> i went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film i was still bitterly disappointed i actually cant believe i spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film it was that bad the storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible even though it had big names such as uma thurman in it this film heavily relied on its special effects but they personally had no effect on me i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards my advice is to save your money go shopping treat yourself just don't go and see this film you'll live to regret it lol
<START> the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man vs woman argue all the time but wind up in love type of hollywood screwball romance comedy br br i usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing fun to watch and oozes with charm br br jimmy stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple the supporting cast is outstanding from the always likable felix bressart to the villain joseph schildkraut br br frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters i've ever seen him do in his career he takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him that twist is another reason this film rises above others of its kind br br once again when a film has a good mix of categories it usually succeeds this is a great example of that in this movie it's romance comedy and drama and it's well done i'll take this over the re make you've got mail any day no comparison
<START> the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa but it is so much more than that br br anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things a longing for another one of a different race that cannot be consummated even a glance is forbidden there are no words needed their facial expressions say everything br br it is the story of a black servant protÃ©e isaach de bankolÃ© and a white woman aimÃ©e giulia boschi their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other br br the little girl france cÃ©cile ducasse is lonely and spends all her time with protÃ©e she really can't see this dance br br one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves there world is about to end they just don't know it yet their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence br br i think i would like to visit this africa it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals
<START> for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature having healthy respect for pixar i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here the graphics is amazing the background surroundings are mind blowing almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly sometimes i felt tingles down my spine so much i loved what i've seen br br the plot is absolutely romantic as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be the characters are lovable especially hector the blue rabbit he owns pawns rocks and rules the other char s are very nice also the humor is top notch br br generally it seemed that creators didn't invest much effort into this i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great they've made a magnificent touching movie a candy for eye and heart br br the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10 10
<START> no scenario bad actors poor melissa gilbert beurk beurk beurk br br give a such budget to make this in belgium we make ten films which win all prices in cannes with this br br last time that i've seen a such null film was hypercube but scenario was better br br is anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school film or a cop br br the better things in this film was the word end br br why authorize to sell this 1Ã§ is to expensive br br i've pay ten dollars to buy this br br for me pay for this was my big mistake of millennium br br too bad br br next time i'll break my arm but buy this type of sh t
<START> my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage the acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of oklahoma and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane 85 of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them mother f seems to be the writer's favorite because it is used constantly it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward don't waste your time or money with this
<START> after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer 1976 to be the final chapter in the series dirty harry is back older more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic br br dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer vigilante cops and vietnam veteran terrorists but now he's after a new killer a killer who wants payback by gunning down her attackers br br sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman played by sondra locke who was brutally raped along with her sister who is left traumitized ten years after she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack of which the mob are hunting him as well so in order to let the heat die down within the city harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well while hunting her attackers one by one harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar as he homes in on the killer's trails br br sudden impact in my opinion has to be one of my top 10 revenge films as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had a dark tone with entertaining value br br so do you feel lucky punk
<START> i've been using imdb for a few years now but have never written any reviews before however this movie so disappointed me even with a modest score of 6 4 at the time of writing that i couldn't keep quiet anymore br br noise is the story of a new yorker tim robbins who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter ego as a as a vigilante the rectifier and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car alarm sounding br br i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms car alarms car alarms car alarms there is really no other focus when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins' character br br yes we're all annoyed by noise nobody likes the sound of car alarms of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle and this movie uses that fact and pretty much that fact alone to sell this movie i say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship including a completely needless threesome which is obviously thrown in for those movie goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie honestly it's eye rolling br br robbin's character very shortly into the movie becomes completely unrelatable it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry car bashing dude into this hero of the little guy the rectifier however the transformation doesn't take place he just renames himself br br i could go on for a while annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie and the self satisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either br br overall i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be as it's pretty much shoved down your throat but in my opinion it fails in a big way just one guy's opinion cheers
<START> if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over 2 hour movie about the french revolution and also didn't have any sets and had to have my 4 year old autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn't make the auditions of that year's soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didn't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn't stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hell worthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas' latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel space laser battle i don't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it but that's not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace
<START> for anyone with a moderate sensibility a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition for anyone capable of getting above the hollywood ilk for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of seagals willis van dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp sympathise with comprehend laugh with cry with natural tender heart warming hilarious compassionate human beings le huitiÃ¨me jour' is waiting for you jaco van dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece that would have been too simplistic he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling is it a drama is it a comedy no it is the story of georges a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality a sufferer of the downes syndrome it is a story which has you laughing through your tears but this is not one of those classic tear jerkers this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration warmth and even love a successful banking salesman harry bumps into georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas problems and priorities skillfully van dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road this is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other the cuasi surrealist scenes fit in perfectly georges recalls or invents past scenes of his life while either day dreaming or sleeping even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct the only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show rooms however this does not detract from the whole this film is a monument even if your french is not up to much please bear seeing it with sub titles le huitiÃ¨me jour' is worth the trouble as for anything else well just read the following commentaries Â i go along with all of them this film is a joy it is majestic it is unique if you have seen rain man' which i consider an excellent film you must see this one it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous hollywood produced world renowned actors it has pascal duquenne and daniel auteuil Â ten oscars for these two and three more for jaco van dormael who caresÂÂÂÂ yes 11 out of 10 if the imdb rating doesn't break down under the strain br br magnifique chapeau
<START> i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time the movie was boring long long and awful plot the special effects sucks like hell it's like watching a movie back in 1999 it's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time matthew settle's performance was quite bad i saw him in band of brothers playing lt speirs he wasn't that bad in fact not bad at all but in this film his acting wasn't convincing enough it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either plus his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it it surprised me really because he was good in band of brothers br br anyway don't even bother to watch this movie it's a big big big waste of time even if you had to kill an hour or two get something else to do besides watching this movie trust me you'll regret it
<START> typically kids films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13 but then again that's before holes hit the scene sure it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions the acting was decent and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways which holes also has a similar redemptive ending to it the only down side the hokey looking lizards overall however an 8 10
<START> this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it this movie was not just bad as in low budget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and doing it with great success what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie i mean it's definately horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing but what the hell is the second segment it's just annoying the third segment is like watching an artsy student film which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment it's an atrocity that this movie isn't way low on the bottom 100 so get your votes 1 10 in people i know some people gave this good reviews but well they're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you trust me it is impossible to like this movie the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life extending effect it feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed
