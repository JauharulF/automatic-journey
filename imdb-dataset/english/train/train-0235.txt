<START> ernst lubitsch's contribution to the american cinema is enormous his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever as is the case with the shop around the corner this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play without the charm or elegance of mr lubitsch's own and definite version br br margaret sullavan and james stewart worked in several films together their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another but who fate had them working together in the same shop in budapest br br the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture in here we have the wonderful frank morgan playing the owner of the shop also we see joseph schildkraut felix bressart william tracy and charles smith among others doing impressive work in making us believe that yes they are in budapest br br that is why these films will live forever
<START> a mouse in the house is a very classic cartoon by tom jerry faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own it is hysterical hilarious very entertaining and quite amusing artwork is of good quality either br br this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too because Â«there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning and that's the cat that catches the mouseÂ» br br if you ask me there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon the funniest for me are for example when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically Â«i'm glad you're enjoying the siestaÂ» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't making the two cats gasp another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom of course that even funnier than this is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both dumb cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the rear lol naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad she isn't someone to mess with but even jerry doesn't win this time because he is expelled by her too
<START> okay this has been a favourite since i was 14 granted i don't watch it multiple times a year anymore but this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message this movie is fun it's pretty dated almost passe but parker posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable if you want to be charmed by a 90's breakfast at tiffany's attended 90's raves or love parker this movie is for you otherwise don't bother
<START> any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of if not the best of all time it was packed with excitement and surprises one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson the show that michaels put on was unbelievable especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match
<START> the last i believe of the movies the boys made with hal roach this is also the last truly funny film they made before going to 20th century fox which so famously misued their talents although there are weak moments the business with the lung tester for instance is a bit ah overblown but worth having just to see dr jimmy finlayson but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen richard cramer uncredited appeared in other l h flicks and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger the scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal looks good smells good and it probably tastes good eat it is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre stan ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans
<START> closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathan's beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates 'burners' while little bro' lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer br br lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day br br choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting br br sunday august 25 1996 video
<START> larry buchanan yep same guy who did attack of the the eye creatures and two count 'em two conspiracy movies about marilyn monroe he's to blame here br br adding onto his ever growing pile of folders left over from oliver stone's eh i grew out of it conspiracy drawer here's down on us i e beyond the doors which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy br br forget everything you thought you knew about jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison says big lar' cuz this is the real deal y'see the three big names in rock of the '60s were killed by the government because they were subversives or counter productive to truth justice and the american way or sumpthin' like that there i knew it all along br br anyway three people chatman meryl wolf who look eerily like their real life shadows that is if you completely close your eyes turn your backs and walk five miles away from them show that instead of their recorded deaths the good old us of a put hits out on them yep it's the truth br br man i cannot believed i watched this movie it's facts when not stretching credibility to the snapping point are ludicrous the acting makes tv commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end you deserve the twist ending you really really do i swear genius br br but like the man said rock and roll is dead long live rock and roll br br not this flick though br br no stars for down on us and that's the movie audience describing the film by the way
<START> though i'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty the great tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package ching siu tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if i'm not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere an ethereal treasure highly recommended
<START> i heard a few friends one day saying that scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early 80s now i usualy listen to idiots watch cnn so i decided i'd stay away from it then my mate handed me the dvd and said this is 1 with the pelicangs confused i tried it this is the best film ever made it's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford cough2fast2furiouscough there is some humor though i e the pelicangs and the light 80s music still whats better than al pacino wielding an m203 i give this a out of perfect for fans of al or gta vice city
<START> i remember this game it was always sitting on the shelves alone until one day i decided to try something new for a change and got this game i stared in awe at it since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs when i played it i couldn't put the controller down seriously br br the storyline of this game is so good and twisted it's almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline and that is hard to accomplish when you play the game you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a ps1 game as it feels like a movie and i believe it should be made into a movie br br too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves with a 50 off sign sitting on it trying to sell well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good heck that is how i got into final fantasy vii looking in a catalog and finding it but this is different than final fantasy br br legend of dragoon is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games surprisingly i wouldn't be surprised if it was made by square enix but it's not hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series or the dragon quest series but this one is but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised which it should be br br graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game but what can you expect from it it's ps1 man made in 1999 story i have already mentioned is amazing almost beats vii characters are a amazing you get involved so much with them and their actions br br a definite 10 out of 10 definitely deserved more praise and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix
<START> spoilers br br the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi karloff and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland sporatically watchable haunted house spoof lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi br br of course kay kyser and his band of 30 something year old kids uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist
<START> ah channel 5 of local mexican t v everyday at 2 00 a m they air horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it br br the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word br br the movie at some points looks like a soap opera because of it's absurd dialogs cinematography and direction br br my advice is avoid this one at all costs it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre film making br br you have been warned
<START> this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series a short lived japanese tv show that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show this short in the series is like all the other films in the series practically without any story a group of guys have captured a young woman they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her they beat her pour boiling oil over her use pliers on her and finally in loving closeup push a needle through her eye this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies and one of the first it was probably this film more than any of the others that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage's movie 8 mm these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles they have progressed to more polished but equally graphic movies like naked blood they probably fill the void left by the mondo movies that got slightly cleaned up and became reality tv not recommended but will probably allure those who will see anything once and wonder why afterwards i know i did
<START> this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 grand prix not i might add the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win that is how far short this film falls now don't take this the wrong way i love b movies around half my collection is made of b movies but i don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is br br first of the story for a b movie isn't that bad it has potential there to make a b movie brand were not talking friday 13th potential but potential none the less but what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do i believe anything it's like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan br br in summary i'd like to say i've seen worse films but i can't
<START> one of the best records of israel's response to the murder of rabin extremely true and natural it captured the spirit of the nation especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of israel's loss and the feeling that we shall overcome
<START> the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918 the troops pile off the train wearing the uniform in which the french army including the legion marched off to war in 1914 this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working metropolitan french troops were put into horizon blue and colonial troops were put into khaki the claude van damme sp remake at least got the uniforms more or less right really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right
<START> someone actually gave this movie 2 stars there's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary br br this film is well i guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting plot story sets dialogue and sound i wrongly assumed it was about zombies br br watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines br br i'm so taken aback i'm writing this review on my mobile so i don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1 6 to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered br br i worst film i've ever seen and i can say with hand on heart it will never never be topped
<START> i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago it came and went with little fanfare but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage the story while nice is really incidental if you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life i just saw it again tonight here in the states on dvd again i gather it has very limited distribution blockbusters only had one copy of it and i don't recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland br br seen on my tv the photography is not as breathtaking though it is still very beautiful the wildlife footage is still fascinating the story of the relationship between the 10 year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around when you know where it's headed br br still as i said the story is incidental it's a beautiful film to watch and if you like wildlife footage you should find this fascinating
<START> over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous chucks wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm preying on the group in various violent ways br br registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the u k in the 1980s the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term 'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks alt title expecting a sleazy slasher experience and that's what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the film's not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail it's simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but that's about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isn't cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it's a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for 90 000 which would be over double that today the dorm that dripped blood isn't a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces it just cannot compare don't expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films i've seen that would actually be better with a remake and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well br br obligatory horror elements br br subgenre slasher br br violence gore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part but nothing special also they off screened some of the best murders br br sex nudity there's a little unappealing to me nudity but not very much br br cool killer s nah the ending monologue s of the killer made him her pretty uncool br br scares suspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effective br br mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didn't care enough and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face br br br br final verdict 3 75 10 bah humbug br br ap3
<START> this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice over for the first has been removed only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder proving that after all animals are more interesting than people
