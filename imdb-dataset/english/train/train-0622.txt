<START> this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in malta at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger mitchell being mitchell the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst i can't imagine watching it on it's own however
<START> very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love br br fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superb br br cheers boom
<START> good horror movies from france are quite rare and it's fairly easy to see why whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big budgeted remake of another great film classic how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy directors leave the country after just one film haute tension was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a one way ticket to the states to remake the hills have eyes which he did terrifically i may add eric valette's long feature debut malÃ©fique was a very promising and engaging horror picture too and he's already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miike's ghost story hit one missed call so there you have it two very gifted frenchmen that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon malÃ©fique is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start but once the plot properly develops it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters we're inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud the elderly and wise inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess withÂ eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmaster device malÃ©fique is a dark film with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals
<START> i had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was positioned as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of ghost blithe spirit tale this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be br br simon and mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants mark is hiv and he and simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore when mark dies simon who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor not that his behavior before mark's death was much different but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings br br unfortunately simon is such a selfish sob it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it's too late to care mark on the other hand follows in demi moore's footsteps from ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie br br there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the tv show bewitched but that doesn't last long once simon's emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings the finale with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny
<START> this movie is as unique as it is overlooked a different story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind i first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family this film should be available on dvd vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster perry king can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned
<START> the slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends dave jeff and sam devon sawa michael maronna and jason segel respectively who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully this continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie nathan schwartzman figures out what they are up to nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions the only problem is when the trio starts to work on it dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted angela james king unfortunately not a brilliant genre movie schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant king's performance is average i think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look the slackers is reminiscent of american pie with a different direction jokes are as shallow as in american pie but aren't they all used i think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality overall a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting except for schwartzman and subject out of
<START> i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires 10 lines but i just can't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isn't available
<START> drawing restraint 9 dir matthew barney br br how do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film is it when bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo asian ritual maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment or when you're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a philip glass score in any case drawing restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies at 135 minutes it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot i would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of p ss christ but that will be coming up later br br actually the documentary esquire portions were the best parts of it the surface plot is about a whaling ship and then there is a ritual about making whale fat then there are the guests in the form of bjork and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed out head shaving think frat boy pranks nicotine patches and giant furry pita hats then there is mutual evisceration cannibalism and lets not forget the giant turd br br matthew barney has written that this is about the relationship between self imposed resistance and creativity that's almost like saying if you don't get it then you're not creative in your interpretation so sod off because i'm an artist oh wait that's the post modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was post modern but its supposed to be modern art which is about the art itself br br so let's start this whole interpretation bit shall we the following lines are only 3 4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie br br the first half hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp obviously the ramp is symbolic of the need for self elevation to whatever standards you hold dear and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom then on a whaling ship they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale obviously a crude element of foreshadowing br br on the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out the fins portion they replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself when its fat its entertaining but bad for you when it is the spinal column its the important parts of the movie or the backbone so to speak then the giant turd is the bowels of the movie or when the movie is crap br br bjork and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships are put into strange humiliating outfits which aren't even well made or symmetrical one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking so they put patches on his head they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it a crash or intersection if you will this inspires bjork and barney who are different on the outside to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person they intersect oh did i forget to mention that this has been done in a robbie williams video then the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid venn diagram barney made it through 8th grade geometry obviously or maybe at least some social studies br br oh and did i forget bjork's ear gouging i want to kill her score at times it is hypnotic but at others you just want to assassinate her br br art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a self destructive joke when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art dali and bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and or entertaining than this piece of trash un chien andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour br br so can i recommend this only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery br br d
<START> the 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing 'em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or high priced movie stars br br the most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of martin e johnson and his wife osa who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in africa and asia the johnsons' safari films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably wheeler woolsey's so this is africa in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs johnson martini instead of martin e johnson geddit although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time the johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour viewed from our own more enlightened i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the johnsons' documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife br br one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co produced with her husband br br 'congorilla' is probably the best of the johnsons' films the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien br br the best and funniest scene in 'congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women the dance is the black bottom no less the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton the conjoined twins wearing jodhpurs riding boots and a pith helmet osa johnson starts scat singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish it's a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm i guess because it's in their blood or something br br i'll rate 'congorilla' 4 points out of 10 this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade
<START> i find it sad that christians and i am one feel that we must make movies like left behind we have much better stories to tell that don't have to be so preachy i was very disappointed with this film as an aspiring filmmaker who believes in christ i see this film as the perfect example for what i am not going to do with my career in film
<START> the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe br br clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the allied bias turning out to be historical fact the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds br br the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag declaring peace in our time to this day has durable propaganda qualities here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options freedom or slavery in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively
<START> for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself it's part of my family's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen br br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
<START> tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films ive never heard of senso now ossessione a very early film by visconti wow the italian version of the postman always rings twice brilliant beautifully acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara calamai as giovanna and especially massimo girotti as gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star the film is much better than the jack nicholson jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version which i really like with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it
<START> ok clara bow silent film from 1927 it's a spin off of rain with bow playing the half hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid english engineer clive brook bow competes with the local widow arlette marchal for his attentions but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up patricia dupont the predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune bow settles her hash fast br br bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes her opening nude bath her hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with bow and brook doing their own stunts br br note the imdb credit list is wrong the film credits from the dvd i have list patricia dupont as playing mrs haldane not margaret truax as listed on imdb
<START> oh dear what a horrid movie br br the production was so cheap and nasty remember the shot from the natural where the lightning hits the tree leaving a glowing stump that roy hobbs makes a bat from well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house br br i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural or did they just hope that no one who would watch the film would pick it up br br then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck such over acting in the cabin br br a really bad film a really bad film
<START> the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from france to the haj in mecca saudi arabia so that he can fulfill his holy muslim obligation before he dies the father is clearly devoutly religious but the son is unimpressed he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion he'd rather be with his non muslim girlfriend the father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama although it is often rather irksome however like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way for example a woman on a backroad in croatia who upon being asked for directions to belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map in bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in bulgarian there is also occasional humor in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat they are given a goat but unfortunately perhaps fortunately for the viewer it runs away before the father can perform the muslim slaughterman ritual they eventually make it to mecca the muslim equivalent of the vatican but on a much grander scale for westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating the movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way a kind of national geographic with soul
<START> sure if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world she's right at least in her own world br br the producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend puffy oh well do i need to say more i'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple deduction br br the whole movie was fake you may just put a few biggie's mtv video together and call it a movie br br the beautiful angela bassett played biggie's mother the real one in life looks like a dog br br i just wonder why he called himself biggie small big body small dick big mouth small sound big fat small eyes disclaimer i'm a person of color so keep your racist remark to yourself
<START> pushing daisies for sure is one of the best tv shows of its genre in the last 5 years agree you with that or not bryan fuller the creator has an amazing creative mind he's the mind behind other great tv shows as dead like me 2003 wonderfalls 2004 and the other one not as great as these ones but also interesting heroes 2006 it's a mix of the marvelous worlds brian fuller created in previous tv shows mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings something that a fairytale always is so being a kind of fairytale you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told br br a gift always comes with a curse and what is sweet can also be bitter that's so ned lee pace the piemaker is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef he can give life to the dead with just a touch this could be a power that everybody would die or live for if wasn't for another simple and very sad thing he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again the curse of this amazing gift doesn't stops there everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute another specie of that one would die instantly he's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love chuck anna friel if wasn't for another sad fact she was dead he gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does but this love is untouchable the truly kiss of death and that's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts br br when i heard about pushing daisies for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar or maybe some kind of tribute to everything that tim burton has created since pee wee's big adventure 1985 to big fish 2003 and charlie and the cholate factory 2005 the results could not be better the world around the pie hole was magnificent the stories around ned and detective cod chi mcbride to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in tv but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and olive kristin chenoweth in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors not only that you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters even those ones with the most deep dark humors br br forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things the actors here are top of note lee pace is tender soft and contained as the character asks for anna friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as chi mcbride detective emmerson cod swoozie kurtz as lilly charles ellen greene as vivian charles and kristin chenoweth as olive snook swoozie kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing but if the best dialogs are given by swoozie and her character the best funny moments are given by kristin chenoweth seems that she's improvising all the time she's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved also there's the chemistry between actors and their characters that are also amazing br br there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had childhood br br truth be told tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one pushing daisies was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful it's true that tv doesn't respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created except heroes that's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones
<START> if you like films that are totally bizarre then this one is for you abdullah is one mean mother with a passion for strangling people and eating ham you should check this film out just for a laugh it is a low budget sci fi musical comedy cannibalistic classic if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere just for the sake of seeing the aliens which are nothing more than little toy robots but in my opinion are the films highlight i'm the big meat eater pass me
<START> it's one of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years i've seen the premier in tel aviv israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs i've seen the bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble
