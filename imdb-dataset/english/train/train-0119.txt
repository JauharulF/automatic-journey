<START> spoiler warning br br when the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it appear that she's been drinking but right before she is killed tells her sister's business partner teri garr on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in 4 days yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report and the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs huh really bad mistake in this movie which is pretty awful overall br br surprisingly bad considering the great cast some faults the writing isn't very good the music is made for tv bad and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie
<START> were i not with friends and so cheap i would have walked out it failed miserably as satire and didn't even have the redemption of camp
<START> believe me i wanted to like spirit the idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old fashioned hand drawn animation again as if the last pencil animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete had got my blood up but then the insulting flavourless banality i had to endure in the first ten minutes of spirit got my blood up even more br br the character designs are generic the animation partly as a result merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about we know from the prince of egypt and the road to el dorado that there are talented artists at dreamworks and the sophisticated use of cgi is in every single instance ill judged why do they bother there's not a single thing worth looking at in an animated cartoon this is fatal br br but it gets worse br br the horses can't talk but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in bambi which can and it seems that in a way the horses can talk spirit himself delivers the prologue sounding for all the world like a 21st century actor picked out of a shopping mall in california and from then on his laid back decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasn't capable of expressing twice as well that prologue by the way a contains information which spirit we later discover had know way of knowing b expresses ideas which spirit would lack the power to express even if he could talk c includes new age rubbish like this story may not be true but it's what i remember and d will give countless children the production is pitched i presume at six year olds the impression that horses are native to north america which is sort of true in that the common ancestor of domestic horses zebras etc was native to north america but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived and the mustangs of spirit's herd which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass were descended from horses introduced by europeans br br so the prologue rather annoyed me br br as often as spirit talks bryan adams sings sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection and it's not that he sings or even how he sings it's what he sings maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less if possible than spirit's spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune although i was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably didn't if only bryan adams and the guy pretending to be a horse could have shut up for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form mediocre and derivative rather than jaw droppingly bad
<START> i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham bad dialogue worse worst acting lifeless all the way and the cast knew it the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life sparkle and were captivating
<START> i'm a sucker for a good romance but this one doesn't qualify as either good or a romance i had the plot nailed down before the credits were through with such poor dialog plot and character development i suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere i had to rush out and rent serendipity for the third time so i could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth
<START> demons iii the ogre is not related pre sequel are on the demons and the demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic demons iii the ogre is very stupid bored cheap monster i am very confuse about the writer is demons iii the ogre lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored william shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from spider's web or what huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream i am very sorry very very very very boring movie i bought the special dvd box called demons on the 3 different movies called demons iii the ogre the other hell and black demons don't have closed captioned and subtitles is cost 14 99 from best buy store in the city of downey why the lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like halloween iii don't have michael myer monster but the people wear halloween i am very confused i really love the demons and the demons 2 are better the boring stupid demons iii the ogre is not part for the demons and the demons 2 are same demons br br thank you juan antonio de la torre
<START> oh this was a really bad movie the girl who plays jennifer is ok but i think she acts bitchy through the movie not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work ravens house of usher like family curse and being buried alive still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film
<START> sure it may not be a classic but it's one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later maybe it was on cinemax one too many times michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie he can't seem to figure out how to play it but he's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with friends it'll make it even better
<START> the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad my dad actually recorded it off the tv i must have watched is over 20 times before the relatively recent release on dvd br br i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed in the first version which i still have on vhs the mood of the film thanks to the dialogue was actually very dark however the new version featuring van der beek et al is more comic br br to put it another way it's like watching the original us release of akira with that dub before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese br br i'm in no way complaining the story and quality of animation are not detracted from but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film
<START> this movie is incomprehendably bad it begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a t rex that talks to the audience it goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout probably because the film makers couldn't afford live actors i'll spare you the long tiresome relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutes br br one of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print b movies and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it but as it turns out our intervention was not neecessary this film makes fun of itself better than we could br br i thought that ed wood's plan 9 from outer space was the cheesiest movie in existence but leave it to japanamation lego cars sock puppets to outdo him if you see this movie anywhere buy it without hesitation it is very rare and worth many many good laughs
<START> this wilfully bizarre adaptation of borges short story is typical cox his strong visual sense is as usual undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast the film is definitely in the surreal tradition of bunuel's mexican period and looks at times like a poor man's take on lars von trier's elements of crime cox's apparent preference for single takes jump cuts and ambient sound recording all work against the film's effectiveness worth a look but ultimately disappointing
<START> i honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back br br the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better br br then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes br br they talked like regular people br br one drove a car br br some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to dance br br that was it out came the movie i couldn't take it any longer can i sue for a Â½ hour of my life
<START> i rarely comment on films but i've read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want all i can say is it is a terrible film the content is poor and offensive the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this legally today
<START> being s club seven the film already boosts an ecstatic atmosphere but seriously oprah has a point when claiming don't go there girl spice world suddenly doesn't seem to be all that bad i take my money elsewhere
<START> to be a buster keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis most of us first encounter keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production 'the general' 'the navigator' 'sherlock jnr' we recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy and we want to see more of his movies here the heartbreak begins after 'steamboat bill jnr' keaton's brother in law joseph schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put keaton under the control of mgm keaton became just one more actor for hire performing someone else's scripts then his alcoholism got worse after 'steamboat bill jnr' keaton never again made a truly first rate film a couple of sources describe a would be masterpiece comedy that keaton claimed he almost got to make at mgm a parody of 'grand hotel' biographer tom dardis has offered convincing evidence that keaton made up this story br br the heartbreak increases because among the many years of keaton's long steady decline he just occasionally came up with a good film such as his short comedy 'grand slam opera' i continue to search for the lost footage of keaton's dramatic scene with spencer tracy in 'it's a mad mad world' a sequence in which embittered cop tracy telephones an old retired crook keaton and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing smiler grogan's cash that footage is almost certainly gone forever but i keep looking br br 'speak easily' alas is one of keaton's films from the beginning of his decline mgm were trying to build up jimmy durante who coincidentally played smiler grogan three decades later as a new comedy star unfortunately mgm tried to build up durante by teaming him with keaton whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with durante's i'm a fan of both throughout his career durante was a merciless scene stealer commendably he knew that he was being built up at keaton's expense and keaton was the only co star whom durante never attempted to upstage br br keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations in 'speak easily' he plays a didactic and humourless midwestern college professor named post because he's as wooden as one who receives a letter informing him that he's inherited 750 000 which he must travel to new york city to claim does he make a 'phone call to verify this does he even check the postmark no he takes his life's savings out of the bank and rushes to new york as soon as he's gone post's manservant confesses that he wrote the fake letter to jostle professor post out of his rut br br post who thinks he's a 3 4 millionaire crosses paths with jimmy dodge durante who's trying to produce a musical revue but hasn't any money the characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh keaton is playing one of those eggheads like mister logic in 'viz' who intellectualises everything durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang there's a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which durante is trying to talk to keaton about money but instead of coming straight out with it durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like 'kale' 'cartwheels' and so forth while keaton of course has no idea what durante's on about i'll give keaton credit his own dry and dusty prairie voice his flat kansas accent is absolutely perfect for the character he's playing here br br sidney toler looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled on tick by professor post henry armetta whom i've never found funny is even less funny than usual here offering a running gag with a stupid payoff thelma todd impressed me here in a more villainous version of the role she played in 'horse feathers' a much funnier movie edward brophy one of my favourite character actors is wasted br br part of the problem with 'speak easily' is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways keaton's lawyer shows up at durante's theatre with an urgent message for keaton but he isn't there so the lawyer proceeds to divulge keaton's personal business to the first total stranger he meets fire that lawyer buster in another scene professor post the guy who's perceived as bankrolling this musical blunders into the chorus girls' changing room and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves i know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way and i seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either certainly not in response to the 'angel' controlling their show's pursestrings br br spoilers coming about half an hour into the unfunny 'speak easily' the great jimmy durante seats himself at the piano grins into the camera and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune this is the moment when i thought that at long last this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us alas no most annoying of all is the ending of this film which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of 'screen directors playhouse' chaplin had already used it in 'the circus' br br i very nearly wept in anger and sorrow at the wasted opportunities in 'speak easily' mostly out of respect for the work that keaton durante toler brophy and miss todd have done elsewhere i'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 br br
<START> warning spoilers br br this is your typical disney film br br 1 policticly correct what with the foster home that has an even divison of races br br 2 insults the viewers intellect with its simplistic lines br br 3 the boy's slezy father is almost directly taken from the never ending story 2 br br 4 in a world full of crime disase corruption starvation and other proplems that need to be taken care of only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention ughhhh br br 5 did you know that angels don't like swearing where the heck did that come from br br 6 in helping the team the angel cause pain and humilation on the opposing team very angelic indeed br br 7 the team the angels are helping are called can you guess the angels disney at its worst br br 8 just got his training wings brillent line br br my conculsion i did not like it at all
<START> this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawa's works combined with dostoyevski's topics of human psychology o shin sonia marmeladova shakespeare's drama and hans christian andersen's tragic and cheerfulness the screenplay is wondrous the scenes are colour and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind the plot is interesting and unpredictable each of the characters is very well developed and interesting there is also a little action so if you don't like all the sentiments you'd also come to your costs it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa certainly worth seeing
<START> i thought the movie i do they don't was fantastic in the past i've watched rob estes on suddenly susan melrose place and also josie bissett on melrose place and loved seeing them together again in i do they don't they have great chemistry together i guess being married in real life helps that in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball of course they stumble but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about so many people have been talking about this movie all good and the movie left us wanting more this would make a great series appealing to many ages it would be so nice to see a real life down to earth family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today instead of the so called reality tv that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here
<START> love trap is a must see independent film when i sat down to watch the movie i came in with low expectations but left with a blessing the story is poetic substantive and creative the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be the movie displayed what love really is action not emotion i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie the entire presentation surpassed my expectations i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds
<START> even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by now and forever the movie was filmed with paramount studios Â not with shirley's parent company twentieth century fox Â in 1934 before fox producer darryl zanuck had perfected the successful shirley formula cute songs cold hearts for her to melt young couples for her to play cupid to happy endings thus now and forever falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story it is an awkward position for any movie but this impressive talented cast makes it work br br gary cooper and carole lombard star as fun loving irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart when they are suddenly landed with custody of jerry's young daughter penny shirley temple it is toni Â and not penny as many believe Â who persuades jerry to give up his criminal career but jerry flounders at his desk job and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty in a standard shirley device penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon felix evans the victim of one of jerry's cons but her attempt fails for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself and he blackmails jerry into helping him steal jewels the drama gunfight death and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine there is no happy ending no dancing and only one song sequence the cute number the world owes me a living br br but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid now and forever rather it's divergence from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films but beware you should avoid colorized version of this film and see it in black and white if you can the color is bright garish and unrealistic and in many scenes shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde yikes
