<START> putting the ufo thing aside this was the best documentary i've seen factual reporting by neil and buzz a must see the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006 no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes the facts will blow you away and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time ever see a man save his own life bet not neil saves his life when only mili seconds separated him from death amazing to watch it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death from a failing computer 10 stars
<START> i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr's character br br like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed br br but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things that's susan hayward's job here in one of her earliest prominent roles hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son has an affair with another and starts making a play for the third it's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live br br i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays everyone is afraid to tell father what's going on the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman here's where the plot gets a little silly bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business bergman has to be let go she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up br br i'm sorry but i can't believe the kids need a governess now hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back in the normal course of things bergman would have gotten on with her life br br one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have br br it's too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback br br susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons and i'm willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor
<START> scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element all pseudo science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed when he summons his rivals who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him to witness his discovery they propose a 'joint' expedition to africa of course they end up stealing much of dr rukh's original discovery giving him only residual credit in addition to that an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbot costello lawton literally steals dr rukh's young trophy wife drake who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being having grown horns like a deer wasn't going to make dr rukh karloff any friendlier so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr benet lugosi the only one who had helped him finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but to my utmost dissatisfaction sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married acting is mostly fine with karloff lugosi being very good check the hysterical chambermaid scene other characters aren't worth mentioning recommended much like all old universal horrors
<START> if it's action and adventure you want in a movie then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere on the other hand if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out the straight story br br richard farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly alvin straight in this true story of alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke br br farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way the story moves along as slowly as the riding mower but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson alvin's going to offer br br stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy it's the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a 7 10 in my book
<START> i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever it's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg 13 while not being kid appropriate the jokes aren't just low brow or f t jokes they're crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg 13 rating too bad it might have made a bigger splash as an r rated film if the funny was left in overstatement probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of time and i'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at 45 minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding down and boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this quagmire tourist trap of a rental 1 2 star glad i saw it as a freebie would have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe
<START> this is the biggest piece of crap ever it looks like they spent more time effort and money making the dvd cover than they did on the actual movie i really thought the dvd had been switched out with someone's homemade porno until i recognized one of the actors from the cover this movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats the picture is really clear but that along with the very unfortunate lighting cinematography if you can call it that production acting if that is actually what they are doing and script if they had one makes this movie look worse than an old porno at least the old porno has a point this just looks like some peta members got together and decided to make a really disturbing pointless psa about animals rights and feelings this is so not worth the money or the time it has nothing in common with the actual btk serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims the people who made this movie should be glad he's not still free or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad
<START> the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down to earth the romance between two teen age boys on the screen was done in good taste you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart
<START> waldemar daninsky paul naschy travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti which causes him to become a werewolf he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover and is later revived by a female scientist dr ilona ermann who uses him in mind control experiments daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments br br upon hearing of naschy's death from colleague jon kitley i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch in my scramble i found i own not one but three copies of fury of the wolfman the film is of questionable video quality the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times and the american versions have two love scenes removed quite frankly without a remastered uncut copy i wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory br br this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky i suspect this is true but you wouldn't know this from the film itself the plot is confusing at times and there's really no indication that this is a sequel if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box you'll see that i'm not alone in my confusion br br perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through while floating around for years it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a distributor and naschy said in his autobiography that the director zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him those really aren't light accusations and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf br br chances are sooner or later you'll come across a low grade version of fury of the wolfman it appears in a variety of three packs and box sets so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know what really needs to happen is an american uncut version with a decent sound and video mix and the love scenes thrown back in as far as i know this does not exist let us honor paul naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves
<START> does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove i looks like a mid to late 70's ford this movie is my favorite as well as my wife's it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it i would like to restore the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie also the music was awesome and the acting was great where and what is the lady who portrayed john's aunt also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell also what year of mustang did debra w drive in this show it looked like a 60's model thanks
<START> i should say right away that i checked the spoilers box only because i'm giving this comment the amount of thought proportional to what this mess of a movie deserves and don't want to be held responsible for some plot point incidentally slipping out br br this comment will take the form of a tirade for the simple reason that i am still under the influence of this movie having just watched it and the unique effect this has renders one incapable of the sort of forethought and paragraph structure required for coherent reasoned criticism that is not a compliment it isn't the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie the feelings it stirs up combine like some uncomfortable emotional voltron composed of a confusing mix of some form of rage the vague desire to take a shower the rudderless sinking feeling of true betrayal one gets when they realize they have given 109 minutes of their lives into the hands of someone who would not only squander it but do so in such a pompous artless way and i probably wouldn't have done anything super productive with that 109 minutes anyway but even if i'd spent it on something trivial like a power block of masturbation and online poker i would have felt more fulfilled when all was said and done br br the problems with this movie are myriad and in better times i'd articulate exactly what they were in a semi adult fashion but in keeping with what this movie deserves i think i'll most likely stick to the realm of masturbation jokes and cartoon references br br the most irritating and terminal flaw is that while watching this movie one is keenly aware that the makers and participants think they are making a much smarter movie than they are demonstrating the depth of knowledge one could pick up in a one semester survey of western art history at a community college or trade school the art jargon is piled on thick and from all directions with much of it supplied by talk between our hero the tortured detective stan willem dafoe who i will forgive for this movie due to him being willem dafoe and his accented antique dealer buddy blair peter stormare taking a break from playing a sociopath for whom murder comes easy by playing a 2 dimensional plot device in a movie about a sociopath for whom murder comes easy and talk they do in fact we are dropped into this story at a crime scene that may indicate the reemergence of a serial killer stan thinks he killed years earlier so all the back story is established partially through unclear flashback but primarily through stilted conversations between stan and his dealer or stan and his colleague the unforgivably irritating carl scott speedman and although i differentiate the character carl scott speedman from the actor who plays him by using parentheses i must admit that very early on in the film i despised this character so much that i actually found myself sincerely wishing harm on the actor portraying him scott speedman not anything too fancy not death or paralysis necessarily but maybe herpes or maybe a stage light could fall on him and crush his arm this is a dangerous digression but i'm not editing it out because i want to leave anyone reading this who's thinking about paying to see this train wreck of a movie with a clear impression of the horrible wishes and feelings it stirs in even the most peaceful man br br well i'm sort of running out of steam here over the course of writing this the sick feelings this movie brought up in a me have subsided my head has cleared a bit realizing now that i'm still investing time in something related to this piece of sh t is startlingly similar to waking up after a night of suicidally heavy drinking next to the heaving form of a still slumbering 200 pound college girl your first urge is a desperate desire to flee this is natural
<START> wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 5 while remaining better than anything else on television but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons br br 6b started with such a sombre mood and janice's always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing tony's penchant for sitting and staring anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil's wave bye bye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into chase's dark humour br br i could go on and on but i'll just add that i thought the final show starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow you keep me hangin' on to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj's suv or phil's head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever br br pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jack off fantasies aj derides and then into which he promptly subsides a tip of the pork pie to mr chase
<START> to say that thunderbirds is a horrid forced in your face ugly looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn't be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why you'd watch this film 1 you've seen thunderbirds when you were young like i did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up or 2 you're seeing it with someone under ten years old br br thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it from the off thunderbirds is wrong wrong wrong the whole moral message and 'goal' is set up in an excruciating way jeff tracy a new low for bill paxton tells his youngest son alan he's not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island's bowels to fire up thunderbird one the whole film is then a series of events and miss fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five br br the film relies on kid actors to carry the film a 16 year old alan tracy corbet a 16 year old tin tin hudgens and a 14 year old fermat fulton who is brains' son to say that watching the 'adventures' they get up to is painful is an understatement frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil 'hood' kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film it only differs when everyone's in a different location also the whole 'mind control' thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood Â forced and incidental br br i know that most 'film's for kids' these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it's done in a way that fetishises lady penelope sophia myles plays penelope and i think it's no coincidence she's a little older than the rest of the kids Â at 24 years old it's almost too good to be true her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push we see her in the bath bubbles up to her neck watching tv in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet bare and bubble covered foot frequent shots of her massive bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman twinned with this her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh dominant english accent sounding like a commanding mistress well she is lady penelope after all Â and you'd better make sure call her that the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won't notice but it sure as hell is there br br the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre the characters that are his bodyguards a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot are we supposed to be laughing at this what about the fight scenes poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises it's utterly utterly laughable br br the list goes on the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place news bulletin sponsored by ford the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip Â it's infuriating the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing thames against the current rescue a downed monorail monorail over the thames get back to the hatch and thus save the day all the time holding her breath it is absolute bull and the makers know it Â i don't even know if a 10 year old would swallow it br br in short avoid avoid avoid thunderbirds is infuriating unfunny poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car Â everything that could go wrong did go wrong
<START> ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective i think it's a shame it only scored 5 2 in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one liners fine acting although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs
<START> personally i disdain the jerry springer show however i found ringmaster to be the funniest movie i've seen this year the never ending satire of jerry springer guests starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value
<START> one of my favorite films for a number of years was last action hero unfortunately arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in br br the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last hero so i was pleased to find it on dvd so i could watch these themes played out so well br br despite the plot within the plot involving white slavery during an african nation's civil war this is not an action movie the plot that the plot within a plot is within is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader or is he actually a fictional character which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional adventure story universe that's actually a rich theme the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film's amiable and campy sense of humor br br there are weaknesses to the film primarily it's cinematography which makes the film look like a tv show and the pacing does sag on occasion br br but i really like these characters and i enjoy the adventure they live however silly and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel br br holds up under multiple viewings m good show
<START> the acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well done brad pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious austrian climber quite well other acting is fine the story could have been riveting but somehow it misses one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience br br beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in but i could not try as i might involve myself in this story as an unabashed brad pitt fan i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation i expected to love this flick and yet it left me cold br br it could be a failing within myself but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie direction scriptwriting production editing somehow they lost me it's a shame because it could have been wonderful br br good acting dramatic story beautifully shot it should have been magnificent it wasn't probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was mostly it bored me
<START> of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already 'raja babu' is one of my most favorite characters i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 7 servant on his motorcycle watch movies and emulate characters etc etc i love the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babu's affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing 'dharam veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks thats my favorite scene of the film 'achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs its brilliant it's a cat mouse film just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other its total entertainment if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan 'deewana mastana' 'ankhein' 'shola or shabnam' 'swarg' coolie no 1' precedes this gem of a film 7 10
<START> i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it my mom likes violent movies so why did she see it she rated it just to bring down the rating so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating i give it a 6 10
<START> jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned please read the book as is it a great source of information i enjoyed it a lot this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities
<START> sitting typingÂ nothing is the latest what if fest offered by vincenzio natali and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers one is having relationship problems got canned from his job because of relationship problems and the police are out to get him because of his job and his relationship problems the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesn't buy cookies from him oh yeah the police are after him too after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him br br man what a day br br what if you could make all of this disappear that is the whole premise behind 'nothing' the two fools realize the cops the girl scout the cars the lawn the road everythingÂ disappear there's nothing but white space this is an interesting concept i thought i also looked at the time of this 30 minutes had gone in the movie and i still had an hour left in the movie could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes although the actors try 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie but the two actors whom are life long friends with each other and the director have such great repertoire with each other that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do there are lots of supernatural elements but it's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing
