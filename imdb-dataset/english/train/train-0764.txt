<START> i had to stop watching this film a pseudo intellectual product for pretentious film viewers twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns not to mention that i was soon near tears over the 3 99 i had wasted at blockbuster joanna pacula's acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents while we're on the topic of talent breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe she clearly has not learned her craft in fact she's really quite awful all the public scenes looked staged with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on don't rent this terrible movie you will be sorry you spent your money
<START> i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts i must admit i found it pretty decent until i started to think about what the characters were saying logical problems br br 1 her boyfriend who seems to be a pretty fit dude makes no sound while being killed don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer br br 2 when the remark is made that the gym teacher is soooo in love with lisa i almost screamed at the screen when your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart br br 3 as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get donna boyfriend aunt and uncle into a car and drive far far away then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get out br br i could go on and on and on basically the plot was decent the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors br br however br br this movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night out if you don't consider all the goofs it's a mediocre film
<START> julia kristina copeland travels with her husband steven harris steven man and their baby son alex to spend a couple of days with her family in savage island an island of their own the couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island while waiting for the boat julia and steven meet two weird men in the harbor and when her brother peter brendan beiser arrives he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island the reckless peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off however he accidentally runs over the young son of the savage's family but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal later the savage family claims alex as a compensation for their lost son the young family does not accept the trade and they initiate a deadly war between families br br savage island is a very low budget movie with a stupid screenplay amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting the flawed story is totally absurd and there are many unbelievable situations for example how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family the logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue peter then the young family vanishes julia and steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends and nobody chases them peter calls his sister julia of alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning there are so many flaws in this flick that i could spend many lines writing about this subject i believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are the good cast deserved a better material to work my vote is four br br title brazil ilha de sangue island of blood
<START> my thoughts on the movie 9 br br it was not good not good at all visually it was great i was pleased with the pacing the camera angles etc however the characters eh kinda bland plot it sucked br br this movie seemed more new age crap than anything else organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful science isn't portrayed any better it creates a monster weapon that kills everything but souls have the power to destroy monsters and bring life really br br that's something that bites my ass a bit too here we have a cgi movie created with science and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us at least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask br br okay so now what or something similar i couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit it was a okay it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible type of exit br br this is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily any thought as to what's the point of that will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing br br okay spoilers follow br br so basically a scientist creates the machine that is capable of creating other intelligent robotic life evil humans use it as a weapon however the scientist realizes that he is also at fault he gave the machine his intellect but didn't give it his heart br br the machine goes skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth finally slowly powering down however the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock puppets each one containing a piece of the scientist's soul br br the last one 9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world he sees a strange device nearby and picks it up he meets up with another like himself 2 br br well 2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the machine 9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue 2 br br they succeed br br 9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly he inserts it and the machine comes back to life pulling out 2's soul in the process br br the movie then continues with action scenes with 9 trying to rescue his soul yanked compatriots br br they eventually succeed and destroy the machine they release the souls of their fallen friends who go up into the clouds it then rains and we see life returning back to the planet br br hunh br br that makes no sense none at all why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi what did it accomplish were they created to stop the machine everything is dead the machine was dead why bother br br why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had why not create a second intellectual machine but with a soul to fight the first at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success br br why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the machine and then destroy the machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps
<START> i mean the word pedestrian seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen faith domergue can do better than this she is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson there's an idea eh instead she's a common would be housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are all so earnestly all american that the result is laughable this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in the cat people i think cult of the cobra should really be titled cult of the contractual obligation why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow moving predictable derivative failure like this
<START> i am writing this review having watched it several months ago the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie it is a complete joke and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre 1974 which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers hell he might not even be good at that either the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes i don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable that's all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained br br if you want good quality low budget fun far better than this then check out a jeff hayes film because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it br br i gave this 1 star just for the cover art thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called film br br rick blalock
<START> dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick br br its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time br br we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn't since it's br br based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened it's not easy to tell br br i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie i br br didn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended br br
<START> unspeakably discombobulated turkey a mix of anti nazi musical pre war americana and agatha christie whodunit spoof with one big big problem it's deadly unfunny besides the single digit i q plot and dialog the most amazing aspect of lady is the berserk casting gene wilder star and co writer tries hard at it all he plays a romantic lead with his looks and his age he and woody allen should start a club for clueless mirrorless ageing comedians and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart and tries to sing and dance and succeeds in none a looong shot from his good old days with mel brooks br br for a while i thought i was having a myopia fit because everybody in the movie keeps saying cherry jones is this pretty hot chick and that michael cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion the guy who plays claire bloom's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies mike starr's over the top acting as the most incompetent phoniest cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted at least i hope both stars payed their bills back home and subsequently fired their agents with this flop no wonder acting prodigy sukowa returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her br br if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director study this one otherwise stay away 1 10
<START> this time around blackadder is no longer royal or even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh laurie who replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we can't help but care for him which isn't at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daft which he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loud mouthed and utterly non threatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he so frustrated and angry honestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesn't seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someone's head or marry them on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i can't tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away it's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesn't change from last season he's still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof don't get me started on the gross out stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before i'd say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didn't really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general 7 10
<START> yuck i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written the acting is so apathetic at times and so over dramatic at other times why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show lilith's motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere we get it you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket it doesn't mean you have to show it all the time the faith's lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill conceived movies i've seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless you're into bad movies
<START> meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted she was played realistically too she got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt i didn't expect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work i've seen from him and i've really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a 7 but if i could rate just the acting i'd give the it a 9 5 and a perfect 10 for streep
<START> i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november it looked awesome and the songs i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it this is a film which weaves 6 couples together it has a multi cast of 12 people a huge amount of stars have worked on this film i think the director nikhil advani has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him compared to nikhil's directorial debut 'kal ho naa ho' 'salaam e ishq' falls quite behind i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast i think the best factors of this film is the songs the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome shankar ehsaan loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs one thing i was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar i found this extremely rude watching this with family although some may find this nude as comedy it is not something you would want to watch with parents i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall i think its an alright movie
<START> because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway here's the ending as i remember it because i couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but i'll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague abe vigoda was in this movie i don't remember that i didn't even remember that ol' barnabus was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character belinda montgomery is lured by the judge joseph cotton i'm guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind maybe i've got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he's actually her father the devil and she's played right into their the satanic cult's hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess that's robert foxworth turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for belinda montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that's the end the bad guys win
<START> i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the hands down worst film i've seen this year worse than even catwoman which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction br br in september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on sept 11 to track down osama bin laden br br they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentary br br the psychotic idiotic protagonist who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said shoot me br br the crew's translator supposedly their sensible voice of reason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom br br you wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons br br around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew
<START> in the classic sense of the four humors which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment altman's h e a l t h treats all of the humors and actually in very funny entertaining ways there's the phlegm as personified by lauren bacall's very slow guarded and protective character esther brill who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well being there's paul dooley's choleric dr gil gainey who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal flops around frenetically barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness the melancholy of glenda jackson's isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare's troubled and self righteous hamlet even proffering a soliloquy or two and let's not forget henry gibson's bile character bobby hammer the breast that feeds the baby rules the world then there's the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank james garner and carol burnett respectively relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h e a l t h a kind of world trade organization specializing in h e a l t h which is to say anything but health this is altman at his classic best
<START> gruveyman2 comment below you are a complete idiot blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to its that whiny arrogance that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf that makes you seem like such the typical la a hole the only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about sf is because you are jealous of course you don't know it because you are so la jaded first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals it says nothing bad about la and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit the only negative thing that was said that relates to la was about the studio executives the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them but then those same movies went on to be huge world wide grossing films so why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system these are the only people they are trying to disassociate from and for good reasons don't be so sensitive how can you say that francis ford coppola is the so called san francisco director how is he not to be considered that and who directed the godfather coppola did it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award so what who gave him the job he admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie so what's your point and so what if sophia wants to live in la and that proves your point how and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies movies that are now considered classics and when they made movies from studio funding one it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own they said exactly that in the film br br your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film br br how the hell can bitchy ness and self congratulation suddenly have an air of self respect and credence if they never go to la again what a stupid and senseless comment you inserted some big words in there and just don't know how to use them and by the way they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la again what the hell is your point so if they go to la or new york they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in sf you make no sense br br san francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today this film just focused on one aspect film making for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city not the movie but the city and its people only proves what it is we northern californians hate about people from la this is a great documentary very interesting especially if you are from the bay area but i recommend it to anyone
<START> but the keyword here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of b rated movies this one is z rated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite b rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sort of treat the movie lightly even if it's a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10 star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars as i am biased towards movies like this if you're a b rated fan however i would try too hard to find this one
<START> i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme found it touching and sensitive it is not for someone with a reality mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes don't make sense william russ did a grand job as hank i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character but in this one the expression in his eyes throughout as hank considered the things that were happening to him was wonderful and tender valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life it's not for everyone especially those who aren't into 'feel good' movies and this is definitely one if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one but i think it is well worth re watching which is why i taped it yes some of us still have vcrs
<START> watch a team of bomb disposal experts in iraq count down their time before they can go home br br that in itself sounds boring every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home br br i must be missing something i'm a great fan of war films if they are done well this had jarhead syndrome a film that at times was beautifully shot but cinematography doesn't stop it from being totally dull and pointless br br and get over the slow mo cartridges coming out of the gun shot already they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it br br i didn't have any empathy for the main guy in it i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die in fact the film would have worked much better if he had br br i read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it and everyone else loved it i have never been in the forces and i'm with them it's pretentious drivel the 3 stars are for the cinematography
<START> i really tried to like this movie it deals with an important problem in any society sex addiction br br in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex in this case our main character and hero for having non stop sex with all kinds of women crazy kinky neurotic puts in jeopardy his marriage job and even his life br br the production values are terrible mainly the acting oh you won't enjoy any of the sex scenes most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick br br second the plot is just non sense how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband how could she believe him the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while br br also the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking wtf br br scenes like those you will find plenty br br avoid this movie please avoid it it's not soft core it's not a documental it's not a dramatic feature it's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever br br only mrs kinski's legs on display are worth the watch i caught it on hbo and i'm glad i didn't spend my money on it but those 90 minutes of my life won't come back
