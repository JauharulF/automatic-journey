<START> sorry but every time i see a film wherein a woman sucker punches a man and the man does nothing but cower the film looses all credibility so the new female starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground no pun intended dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero type than the new age kattee sackhoff whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as a compelling exciting must see ground breaking performance by the politically correct new speak of today's review copy editors but in essence it is just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse the biggest clichÃ© on screens today i may give this series one more shot but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in as james hilton once bemoaned a story please just give me a story
<START> i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out there the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small time thief to lure a more dangerous thief computer hacker out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good humored but passive or one dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem definetly worth a watch
<START> i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him in my opinion the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production i hope you take the time to view this movie
<START> after seeing 'break a leg' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film br br i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos eric roberts in particular were a scream i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close br br the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations the script is smooth and seamless the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in which is around 10 15 or so br br i highly recommend 'break a leg'
<START> what a horrible movie i cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re make please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film mehki pfifer is great in e r and ving rhames probably didn't know what he was doing i feel terrible for them the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was could ever distroy such a great classic film this film should not have been made in the first place an advice to everyone who has seen it please tell me that i'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it br br boooooo 10 out of 10
<START> i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this not the worst acting i've ever seen but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes it leaves a bit to be desired there wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'halloween' on the tv all around it seems like it could've been a good story rolling the credits and saying that chasey lain was in it was a bit of a loss as i didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i could've said 'oh yeah there she is' i'm so glad i saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as i'd be real ticked if i had payed a cent to see this i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie but this one is an exception it's so bad that it's not even that amusing so good it's bad it's just plain bad
<START> young mr lincoln is a poetic beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about it is perhaps the actors best performance watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching mob alice brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand but i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good
<START> if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy in fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect beauty and soul of powell and pressburger's masterpiece the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made raf bomber command lost 58 000 men during the war the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active combatants there's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing when richar attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939 45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates it's obvious nazis don't go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it's replaced by american ambitions there's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture one is the ethnic mix of america even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51 of americans are white european the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess i am an american as peter is judged by abraham farlan an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence as for the special relationship between britain and america what special relationship powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america they obviously know their future too br br so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present it's strange beautiful poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq
<START> i haven't seen this movie in a while so i'm afraid i can't be very specific about details it did have some interesting points ralph bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of j r r tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production therefore not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made the film itself seems less than finished it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed but whether or not it's intentional is hard to say the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone especially the orcs and the nazgul another problem of course is the huge gaps in the plot bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time far too many important bits were left out and i don't refer only to tom bombadil which i think was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie and of course the ending which is completely sudden and out of place i'm not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it br br the characters well most of them were okay the hobbits don't look so bad except for the gay sam did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character if you're a tolkien fanatic like me watch this movie though i'm not too sure about buying it what special features does the dvd version have anyway but know in advance that you're not going to watch a real 'lord of the rings movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool the idea was to cast george as gandalf paul as frodo ringo as sam and john as gollum if you didn't read the book or didn't like it much or don't like animation films or don't want to see a half finished movie stay away
<START> excellent documentary ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro rock'n'roll bands the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath anton newcomb and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world interestingly for a music documentary there is hardly any music what there is snatches of songs more often than not aborted by the performers is incidental rather than central although the protagonists are musicians the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle ie one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full time basis tantrums drugs violence grossly dysfunctional attitudes egomania on a truly epic scale all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about as a film this is a first class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers for example why is anton's music so conservative for someone so wild and outrageous and he is wild and outrageous his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols the stones velvets etc for someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level similarly the dandy warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969 nothing wrong with pastiches of course but surely there's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s why don't they take some risks with their music in the way that their role models did because one suspects this is not about music music is just an accessory a prop or an excuse to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives but why in the dandy warhols case the answer is obvious to make lots of money and be famous big deal anton newcomb's case is more interesting he is obviously very talented but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it usually in the most dramatic way possible he is terrified of success and at the same time deeply resents anyone else who has it especially his former friends the dandy warhols fascinating movie highly recommended
<START> i feel like i've just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn't stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i'm neither puritanical nor humorless i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesn't have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
<START> this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn br br now that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as it's issues are still widely available it's funny the acting is great and it raises serious curious questions br br i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot grrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but aren't we all
<START> oh brother the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy but even as a longtime stooges fan i'd have to say that young moe larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr healy's taller boss janitor they're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on and off again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing br br most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen here's a good example of the level of humor i object on what grounds coffee grounds his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore
<START> this film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie heck even seen in its proper context it's pretty bad mostly this is due to a silly plot and very self indulgent direction by the famed italian director michelangelo antonioni in this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an anti establishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportions br br the film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon a bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed our hero mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution instead of heading to mexico or canada he does what only a total moron would do steals an airplane and flies it to the mojave desert there he meets a happen' chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours then they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history as they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene while you see a bit of skin warranting an r rating it's not as explicit as it could have been in fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind and of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin air br br oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a peter max creation despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary when the girl finds out she goes into a semi catatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times then inexplicably you see tvs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion while dumb it is rather cool to watch sort of like when david letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show br br aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing at least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bit especially since there really isn't all that much plot or dialog the bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and i was not surprised to see it listed in the fifty worst films book by harry medved it's a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap for such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime br br two final observations if you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching the trial of billy jack also in a case of art imitating life the lead mark frechette acted out his character in real life he died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person dang hippies
<START> this is one of those movies that you happen across when you're channel surfing on a saturday afternoon and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters though it's a bit slow moving focusing more on the relationships between bonnie and clyde and their family members it never got boring we don't really see too much of all the robberies that they were so legendary for and instead most of the shootouts take place when they're ambushed by the police i thought tracey needham who played bonnie really did a good job with her character going from a nice country girl to a cold blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray and i enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role br br overall an above average effort especially considering it was a made for tv movie
<START> then you must see this film to understand the reality having read the book ms duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder formerly labeled manic depression br br it is hard to believe that in this day and age people still critique others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists and this is unfortunate br br in this film the audience sees the pain and suffering ms duke had been through especially as a child many of us may remember her from the teenage patty duke show she was a household name in america by age 15 br br you learn of her exploitation by the ross' well played by howard hesseman as she was growing up in the 1950's the stigma was in full force however we see as she advances in her career yet the illness becomes worse she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity even marries someone whom she divorces the next week and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication br br a recent survey released by nami national alliance on mental illness recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to bp magazine winter 2006 if you watch this film you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not pull herself up by her bootstraps and get well until she was educated about her disorder and received proper treatment thank you ms duke for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice
<START> this is one of jackies best films that is him without opera buddies sammo hung and yuen biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy
<START> and i have seen some bad ones br br i have nothing good to say about this movie the acting is poor by jennifer tilly as to be expected daryl hannah does an ok job but nothing close to being able to save this movie br br the biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak though based on a good premise that the writer resorted to the stupid heroine trick to create a contrived suspense when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide she runs out in front of her pursuer the hospital scene is absurd without exposing too much of what passes for a plot i think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed lame very lame br br save yourself some time and pick out another flick
<START> i vowed a long time ago to never ever watch a movie that has anyone who ever was a regular cast member of saturday night live i didn't rent corky romano but i was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour then my good manners failed stupid not funny tedious not hilarious bad not good that in a nutshell is all i can say for this video
<START> after beau travail everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow up masterpiece that never arrived now it has denis makes a quantum leap in this film an orgy of gorgeous cinematography elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger there's a nominal plot derived partly from the jean luc nancy book of the same name about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago but mostly it's an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend and has pacing problems close to the end but it's still more advanced and gripping than anything else i've seen this year miss it at your peril
