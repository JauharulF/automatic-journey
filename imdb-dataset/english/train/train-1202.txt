<START> two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different women they come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant ivory br br great scenery and the location isn't bad either seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
<START> i was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television being raised in texas i understood the boredom monotony of teenage life there this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart i remembered it fondly through the past 12 years i recently got to see it for the 2nd 3rd 4th times thanks the the love channel i still cry because the movie reaches in touches my inner confused teenager
<START> i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score br br either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that's about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo types br br to sum it up it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen stay away
<START> i watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever br br however i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one i had never seen before graham greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as thin man and in lesser vehicles confidential agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of bacall and boyer's depictions as respectively british and spanish and the almost complete non existence of any chemistry between the two leads in some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy the most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from greene's complex and guilt ridden psychology which pervades the film i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and i can understand that yet i found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world i was compelled to watch not by any great acting although boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the down spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money what is a thief what good is love in the face of death where does mere profit taking end and exploitation begin the film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn the lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhile br br and there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending
<START> this movie is wonderful it always has been always will be i'm mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love walt really out did him self here and the music a dream is a wish your heart makes is beautiful what else can you say besides terrific i can't wait until the special edition comes out it will be so awesome i can't wait to hear all of the deleted songs this movie is done so beautiful and smart it is lovely what about the cute mice too i know i keep saying the same things over and over and over again but hey this is a great movie woods was terrific in this beautiful beautiful beautiful movie
<START> in some ways the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried's death but it also loses some of that film's greatness the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first which is quite amazing the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through until that is you get to the climactic battle scenes only the iliad's are better lang and harbou embellished the huns the poet compiler of the nibelungenlied didn't know a hun from his right ball and as a result they are more or less the same as the burgundians in custom for example although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen which is kriemhild's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him when she gets to hunland the first thing she does is go to mass the huns here are clearly heathens they're almost like caveman the depiction of them is hilarious especially verbal the jester who has two marvelous scenes etzel's character has been given more weight he is much more formidable all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense especially at the banquet scene which is intercut with verbal's second performance to an amazing effect however as is the nature of this half of the poem the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one for the most part except for a dazzling sequence where etzel's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending spoilers in the poem after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther they are imprisoned kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother when hagen still refuses she decapitates him hildebrand or possibly dietrich is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he in turn decapitates her calling her a devil woman etzel who is much weaker in the poem than he is here says something silly like ah me i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic i also understand why they didn't have hildebrand kill kriemhild his character is much reduced here his name is only mentioned once but to have kriemhild kill herself adopting brynhild's death from the icelandic sources is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them the point of the poem is that kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil here we simply have her die for her lost love it's not as interesting
<START> i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures' latest release 'the return' i myself along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film on the contrary though its actually a supernatural thriller too bad it is not the least bit thrilling br br 'the return' stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met while in texas on a business trip she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown la salle there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions a man by the name of terry stahl who is played by peter o'brien joanna is now on a desperate search for answers a search that could in the end result in her very own murder br br i really don't know where to begin here folks which should i mention first the atrocious acting hideous directing or the terribly bland story no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck adam sussman's screenplay is downright moronic its not interesting its not compelling its just plain unpleasant i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film i've placed quotations around film because i don't believe 'the return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it's foulness and at least give it some slight chance of hope but nothing ever happened i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film i assume this is why the acting was so awful at least that's what i'm choosing to believe i really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances they need immediate medical attention if they do br br now the directing was unmistakably bad but i can't quite crucify asif kapadia entirely well i could but i won't since i'm such a nice guy i look at 'the return' as a test for kapadia because for all of you that don't know this is his first full length feature film he's just getting his foot in the door and still learning next time around well if there is a next time hopefully he will have improved vastly the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispel's 2003 re make of 'the texas chainsaw massacre' now that's nice the film was given that but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that copying someone else's work isn't something i consider to be praise worthy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed br br i think jim sonzero's american re make of 'pulse' will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to 'the return' it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way now i don't doubt this will make a small and i mean very small profit no matter what though it won't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellar's previous acting effort 'the grudge' on that note there's one last thing i'd like to add i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'the return' that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself
<START> silly often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim jeff daniels and the people in his orbit br br am always amazed by daniels he showed such depth and promise in 1983's terms of endearment as shirley maclaine's philandering son in law as the years have passed daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good meaty role instead he is in inane comedies such as dumb and dumber br br as for this picture it fails because of the subject matter at least the television show brought about a variety of situations in the film we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian martin br br the part of mrs brown is a perfect example of the non success of the film on television pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed in the film version a blond bomb shell as brown tries romantic entanglement br br television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent or is he really that br br a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much
<START> painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance after 30 minutes into the film you would be in touch your inner scourge and say bahumbag at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point out of all the actors involved in this mess only paul giamatti and rachel weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film paul giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he's forced to vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting you can see in giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film rachel weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film fortunately for her she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face unlike giamatti who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie the direction also feels uninspiring like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down br br i don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved giamatti and weisz trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand and this is a christmas movie of all things and a actor who just does not care about his performance vaughn you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch
<START> first of all i apologize for my english br br everybody from ex yugoslavia who isn't some extreme serbian radical will agree with me this movie shows serbian side and only serbian side no serbian crimes were represented luckily everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians so there is no neutrality all ''professionals'' who were interviewed are not professionals at all some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian the other one is genocide denier etc etc br br even slovenians were accused in this movie and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days and only because slovenians were lucky there weren't many serbs in slovenia and yna couldn't reach slovenia trough croatia after croatia serbia war started every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie br br every reasonable croat will agree with one thing the independence was too early perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided however mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies all over the internet and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna now on serbian and montenegro side and 100 full of serbs and montenegrin and let's not start about the chetnik movement at the beginning it was simply a resistance movement but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis including ustashe ethnic cleansing and fighting again the yugoslav partisans there are thousands of other things but all of it can be easily checked there are many misleading things in this movie only few of all accusations are true every croatian is outraged by this movie br br i believe that i don't need to mention srebrenica genocide denial the genocide that has too many evidence imagine the movie about holocaust denial this movie is the same and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie br br somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian fyrom land by the serbs br br croatians slovenians bosnians and macedonians never entered serbian borders if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats bosnian muslims and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history so br br even 50 of serbs will say that this movie is ''little'' extreme and pro serbian br br and serbian radicals are very very pleased with this movie there is about 40 serbs who vote for radicals br br i think everyone understands my points in here in this so called documentary is very little truth and my advice to everyone is inform yourself before watching this movie after that you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations br br watch real neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia
<START> yes i'll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk
<START> an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold br br people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed br br kitty barbara bouchet is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it franziska marina malfatti is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i know br br the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
<START> me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting wow the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it'd been done the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor ever it's a shame i'm even calling him an actor the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny so if you want a good laugh see it but other than that stay far away from this one i usually love b list movies and such but this one i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video this one is the worst i've seen and i've seen some bad ones
<START> this documentary now available free on video google com is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice everyone must see this br br chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998 his platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20 middle class to the 80 poor he banned foreign drift net fishing in venezuelan waters he sent 10 000 cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free he wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities br br but it was his 30 tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the bush administration in 2002 while irish film makers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were interviewing chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs a cia backed coup was launched with the cameras rolling chavez was captured and flown out of the country it was announced on national tv that he had 'resigned' br br but the poor of venezuela didn't believe the media they went to the palace in their millions and demanded that chavez be returned in the face of such overwhelming numbers the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the us chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation
<START> good work by everyone from scriptwriters director and cast a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only a good film for television on those cloudy cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy
<START> a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his br br still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy the scene where she stares at him across the cat's head with her dark painted on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic it's a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply as he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee
<START> the brilliant thing about withnail i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15 16 i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days had some great mates hate to think what they're all up to now probably running the local council i've watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection how can i like this film and the dambusters doesn't seem right somehow i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity i have tried to obtain the soundtrack but it has not been released shame as it's a corker someone told me it was originally a stage play not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun i liked the little shakespearian touches references that seem to crop up throughout the film also spotted the dylan thomas ref as well and like all little gems there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to easyrider as they start they're next journey all in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making love it
<START> personally i couldn't get into 'this is not a love song' its a brilliant film and there's a great story line to it i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the film br br i love the relationship between spike and heaton there that close they depend on each other to get along in life at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is heaton is in love with spike but spike ibsen't in love with heaton or he doesn't know how to love him the acts of betrayal on both parts have a big effect on the two men they are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them at a time when they truly needed each other for survival
<START> fred claus somehow avoids becoming this year's the santa clause by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater br br as holiday movies go it's contrived and sentimental but actually that could be the least of one's concern as fred claus boasting of having david dobkin shanghai knights the wedding crashers at the helm contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film in the end it amounts to not much of both and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti kevin spacey rachel weisz and kathy bates all the more it leaves one disappointed br br vaughn plays fred nick's giamatti older and estranged brother who once upon a time left him and their parents bates and trevor peacock after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling nick grows up to be santa claus and as the voice over tells us time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint while fred becomes a yuletide jaded repo man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda's weisz birthday br br he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who eerily looks at least a decade older than him to bail him out of jail nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy wrapping business up in the north pole fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature even as an efficiency expert spacey is checking on the toy factory operations only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail br br the film as said does have its moments but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration in between are piles of christmas film clichÃ©s that were handled better in say elf and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake br br vaugn as usual brings on his coarse charm to the table but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing giamatti underneath the bad fat suit brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character but unfortunately has to play second fiddle to fred spacey brings his game face but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid br br ultimately fred claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve sure there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema but there are certainly far better ways
<START> in panic in the streets richard widmark plays u s navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague as cop paul douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest that's not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease br br as was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director elia kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from louisiana having been to new orleans where the story takes place i can personally attest to that richard widmark and his wife barbara bel geddes can be excused because as a navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesn't work br br but with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the new orleans pd starts a dragnet of the city's underworld the dead guy came off a ship from europe and he had underworld connections a new orleans wise guy played by jack palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice br br personally my favorite in this film is zero mostel this happened right before mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies he plays the same kind of role in the humphrey bogart film the enforcer sadly i can kind of identify with mostel in that last chase scene where he and palance are being chased down by widmark douglas and half the new orleans police seeing the weight challenged zero trying to keep up with palance was something else because i'm kind of in zero's league now in the heft department br br kazan kept the action going at a good clip there's very little down time in this film if there was any less it would be an indiana jones film panic in the streets won an oscar for best original screenplay that year br br kazan also made good use of the new orleans waterfront and the french quarter some of the same kinds of shots are later used in on the waterfront in fact panic in the streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest very similar again to on the waterfront br br panic in the streets does everyone proud who was associated with it now why couldn't elia kazan get some decent new orleans sounding people in the small roles
