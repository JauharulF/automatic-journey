<START> i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever i didn't realize it was disney until it was too late i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story it was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader's book report on the novel meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses mrs murray meg's mother was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet and that's just the beginning by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright
<START> this is a very old and cheaply made film a typical low budget b western in so many ways gary cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of john wayne that were done for poverty row studios with both actors their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed this incarnation of gary cooper doesn't seem exactly like the cooper of just a few years later he talks faster in this early film among other things br br however unlike the average b movie of the era there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique if not good if you ever want to see the woman that was married to errol flynn for seven years this is your chance lili damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very very odd casting choice as she has a heavy accent she was french and wasn't even close to being movie star pretty incidentally she was also married to director michael curtiz br br but for me the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot sort of like a brokeback mountain from the 1930s and we thought this was a new idea gary cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females this misogyny alone doesn't necessarily mean much but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple in particular towards the end when one of them is killed the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls with his arms cradled around him this was pretty edgy stuff for the time and i think this makes this dull film really fascinating today as far as cooper and the plot go the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip able unless you are curious about damita or the homosexual undertones do yourself a favor and find a better western
<START> dreamquest is by far the best porn movie i've ever viewed this is a must see and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it just skip over the naughty scenes of course this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes but even then it's enjoyable this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie even shawshank redemption
<START> this movie is just plain bad it isn't even worth watching to make fun of it the lunatic professor is just plain annoying even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility which i glady do for the sake of good bad movies and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie this movie asks for even more than that if you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters get a porn if you are looking for a good bad movie get something else if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie rent this
<START> the movie seems disjointed and overall poorly written the screenplay moves along as if 10 different people wrote it and none of them were communicating with each other apparently they wanted to take a page from a miracle on 34th street the original type film but it is done in such a poor way that the movie falls apart this film is for only the very young and even they will see the fact that whoever scripted it knows little to nothing about baseball such as br br Â when the angels are in dead last place the owner doesn't seem to care nor is he bothered by the fact his manager just got into a fight with his pitcher Â on the mound Â or that he punched the team's play by play announcer on live tv however when the team is one game from winning the division he gets bent out of shape over a story sourced by a 6 year old that the manager is getting help from a kid who claims to see real angels what sounds worse a losing violent out of control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row or a winning coach on the verge of the playoffs that is acting a bit eccentric and is helping foster kids the owner's reaction makes no sense and he's moved to change his mind by maggie and her 'straight out of clichÃ© land' speech during a news conference br br Â the angels are supposed to be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the white sox however at the end of the game the announcer's keep saying the angels 'won the pennant the pennant is not decided until someone wins the league championship not the regular season division title br br Â whitt bass the goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the angels losing streak Â then is the starting pitcher Â the very next day br br Â mel clark tony danza is said in the ninth inning to have thrown 156 pitches in a low scoring ballgame typically in low scoring games the pitch count is much lower than this usually around 80 90 pitches br br Â al the angel says at the end championships have to be won on their own even though he and his angels have been manipulating and fixing games throughout the whole second half of the season br br i could go on and on as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written br br for younger kids under 10 this movie may be entertaining it's too bad Â done right this could have been a classic done wrong like this and it's a forgettable mess that will forever live as a uhf cable saturday morning washout
<START> loved joan great performance what isn't she good in i watched this film and then jane eyre right after she just keeps getting better my heart was racing great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie facial expressions are worth the whole film i'm glad i have it on video don't know what more you need in a film beautiful woman wealth greed murder detectives a trial br br the costumes are very nice makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie films in black and white still hold a certain mystery
<START> this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experience br br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching at first you think its a drama you're watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre br br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o'toole and susannah york amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough' br br the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out br br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project br br really not worth your time br br 4 10
<START> this was a horrible film i gave it 2 points one for angelina jolie and a second one for the beautiful porsche in the beginning other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970 the happyend was probably what annoyed me the most seldomly seen anything so constructed
<START> worst film ever this is a statement that people here on imdb often throw around whether it's an uwe boll movie bad classics like manos the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from michael bay people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world br br i envy these people because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes there are films out there so bad so hideous so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad br br ladies and gentlemen i present to you ben and arthur an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it the brainchild of self proclaimed hollywood actor director and may i add beached whale sam mraovich this film is legendarily terrible let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was mr mraovich not only directed this film he wrote it produced it executive produced it scored it edited it and then finally starred in it this is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is br br everything in this film fails on an epic level the acting is the worst you will ever witness the plot is the most ridiculous the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard i'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust don't get me wrong i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting for example as much as i disliked it the blair witch project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film ben and arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with hollywoods finest actors it would still suck the plot is that atrocious and the characters are even worse one of the main characters arthur who is portrayed by non other than sam mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film you'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing apparently mr mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero br br i don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie in one cut we hear one of the main characters say how they know a good lawyer and will give him a call the shot fades out then fades back in and this him they spoke of earlier is actually a woman quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think the second is simple seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to vermont we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area i've never been to vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there br br imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for ben and arthur imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as ben and arthur this film is really that bad br br however we should be glad in a way films like this are a true rarity they give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this br br the real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered and it is called ben and arthur
<START> you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed that's why movies like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones we live on a tiny island and i cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the sea br br and these movies are relatively easy to make hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic for once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame however they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park the guy sitting beside me i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans br br so there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage as does the gt here the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification that even i'm impressed alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that has wings for doors but seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment i mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they can br br there's no story in redline just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator mind you tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steering wheels gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks not a very tall order for an actor and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids br br the heroine yes it made a statement that girls can drive natasha a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts lubricants and going for rides introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous eddie griffin she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle everything else well like i said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race br br and it's almost always the same as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker sun kang and of course the star it created vin diesel redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man one car and a 105 minutes race against time to get to vegas br br if not for the cars then this movie seriously is a piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines
<START> my dear lord what a movie let's talk about the special effects first don't get me wrong here i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past mainly the 60's so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60's br br what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message acting is secondary effects are secondary i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies however in a movies like this bad acting incredibility etc add up to make a bad movie even worse that's what happened for me with the celestine prophecy br br my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way the movie failed to do so br br there could be one single reason to watch this one though if you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten stars br br by the way three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there like critical mass look up the comments on that one hilarious the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree
<START> since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it the colorado i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john lithgow plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his element he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at it's best i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining br br you don't need 50 000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shell shocked
<START> the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of '89 and again in '92 i believe it made a round on american tv on a e it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90's but went out of print a u s company released it on dvd later but that version also sold out according to the website of the author of the book the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay br br i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks it's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east even though the dvd says made in canada ha ha but it's a good copy and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare out of print and lost in legal disputes br br i love the movie it's a period piece set in the 1920's with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark for the most part the movie is very low key but effective and scary there is no self indulgent gore violence or much at all in special effects but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments it's a chilling classic styled ghost movie the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color without all the flash of all the modern horror movies i'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem for me it places itself as one of my all time favorites
<START> claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will br br ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non linear film is the older man living on the french swiss border a man devoted to his dogs who still has a lover but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago br br what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul the vastness of nature man's interaction with people vs animals etc much of the time the 'film' doesn't make sense but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures life is sort of like that we look see observe integrate process and make of it what we will br br in using this form of film making much as she did in the strangely beautiful 'beau travail' claire denis has developed a signature technique whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information this is an interesting and visually captivating film but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little perhaps watching again will change that grady harp
<START> not a movie for everyone but this movie is in my top 10 i am a lover of black comedy with a cast including richard dreyfus vic jeff goldblum mick larry bishop nick and gabriel byrne ben 'brass balls' london in the leads the lines can't help but be dry the supporting cast is nearly dead center counting the minor flaws in the movie ellen barkin's make up gave her face has a washed out look there were a couple of gimme cameos by joey bishop and richard pryor that served no purpose and michael j pollard's screen time was too short over all the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script if you have seen larry bishop's writer director film underworld a dark crime flick you will enjoy this one his next outing writer director actor is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino
<START> acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york's social set oh yes don't forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder the all star cast features barbara stanwyck van heflin james mason ava gardner cyd charisse and nancy davis
<START> there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortier's plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series maybe it's the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all
<START> i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc br br but everything in this movie is bad farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time br br it's a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old br br i'm surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
<START> let's see where to begin bad acting i'm not sure if i'd even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters br br to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants br br budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home shot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i don't care who directed it br br i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suck fest
<START> i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but i just couldn't do it brad dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse br br the whole thing is just ludicrous from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot br br complete waste of time don't bother root canal therapy would be more enjoyable bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant br br watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this get the idea
