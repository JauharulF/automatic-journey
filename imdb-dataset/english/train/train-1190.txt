<START> this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post apocalyptic environment br br the cobweb strewn shops and rubble laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best br br while the parable can be a bit heavy handed by today's drama standards it is an excellent one using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr bronson and ms montgomery who do not disappoint may they both rest in peace br br a true classic
<START> spoiler this is a great film about a conure he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds if you love birds like my wife does this film is for you this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this
<START> even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites so maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage it's all downhill from here unfortunately reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here half of the time you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn't franco's best film according to me i wouldn't even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you're looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on 'las vampiras' 'the awful dr orloff' or 'female vampire'
<START> i have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it number 274 to be exact br br the title had me going at first splatter university i thought this would be a great horror movie was i ever wrong don't get me wrong this is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it could have been a lot better i love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare br br poor audio quality poor acting and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved 3 out of 10 stars br br movie is ideal for a good laugh if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one
<START> that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days br br first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie br br i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder br br second indie films are supposed to be about real people there's nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely human br br what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is br br sorry but this is not good writing or good directing br br what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted br br in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand
<START> i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes br br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got it br br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuff br br despite it's low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger br br a must for old school horror fans
<START> it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good br br nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out he's visited by a jovial american john goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an anti semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will modify nolte's radio scripts inserting a cough here a sneeze there that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies there's a catch though nobody will know about nolte's real role as an american agent except goodman donovan and roosevelt himself if he's ever uncovered he'll be refused recognition by the americans br br nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany his adored wife sheryl lee knows nothing of what's going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud he's rescued by goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then br br by 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists led by a dentist and a priest his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations he's beaten senseless by an ex gi but miraculously his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans another catch it turns out later that it's not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence br br the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity it's not a happy ending br br nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail it's adolf eichmann eichmann seems pleasant enough he advises nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours it's important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts that's how i got here the film is filled with such ironies at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary br br the fact is that it's a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly there's very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the war time relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty compact phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import br br it's a story of a man who loses everything his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth adolescents might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring br br remember robert frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in
<START> the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright yet volatile lights of broadway filled with typically naÃ¯ve optimism of course their first attempt fails and kermit leader of the group and author of the show blows his top so the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous non sequiturs we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars art carney as a producer james coco as an overzealous dog owner dabney coleman as a confidence trickster elliott gould who was also in the muppet movie 1979 gregory hines liza minnelli as herself Â having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermit's sporting fake moustache as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets' show brooke shields and even director john landis in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces with regrettably less space given to gonzo this time around while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermit's romance with the waitress Â and especially her violent reaction to this Â are undeniably funny what disappoints however is the climactic show itself after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue which rather than the expected splashy routines procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy
<START> can scarcely imagine a better movie than this br br hey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast br br i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course cloris leachman also in this film in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for more still more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 3 9 br br that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish hey o k i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked br br it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad and how predictable my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
<START> i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'scoop' last night full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause i didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves br br 'scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman br br 'scoop' isn't a bad addition to the woody allen filmography it isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp i'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film right in the middle of the pack if you're a woody allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself if you're indifferent to his work then 'scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more i don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film making and acting are going to change their mind woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words woody allen fans know what to expect br br very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with 'match point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that woody gives her could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship i'm glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it more sophisticated comedy than movies like 'scary movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former 'scoop' probably isn't for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun 'scoop' is for you probably not the woody allen film i'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try
<START> i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings well so i was and so i really love this movie especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf the brave and wise and completely humorless know it all wizard almghandi the cowardice and brain dead transvestite sauron's counterpart sauraus from east germany of course is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ulrike the legend with scotch tape and strunzdumm the counterpart of wormtong indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif and don't forget grmpfli and heidi huh huh
<START> this one is a real bomb we are supposed to believe that merle oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the tom delay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate poor merle can't go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle harry davenport she joins her two maids on a blind date and gary cooper happens to show up some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things a la misfits but no such luck with this one gary later breaks in to a formal dinner at which merle is presiding and though invited to sit down and join the group reads them a lecture on their snobbery where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from the most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife merle will it never end one to avoid
<START> telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo i've e mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica overall xica merits a 10 out of 10
<START> watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world greenlit this crap a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people and where exactly are they they're in the desert then they're skiing then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle there's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere
<START> this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wow br br it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman's fault br br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothly and made the characters completely believable br br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare br br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80's sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie br br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly br br then there is the story what can i say how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time br br any one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it i didn't want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person to travel it's fields and valleys stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different br br in the end i'm sure that neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
<START> this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made for tv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close strange too since netflix shows that it was rated r br br nonetheless very titillating and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like this br br one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is i'd like to find out though because this movie was that good br br walt d in lv 8 23 2005
<START> in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings that said casanova left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski br br casanova died too just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas all hollow inside like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children br br as far as i could make it out this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonetheless br br casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in satyricon the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the coherence and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction br br yet there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious fellini couldn't more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a maestro for sure but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film it was a story not worth telling
<START> drew latham ben affleck is determined not to be lonely this christmas not only is drew a millionaire but also obnoxious and guilty of being very grandiose drew goes back to the home he grew up in and offers the family living there the valco's 250 000 to be his family through the christmas season tom valco james gandolfini is reluctant but is greedy enough to take drew's offer christine valco catherine o'hara has little to say in the matter but learns to like having drew around not exactly the same sentiment with daughter alicia christina applegate but that too has room for change drew's girlfriend missy jennifer morrison tracks down drew and wants her folks to meet his family genuine fun is in store as a happy noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare other members of the cast josh zuckerman bill macy david selby and stephanie faracy affleck is comedic albeit strange
<START> the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood although the vo accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story the choice of combining b w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense the close ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do worth watching more than once
<START> when viewing a movie as silly as 'hot rod ' one must sit back relax and alter one's intellectual capacity to a like state Â which is in this case a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy with a brief runtime of 88 minutes this film was long past drawn out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes Â jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place 'hot rod''s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004's cult hit 'napoleon dynamite ' though it's much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter in fact the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to 'napoleon dynamite' is scornful and offensive and left me ticked off instead of just being annoyed br br the movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a paltry story that puts self proclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol evel knievel jumped so we're told by rod and raising 50 000 dollars for his stepfather's impending life saving heart operation all so that he can fight his stepfather once recovered and gain his respectÂ because in order to gain one's respect one must first fight them huh whatever each character is no more interesting than rod's stick on mustache and from the film's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny snl skit Â which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what 'hot rod' strives to be br br the film's star andy samberg contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip drop of his comedic capabilities unfortunately Â rather realistically Â his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five year old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee pee gags and if that's disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and brace yourself for the real blow he is the film's humor to rescue them of their mortification i'll willingly omit the ghastliness of samberg's co stars' roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team director akiva schaffer to his non existent talent as a directorÂ or a comedian basically every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash course comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so arrogantly as though the film would be funnier that way trick yourself into believing that there's even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie Â any other movie
