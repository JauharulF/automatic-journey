<START> i don't usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to start br br the acting on jeremy london's part was horrible i didn't think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start br br well at least i got good laughs i wouldn't waste my time if i were you
<START> oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d w griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as 'the yellow man' characters so unimaginative and un engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film br br prizzi's honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post modern disaster in every which way possible the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character prizzi's honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo noir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime Â this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no Â what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all br br i'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is firstly the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time charley partanna nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoo's nest more than an international hit man he meets and falls in love with irene walker turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out it appears all is not right i read that the plot for this film is a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other well yes that's true but that actual revelation doesn't happen until about twenty minutes to the end nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin Â one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard bodied best of the best international hit man br br so with a main character who is un likable and un realistic we move to the script the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again do i marry her do i love her what is love what do i do and it gets so repetitive it's not even able to act as good humour this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called maerose prizzi huston played by director john's daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it Â that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny should i be laughing the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding alÃ¡ the godfather and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters police men and assassins were introduced into the film but what we get is something very very different br br the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with Â maybe the film will kick start i was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs Â the scene isn't even edited correctly some suspense some drama do i shoot or don't i maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late Â anything but how it was actually executed prizzi's honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax it's a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged prizzi's honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film goer and don't say it was a comedy because i didn't laugh with it Â at it is another matter the film is repetitive drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality there is no honour here
<START> for some reason tv guide gave this two and a half stars plus faye dunaway is in it so it definitely looked like something to see my oh my this may be the worst film i've ever seen ever from its horrid acting every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him i shouted to the tv i can't act when she asks what he needs i yell i need acting lessons to the unbelievably bad dialog give me back my organs br br and the brian depalma wannabe ending too it was all just beyond awful i wanted to like it dunaway is one of the best actors ever and the production values were pretty good br br but wowzers this had me laughing laughing most of the time br br don't even bother out of curiosity that was my first mistake staying with it was definitely my second and third and fourth
<START> watch on the rhine is one of the best anti nazi propaganda films made during world war two paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was i would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great ms bette davis
<START> a stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients despite an initially hostile response he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor and as the doctor shows him about he talks and talks and talks and as he talks loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive while there is some action here and there and some of it quite disturbing it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is lacking life and energy which is odd for a horror flick even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome the further this tour takes the guest the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers yet again despite this twist the film is amazingly lifeless in many places particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell starving does the film have any real impact considering this plot it sure is hard to imagine making it boring but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have now with the same plot and competent writing acting and direction this could have been an interesting and worthwhile film br br you know now that i think about it this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original star trek tv show you know the one with lord garth master of the universe and kirk and spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers br br a final note the film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene so be forewarned it's not for kids in fact considering how worthless the film is it isn't for anyone however with the version included in the 50 movie pack chilling classics the print is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark
<START> as a south african it's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense br br despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini this addition to the series is appalling the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist leader and warrior a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africa br br the plot of this film however is nothing but hogwash scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid nineties br br while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors what is david hasselhoff doing here rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile br br i kept expecting blond busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason not that this would've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next blockbuster
<START> people are being too hard on the film sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to review it br br the whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down then the fun begins as everyone about him also go down br br just think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination who's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this film br br i think it's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred though the exact story line my not have been followed hindsight here after reading jim maars crossfire but it's what is implied that is of interest br br i'd love to get a copy of it to view it again in light of what is known today the domino principle is right on
<START> this movie will confuse you to death furthermore if your a denise richards' fan don't even think of renting this movie besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about 10 minutes of air time if that she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots
<START> even though we know how the story ends this is a gripping fly on the wall film that plays almost like a political thriller during the calm before the storm we meet hugo chavez as a charismatic larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80 of the population but have previously been shut out of venezuela's political process and its oil wealth he seems as devoted to them as they are to him he travels the country at a hectic pace reaching out to the campesinos addressing huge crowds hugging and kissing ordinary people accepting letters on scraps of paper and hearing pleas for help the people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land there is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios br br but not everyone is happy with the situation the pure blood castillian spaniard elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an ann coulter lookalike at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community complains of the mestizos they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice minutes later a speaker tells the meeting to beware of your domestic servants they could be chavez supporters duh of course they are br br in a late night interview alone with the film crew chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather he can be a sensitive poetic person though with an impish even clownish sense of humor like we saw when he addressed the un and called bush the devil br br then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace knowing it is surrounded by chavez supporters and violence is inevitable br br another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the chavez supporters some of whom fire back the local equivalent of fox news shows this return fire and claims that chavez supporters are massacring protesters then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters the street is empty the protesters took a different route needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti chavez private tv stations who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on fidel castro immediately after the coup we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly bragging on tv about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike br br the filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic fast changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him where the us how can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right wing generals and ultra wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the bush administration watch the movie and find out br br if your only knowledge of hugo chavez and venezuela is from the us media then you know nothing he is not an unelected tyrant and does not rule by decree he is enormously popular having been elected and re elected several times with over 60 of the vote something george bush junior has never achieved and the devotion he inspires in ordinary venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails br br this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation the skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace the tumultuous scenes the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense riveting and moving not to be missed
<START> another chapter in the ongoing question whatever happened to mel brooks's sense of humor it starts out nicely enough with mel as trump like mogul goddard bolt you can call me god who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days but the moment the movie hits the streets it turns into a pathos laden mess with occasional funny bits interjected mel sees a black kid break dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck and wing yuk yuk leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted the worst part is this movie's musical number in which brooks and warren do a silent dance to cole porter's easy to love brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies here he plays the whole thing straight like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on the carol burnett show on which rudy deluca this film's co writer began his career go rent charlie chaplin's the kid which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot
<START> extremely interesting and intriguing movie the similarities to david lynch who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film and the novels of franz kafka the house keeper in this film is called mrs grubach as is the one in der prozess are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of belgium in africa the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe this colonialism is an important part as is the inability to cope with such a past but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well and his quest for social contact and love these are the symbolic themes i deduced from the movie but in fact they're no more than impressions br br but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery beautiful close ups of beatles larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style maybe you can say that i didn't quite 'get' the film but i have been watching like hypnothised for 1 5 hour deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity
<START> not good rent or buy the original watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then maybe br br it is like claiming an elvis actor is as good as the real king
<START> a police officer robert forster in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station after the murderers get off scot free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking fred williamson these robin hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him br br this film is nothing but a big bag o'clichÃ©s the only thing out of the ordinary is the on screen slaying of a two year old boy which was pretty sick otherwise it's business as usual for this genre e g involves lots of car chases beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing i could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare a ed inmates though also did they run out of money before filming the last scenes i mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure if anyone knows give me a bell actually don't bother br br to conclude file under forgettable nonsense next
<START> it's all very simple jake goes to prison and spends five years with the con and the chess masters they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears from what he believes to be himself for that they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear all the pride all the hope to be reborn as true master of his will br br it's a clever movie about the journey of illumination about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves 10 10 no doubt
<START> everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies
<START> the hanson brothers andy apparently has his act together and hank clearly doesn't have his act together need money andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson family br br this film delivers this is a layered full blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing as a crime drama thriller i would happily compare it to 'no country for old men ' while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills 'devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace 'no country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while 'devil' is a bit more enjoyable there is definitely less violence in 'devil' than 'no country ' the acting delivers as well ethan hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deer in the headlights look to the besieged hank philip seymour hoffman as andy has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything br br there's really not much wrong with this film it jumps back and forth without being confusing events spiral out of control but the film never does the writing from first timer kelly masterson directing veteran sidney lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum in many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like 'the departed' and 'no country' squeezed this one out of the limelight if you liked those you'll like this
<START> you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster the question is not how did it get made because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film they will do so br br no the question is why oh why did steve martin allow it to be made i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful that out of pride he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income br br the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family br br and dcreasy2001 aka mark blankfield it's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment i was praying for you to veer over into satire but alas you were really making an effort at spin why not 10 stars
<START> a schizophrenic has escaped from a nyc mental hospital and soon teachers start getting offed at st trinity university new teacher julie francine forbes has to deal with the mess of red herrings despite a 78 minute running time this cheap o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such director richard haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk n slash staging but delivers the grue the early 80s audience was probably craving for all of our amateur anthropologists out there this was filmed in new yawk in early 80s so you can check out all of the culture beliefs and practices of living people from that far away place the film does get some credit for offing the final girl you rarely see that also always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer doth thou not trust the clergy my beloved film industry thankfully this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught he is still working the moral high ground angle though
<START> i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water br br holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective it is amazing the sound mixing camera angles directing and acting are all spot on br br additionally the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non exploitative it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend br br i've had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals once in the us and once in netherlands i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved just listening to conversations after the screening people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation br br i highly recommend it to everyone both for its cinematic value and its subject matter
<START> everyone has a first love and though it is hard to define that feeling when you're younger it is there aching inside you that is what malaysian filmmaker yasmin ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple straightforward fashion br br such an approach is especially convenient in this case as the love story at the film's core involves two twelve year olds and would therefore make any attempts at deeper analysis seem contrived and pretentious that they don't is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non actors sharifah aryana and mohd syafie naswip the former plays orked already seen as an adult character in ahmad's previous picture gubra a lively almost rebellious girl who perhaps influenced by her british upbringing her mother studied in england despises playing with dolls preferring to play violent sports with the boys then one day she meets mukhsin naswip who has come to spend the holidays at his aunt's house and all of a sudden she changes her habits goodbye fistfights hello bike riding and tree climbing but what does this mean are they just friends or is something more implied something neither of them is yet ready to understand let alone accept br br given the young age of the protagonists answering those questions borders on impossible and so like in several smaller films lost in translation comes to mind there is no real closure a choice that leaves a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying aftertaste the naturalistic unfiltered acting especially aryana's gets to the heart almost immediately and a strong supporting cast orked's family most of all helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing the down to earth approach isn't always that effective the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early and it is hard to justify the bizarre pulp fiction reference at the start of the feature but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent asian cinema
