<START> peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation there's no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isn't the cast is terrific in every way a classic
<START> all the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish with the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke br br this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead br br 0 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen in years you could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film absolute waste of time watching it i only gave it a 2 as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish the acting and i use that term very loosely is abysmal someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film don't waste your time watching this hostel was a better film by some way i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this i hope for the producers sake it only cost 50 000 to make it looks like a school project made by kids who haven't got a clue did this even make it to the cinema
<START> i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds as a matter of fact they didn't at least so its seems some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie that's it this is what the majority of viewers think however the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian portuguese title of this movie means voyage into death this is the spoiler br br that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat on reasons that are completely unclear you understand only in the last 5 minutes when you start the movie with the english title haunted boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ghosts but in reality this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality it is told from the perspective of the young girl we see her not alone but together with the four friends because she sees them we do not see that she is alone so the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture stream but the main story we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat br br i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the movie makers cheated an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film student elaborate with hastily chosen pseudo actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers how mistaken can one be but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat when she has recovered from her shock she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends and there they are again they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore she jumps into the water arrives at the boat and they are away miraculously beautiful it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer when i awoke i saw death standing at my bed but i closed my eyes when i opened them again he was gone
<START> this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller i've ever seen oh where to start br br plot what little there is clayton beresford jr hayden christensen a young billionaire with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's pa samantha played by jessica alba on the night that these two secretly get married it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found go and figure the odds of that one once on the operating table clay finds out the anesthesia isn't working and he can feel everything and hear everything br br fortunately clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of samantha which we are told he's doing through an annoying voice over which never seems to stop br br if you didn't burst out in laughter yet you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes br br how could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon one nurse an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist there were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled not to mention the medical behavior which is too preposterous to be taken seriously the operating room isn't even kept sterile people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up during the operation the viewer gets to hear clay's thoughts none of which are too fascinating ah but here's what it's all about the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money believing him to be unconscious the villains speak freely gosh what will happen br br well at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery not even clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status the only one interested in keeping updated is samantha but oh no could sweet sam be in on it you'll quickly find out through some scooby doo dialog br br in the end it wouldn't even matter whether or not clay underwent anesthesia awareness because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases br br if you can ignore the feeling that the director writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness maybe there's some dumb fun to be had br br enjoy
<START> corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie in a coreen drama such as this secret sunshine you'll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times there's not only tragedy in life there's also tragic comedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by song kang ho summing up the mixture of the picture but don't get me wrong this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators that doesn't mean that it lacks unity on the contrary it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain br br shin ae who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband really gives by all the different faces of suffering she's going through unity to this movie it's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through denial lost anger faith pert of reality the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience br br the only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical interludes and to let the artifices of the movie touch you i must say that some parts of the movie really did move me especialy in the beginning particularly those concerning the unability of chang joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing this kind of scenes makes secret sunshine the melo equivalent of the host for horror movies or memories of murder for thrillers these movies are indeed surprising most original aesthetically incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with the only thing that secret sunshine forgets as the host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film
<START> often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a slob sportswriter who decide to live together to cut down on expenses br br nicely photographed and directed the script is very barbed that is there's always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters evans and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes ex wife to be he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinks br br very entertaining
<START> it is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh athon strange comes to mind again and again shot amateurishly acted even worse and the directions maybe none the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit see it if you got time to kill but don't don't even try to take it seriously supposed to be a tribute to 'porno holocaust ' since i haven't seen it from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad should have given it 1 10 but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a 3 excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on stay away if you are squeamish more gore than laughs wonder if the makers had a laugh making it
<START> this film is not funny it is not entertaining it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory it's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like this movie is boring obnoxiously mind numbing and at times offensive and disgusting at most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time
<START> i was intrigued to see how a little seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see the hurt locker sadly all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off the screen reasons br br the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see when it's not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire annoying shaky cam visuals it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing br br the plot is threadbare the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected beetle bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue on the instances where the film gives up on being minimalist and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes is some of the worst ever recorded in fairness the actors do the best they can in the circumstances just not enough to obscure how bad the project is br br the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of mockumentary that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama br br if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life
<START> this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it's also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too 8 out of 10
<START> the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just don't get it and i don't understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the movie br br possible spoilers be forewarned br br his is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that description br br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well it's stunning br br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully done br br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end br br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it it was a treat and a joy to watch br br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces br br
<START> this movie could have been great cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this godawfull piece of danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border i'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie this movie is the reason why i chose to register here i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
<START> thomas capano was not anne marie's boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann rule's book and saw the city confidential segment on a e tom capano was a megalomanic sp an uber controller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think it's a waste of money that he is still alive
<START> i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world but this poor excuse for a soft core porno flick is needlessly offensive lacks anything resembling wit and serves merely as a vehicle of self promotion for springer even though it runs a quick 90 minutes the film drags hideously and i should have had the common sense to walk out simply atrocious
<START> the sensuous nurse 1975 was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula andress man was she hot in this movie she was stacked and built like a brick house ursula was smoking hot in this movie i have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before br br ms andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots one night the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed t l c to her ancient client the old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family what kind of job did the family hire her out to do will the geezer fall for her car giver how can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family to find out you need to find a copy of the sensuous nurse italian but badly dubbed into english br br highly recommended
<START> now isn't it considering all the good work done by danzel clive and jodie the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die hard heist movies copycat yes a couple of jokes no absolutely no unpredictable twists to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us if someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe who the hell is the rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell it could just make my day but it seems that spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy
<START> how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not 'house bunny' did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a clichÃ© from beginning to end clichÃ©s can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use clichÃ© after clichÃ© rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting persona's of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding
<START> when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of showgirls but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de vierde man this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing and above all the story is absolutely plausible which makes the whole experience even more intense the performances by jeroen krabbe renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional and verhoeven's direction does the rest de vierde man makes even basic instinct look quite tame it can't get much better than this a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema 10 out of 10 at least
<START> once in the life means that once a hoodlum always a hoodlum and nobody gets in or out of the life' for free neighborhood hoodlums in new york sell drugs and run scams because they can't make it in the legitimate world maybe because they have a criminal record or a drug habit or because they're just lazy this simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other the film is written produced and directed by laurence fishburne who also stars as 20 20 mike all hoodlums have nicknames and is based on his play riff raff ' it feels like a play from beginning to end especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted often times the dialog comes very fast much faster than it would on stage and i think it's the film's biggest flaw mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street a sort of iambic pentameter rap that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses the poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men these hoodlums who murder cheat and betray each other as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt the disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all one is too stupid another a junkie and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders or even laughs at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise
