<START> i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn't help myself i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g b which is unique among allen's work along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop's most enjoyable aspect the plot revolves around johanson's character a journalism student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she falls in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen br br i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson's performance but i am a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character she adds appropriate body language for comic effect needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus br br allen is allen he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late br br jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less br br in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen are more detective like than anything however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners i did find his allusions to his last film interesting come for the humor laugh and be merry br br needless to say if you enjoy allen's work watch it if not watch something else
<START> i saw this movie a million years 5 years to be exact ago for the first the time in the light of recent events with the australian woman schapelle corby being imprisoned in indonesia for so called smuggling pot i decided to watch this movie again i excepted to cry my heart out 'cause i'm sucker for hot girls in need just read my review of 'the stalking of laurie show' some moist escaped my eyes but it were hardly buckets filled with tears why not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions why then why did i not cry i wanted to cry when i rent a movie like this i except to be moved to sob like there's no tomorrow to feel miserable and like it this movie was simply too short to do this it was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside clare danes and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing and oppressing surroundings the mental journey is missing here for some reason you only get to see the key moments of it which are very touching i admit probably because of bad editing sometimes i felt these girls were walking around in a postcard the relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention what's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents especially between alice and her dad you catch a glimpse of it but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture sadly enough br br nonetheless this was a great movie and at the end i even had to bite my lip a bit but i guess this has more to do with the acting skills and the looks of the actresses and the music then with the merit of the director to be honest i hardly knew who kate beckinsale was before i watched this movie again now i am a fan great movie as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema
<START> i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films i've ever seen although visually fascinating e g the use of colour was absolutely stunning it was pretty boring and disturbing see the father son incest br br what's more music is totally absent and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by michael nyman who wrote the soundtracks for most of greenaway's films then you can imagine what a difference it makes br br
<START> i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules
<START> i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film was vh 1 treading on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me it's far from the exploitation film i expected instead it's a character study a low key whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn it's hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by
<START> i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1 a sam peckinpah movie 2 featured steve mcqueen ben johnson and slim pickens 3 was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time br br by comparison the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife kim basinger mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie br br let's just get it said and out of the way alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role like someone else points out peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action adventure heist genre by contrast baldwin bassinger company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone with only michael madsen's and james woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people br br the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words one viewing was more than enough not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy br br so i don't know this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor actress which in itself isn't a really good thing i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie fall flat with something original this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood thank god for team america for putting him in his place br br 3 10
<START> ever watched it deals so gently and subtly not only with aids which is only alluded and gay life but also with old age dying and death it's a deep and beautiful movie also visually of a very special director highly recommanded1
<START> hardly a masterpiece not so well written beautiful cinematography i think not this movie wasn't too terrible but it wasn't that much better than average the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically because mom says we can't some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters couple times i was wondering if the writer director was a fan of george lucas' classic american graffiti not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that i mean come on worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part i mean double come on she was the only one in one or two lines who actually tried a southern accent take a good listen it was there even though her character was from california doh maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie oh well what can ya do when you have a director who's just a director and not an artist also too bad overall i give this a b and that's being a little generous 'cause i'm partial to ms amick
<START> another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s br br with esther rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord black agent mr bookman as well as prices and the day to day problems of just existing br br the 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter to their daughter who also aspired to attain success this show was a perfect description of african american life
<START> that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years now i'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone un noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels br br the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being hypnotized as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler jean marc barr is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film br br the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean marc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and mise en scene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his no frills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 10 10
<START> for columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular and just how good it really was ruth gordon has a field day as ever playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist abigail mitchell seems abigail calls her nephew in law to sign some papers making him her heir she never got over her niece's death and is convinced her dead niece's husband charles frank did the dirty deed to tell more would be unthinkable mariette hartley has a sly role as abigail's personal assistant this episode of columbo is in a class by itself it's a truly well made television movie i recommend it most highly
<START> i barely remember this show a little but i remembered it was great my eldest brother reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d v d set coming out the network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in it's place it should have gone at least 3 seasons why not right i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world but they mis guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time let it be said that they have a lot more flops than 'hits' this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up anyhow i am getting this for my collection
<START> last weekend i bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the dead br br boy was i wrong br br it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover art which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre br br we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore br br some people actually consider this a so bad it's good movie they are liars i didn't finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through br br this is even worse than zombiez do not watch
<START> brutal emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963 on october 30 1978 he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield illinois he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist donald pleasence who knows just how evil this young man is br br it opens with a bang and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire it's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were subtle and scary it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings how many movies are there really that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before not very many br br pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career jamie lee curtis in her motion picture debut became a bona fide scream queen after acting in halloween as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures and she is an intended victim worth rooting for br br co writer director john carpenter knows what works in this movie making excellent use of shadows and dark skies notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall with this picture he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels many imitators and an upcoming re imagining br br it's very quotable who could ever forget dr loomis' pleasence speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff charles cyphers a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter's earlier works br br it's fantastic and worth seeking out this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time br br it's not totally infallible there are script holes after all but overall it makes a solid impact br br 9 10
<START> ok i didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imagine br br the plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvation we'll move on br br i'll layout the plot w o giving much away the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate he brings with him a mental patient i'm not making this up who shot him during an excorism and who loves him not one lick of this btw is explained a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal they get to rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear s m anti pope that the drunk irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh btw he's a bad guy so he has an industrial techno soundtrack and then umm seriously i'm not sure the plot meanders about heath chills with the sin eater flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the anti pope falls and the film ends br br about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened by the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off scren you're really feeling cheated
<START> paula i may be a bitch but i'll never be a butch br br a hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in stacey walker but that's about all this gal's a real tease who lures her boyfriends co workers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom but then turns into a whack job who cries rape and calls for the police br br the schizophrenic personality of this certified c t is interesting for maybe a little while but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one note affair at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time
<START> vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable however i have watched this movie three times now and believe me it's an awesome movie br br vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage in that sense sooraj r barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well made highly entertaining movie br br several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately br br when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride amrita rao the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene br br the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her i e a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation also amrita's naive nature limited eye contact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions br br the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle alok nath when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter in law rather than her uncle's beloved niece br br clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly br br shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on screen couple without a shadow of doubt other characters alok nath excellent anupam kher brilliant mohan joshi very good br br on the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families the movie has top notch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya it's a must see
<START> the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me i had received an e mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie it was neither great nor inspirational the cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie a lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about the voices were often distorted for no reason also many of the people in the movie were far fetched the relationship he has with his ex son is never made clear also the whole movie has most him one way and then all of a sudden bam he is cured and inspiring people the whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life making him live his life the way that he is living it but when he changes he doesn't leave boxing he teaches others how to box thumbs down
<START> in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays townsend harris a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s before him commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853 harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure compliance as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the title br br my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a diplomat when he's being diplomatic in most films he says please and thank you as he pummels people so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed in fact i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role by the way i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all br br however despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad all in all a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting br br ps read through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and it's also a nice example of john wayne diplomacy
<START> many many spoilers in this review this movie was horrible i am a huge baseball fan so i thought i'd watch it and i was very disappointed it started out okay when i saw the bad influence deniro had on his young son i was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something anyways at the beginning it seemed as if deniro was supposed to be the protagonist he was the only one that believed in bobby and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of which gave me a reason to feel bad for him he wanted to help bobby by talking to primo when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs primo to death not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song i want to you at random unfitting moments br br later when deniro saves bobby's son from drowning i was hoping that the movie could redeem itself he could forgive himself for killing primo if he saved bobby's son but of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie because all he cares about is getting credit for the murder and does so by stealing bobby's son car and dog and holding them hostage bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that deniro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knife br br now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end it is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called then deniro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls bobby out at home proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field there are seemingly no officers on the field but the police are on their way so deniro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to bobby when he gets shot to death but don't worry this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending because bobby find his son br br this is not a sports movie it is not about a fan as far as i know fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten rob and throw knives at their admirees this is likely to be the sickest movie i will ever see in my life the plot was shallow the soundtrack sucked the movie had no purpose whatsoever i warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film
