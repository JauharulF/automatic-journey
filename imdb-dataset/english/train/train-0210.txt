<START> i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are amazing there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
<START> i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are i don't know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it's time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk i don't think it should be remade and bastardised like i said it's a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without mini's and michael caine i give it 10 10
<START> trudy lintz rene russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children they dressed in clothes and had many amenities one day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life once out of danger trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children this works well for years and buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home but buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous will trudy be able to keep buddy under control for those who love animals buddy is a must see movie based on a true story trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore of course buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice the costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding but most importantly animals are here in abundance not only buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice all animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over buddy
<START> i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter br br steven is steven with an ever changing voice and totally unbelievable in his role as always who the hell lets people with bad nappy hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior the supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark btw did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting br br this is truly abominable in every way possible invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it this one's truly special
<START> spoiler i love branagh love helena bonham carter loved them together in mary shelley's frankenstein but this br br i can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really the script droned on bonham carter's clothes were tres chic and the occasional speeded up madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie or the old rowan and martin laugh in br br i never got the point other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusing br br bonham carter's realistic one supposes attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in full monty br br the poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrack br br go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it donate this to pbs br br
<START> dear richard i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen but seriously do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant i know that seems ironic but the pay benefits are much more rewarding br br everybody would see you around tim and instantly think tool time you would even get roles with bob vila more often instead you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smiling i know there wasn't much of a script but you could have added to it i mean come on tim owes you one br br but seriously this movie does nothing for the air bud line quite the contrary the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports the original was better and you mr richard karn know that more than anybody br br this is an f movie
<START> first of all yes i'm white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people bad but black people hating white people ok because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neo nazis and win the neo nazi where twice the size and the chase the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesn't deliver this is a racist movie that re affirm all the clichÃ© stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it br br save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie
<START> i have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months being a huge jim carrey fan i easily saw how he could morph himself into seuss' grinch and make the character his own i was not disappointed br br this movie was pure magic carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did there was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come i already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video and i undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as i did the first time i saw it br br clearly this movie has jim carrey written all over it and i do not believe that it would have come together without him however the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right most notably the adorable taylor momsen who was the perfect foil for carrey's antics the set design musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical fabulous finished product and i believe all involved can be proud br br it is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film but howard has succeeded with flying colours for those critics who disagree perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small
<START> although the plot was a bit sappy at times and very rushed at the end as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story overall it was pretty good for the made for backwoods cable tv genre br br however the actress who played the babysitter mariana klaveno was very good i hope to see more of her around in movie land the music was also well done getting every possible chill out of the dah duh dah duh think jaws type music based tension build ups br br i don't think i'd want to watch while the children sleep again but if i did it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno
<START> my comments on this movie have been deleted twice which i find pretty offending since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people please be tolerant of other people's opinion obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood so ill change my comment completely br br i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons br br subject one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker so making a movie about his life which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with or preferably don't do at all wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know one might think this is not a review of the movie itself but the movie is not about an imaginary character it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had has great influence on the world of yesterday today and tomorrow if someone tells a story about a tomato i can express my thoughts about the story itself but also about the chosen subject the tomato there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken br br screenplay one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents why it distracts from what it should be about nietzsche and the truths he found it doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time come on make it proper english or better yet german even mel gibson got that part right letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passion br br secondly it is well over acted br br 3d assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche bad casting br br 4th facts are way off br br and so on its a waste of celluloid
<START> what's wrong with this film many many things the editing tries too hard to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him her with a powerful headache the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film we all know what happens to things when we stretch them right exactly they get thinner in the end the plot is just so paper thin that you might even miss it if you aren't paying attention which is hard to do when watching this movie the acting is not even slightly impressive the characters are poorly written and dull uninteresting one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently whoever was in charge of the score soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was supposed to be about not that i blame him i couldn't figure it out either as a result half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all also what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character naturally this was in order to attract young males but it was just so cheaply done and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film on any conceivable level at all the two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all they were just there in order to have some chase scenes i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea but i digress i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it although that may only be true for the killer cut which i saw 1 10
<START> a brother's promise is a wonderful family film this is a biography of dan jansen a champion olympic speed skater the movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood the love and support of the family members is evident throughout how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us the commitment and determination of dan's coach and his teammates shows what it takes to make a real team how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age
<START> some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most br br i thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't it br br i would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last house br br other than that worth a look
<START> this movie is not a kung fu movie this is a comedy about kung fu and if before making this film sammo hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati i ie e g esp jour de fÃªte he is certainly on the same wave length br br personally i think tati's films are hilarious but they're not to all tastes some have told me that they loathe his work i've never figured out why but i think it's because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan so unaffected by the events around him which he is usually causing that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him br br at any rate tati's main shtick or at least his best known is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios he's a hazard in a car but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle but through it all he never loses his aplomb which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall br br in a similar fashion the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there this gets him into trouble in small ways since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street a cop stops him only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt soaked during an accidental dip in the bay what's interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn't understand what the cop's fuss is all about in a country town as long as no one's looking if you gotta go you gotta go in other words hung is not really urinating in the street but he certainly would and what's the problem officer of course hung's obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant owner uncle of course in a bruce lee movie the thugs would be considered trounced and they would have learned their lesson but in hung's hong kong reality unfortunately prevails and the thugs return when he's not around to trounce his uncle br br of course hung finally triumphs in the end just as tati always did characters like this must always triumph at least in comedy because they are completely innocent and as such despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be we don't really want to be bruce lee who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad guy we in our own innocence really want a world where lee's heroics are possible br br unfortunately that world only exists on film br br ah but what if and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best
<START> titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies it has its problems what movies don't but still it's enjoyable br br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you don't i know so many people who don't like this movie and i'm not saying i don't see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist but this is a movie doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected br br and finally if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie br br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy br br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic br br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed br br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it br br i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events
<START> what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle hackman and russo scheider in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr moreau the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier rey the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny correct me if i'm wrong but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack a street value of 32 million but yeah let's send doyle to find this guy it was his pinch after all please the story was weak the acting was terrible with the lone exception of hackman who completely overplayed his part the direction was all over the place even the cuts between scenes were terrible do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one
<START> i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew it began with great visuals little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall the score though not bad gave the film almost a music video feel it just felt a little dated not adding anything to further the storyline some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece i walk away from this very satisfied i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed great job
<START> this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies which i do that this is not even amusing the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country some strangers appear and the problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from a to b this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens i am really curious how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end
<START> elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community and while it was a very interesting idea in concept in reality it has failed miserably br br the film is beautifully rendered which is probably the only redeeming factor a huge problem with them however is the vast overruse of light bloom it's horrible although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality br br one thing to note is the terrible voice acting while proog's voice actor is at least semi competent emo's voice actor is horrible i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero you can't afford to hire real voice actors to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice br br as a whole the movie doesn't really go anywhere to me it seems like it's more of a look what we can do kind of movie instead of a real film the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas br br overall it may be worth a quick download from the official site but don't expect anything except pretty graphics
<START> warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you're actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to loosen up the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the bitterness is still there and interrupts at times but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of 3000 to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennon's assassination the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other
