<START> i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what a false world this is br br what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself br br a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone br br amitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor aryan gave a good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself br br a great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of nanak singh a punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson giving
<START> father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family of white lions in this case it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italian american flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues drugs prejudice etc is the source of the program's brilliance br br the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote rather than the more logical production order several times the show was preempted for an extra half hour of such dreck as the biggest loser as if 60 minutes of that was not enough it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate br br luckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 10 10
<START> this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you don't want to know much about the plot don't keep reading br br gilbert's character ophelia is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role br br the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love br br the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell br br i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner is far superior not a steele book as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film
<START> small spoiler herein br br when i looked at the votes for creep today i was surprised about so many imdb users rating this movie 1 i am wondering what do people expect of such kind of movie are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it br br creep is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one this automatically means it has a absurd story full of holes outrageous hazards and simple one side characters so why complain about it just take some popcorn and coke make yourself comfortable in your seat and then enjoy to be scared to death the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie br br when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie the second part of the movie is not scary at all but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel so if you want to make yourself a very very scaring hour just watch the first hour of creep and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv you know the rest of the story anyway don't you the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor but even if you watch this movie up to its end you will not be disappointed br br and if you want to push anxiety to the next level do what i did after watching this movie leave the cinema by dark night go to the next subway station and take the last train home
<START> this was a pretty decent movie this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained just a typical hollywood film this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one but i thought it was pretty good it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick i personally think that storyline has been done way too much but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service all in all this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good
<START> i watched 3 4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here it was fairly easy to watch at 3am it had good casting kevin dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable he was both charasmatic and chilling the rest of the main characters weren't so bad either br br this is your typical stalker suspense movie a married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help a sociopathic genetic material donor fixates on the recipients and in typical stalker form intrudes into their lives br br as i said most of the movie was fairly good we see conan grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother of course things don't work out for him the way he planned not a bad plot line br br but the last 15 minutes were just horrible i am pretty tolerant with movies especially at 3am but i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written i actually scoffed outloud br br all in all not the worst movie i've seen but i wouldn't be able to sit through it again unless i skipped the ending the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillon's role one of the best serial killers ever br br try looking around at the other channels before watching this but if nothing better is on i'd give it a try
<START> ouch what a painfully boring sci fi movie and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action packed and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top secret files as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible inhuman events that take place in the lab he's executed figuresÂ from then on the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity threatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five second shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid
<START> yes about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish tom hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in hollywood here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through yes this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios basically an after school type special about the evils of the game dungeons and dragons cleverly retitled here as mazes and monsters apparently the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking drugs having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing no these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain heaven's no not that if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there yes i think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time granted it could be a movie against addiction but there are a lot fewer people who died taking dungeons and dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month
<START> go immediately and rent this movie it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust no one will have touched it in years it may even be a 50 special it's worth ten bucks i swear buy it there aren't very many films than can compare with this the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years yes i gave it a '1 ' but it really deserves much lower 1 10 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind
<START> this film like the first one the man from snowy river has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad outweighs the good br br the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom burlinson is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce rowland did a nice job with the music too br br the bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica sigrid thornton who is a world class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always profane brian dennehy speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord's name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s this film like the first one
<START> just a few words this movie really sucks it's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot it's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii don't waste your time watching this crap even if you like the tremors movies
<START> this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run of the mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time for one it has his old friend paul fix in it fix being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line readings often delivered in these oaters the plot about mistaken identity payroll robbery and murder is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low budget western but wayne's strapping good looks easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable plump balding eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's womanizing partner and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome on the other hand wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman the little mary of the early little rascals fame she is a grown up 20 year old now blonde and cute as a button most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star monogram b's were fairly bland and colorless but mary is perky cute and yes sexy there's a scene in the general store where she works in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps then again as she comes down then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt anyway it's an interesting little b not great but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time the final gunfight isn't handled all that well and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all it's worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman
<START> there are some bad movies out there most of them are rather fun criminally insane 1 was one of those flicks so bad that it was enjoyable and had re watch value to it criminally insane 2 has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me that's saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst but trust me this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long br br the movie has a rather incoherent storyline but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't being fed well you don't see that in this movie except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep br br the camera work in this movie is just atrocious this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15 the sound quality is something else as you can't understand a word most of the characters are saying to give an example of how bad it is go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers that is what this movie sounds like not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood br br now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can't describe just how bad this movie is if you don't believe me see it for yourself 1 10
<START> as others have commented i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year what a gift i then went out to buy it just so that i could loan it out br br best quote dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone cage is on top of his cab when cage peers down he apologizes i'm sorry if i scared you yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage's face with does this look like i'm scared great bit of humor after an exciting and temporary escape br br there really was a sense of fun to this the constant sighting of the welcome to red rock sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake the music created a hunting eerie quality to the film reminiscent of twin peaks unlike twin peaks though it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish needing to top itself br br i admit watching the credits 15 20 times you see they had yoakum's thousand miles from nowhere perfectly chosen playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor with snow capped mountains in the distance this was incredible fluid framing further i've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film also it totally fit the story
<START> i'm ask what a f are whit the real tv never i see some b in my life is a dirty f bad and other a things but anything more is just a piece of american s all time britney saying ''oh s i wanna see his cock i wanna f and stuck his d '' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of s any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s show in this s sill out the money pure sex all f time i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f money
<START> no not the administration of gwb the decider strutter smirker but the mini series monarch cove lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time most of them broadcast between 11 p m friday nights and 1 a m saturday mornings as to why i watched the whole thing i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism br br most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward who turn in the only decent performances jones doesn't make it through the entire series lucky woman ward by the way is aging quite well since her thorn birds days br br the one main thread to the plot who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won't especially care who dun it there is a great deal of steamy sex several murders and all sorts of rude behavior virtually none of which is either interesting or credible most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented the writing and direction is on a par with the cast br br if you stick around to the end the post card is a very minor hoot br br consider yourself warned
<START> what was the purpose of this film i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing even my favorite actor bruce dern couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie a braindead ex pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives he starts out as a fix it man for the woman and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme it was so confusing i can't even write a decent critique if you see this one my sweet make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep
<START> this gripping tale of intergenerational love jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast with a sharper picture and crisper sound my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun the primary actors are ideally cast robson green brings an enigmatic smile a go for broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work francesca annis is one of the most striking 50 ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries as russell baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing reckless but you'll have plenty of fun the sequel a part of the dvd box set provides a wild yet satisfying two hour denouement you won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before
<START> yes this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes then they introduce jinx a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things give it a rest they are there for fun not to become astronauts just yet just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp however you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me probably for a few others as well who else would like to see kate capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature
<START> the only reason i don't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn't quite on par with a movie like manos the hands of fate this movie's greatest crime is the fact that it is head meltingly boring terribly unforgivably british the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising the whole teleporting concept but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers the actors were wooden unemotional and aloof as was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non existent nor did i really understand why the melty faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants else they go rampaging about killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures
