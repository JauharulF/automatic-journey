<START> this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film it's worth a look as it's far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all it's not a reality show i'm wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent br br while some decry the premise i think it's really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think it's the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl br br oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i'd recommend it it's not as strange as twin peaks was but it's got a serious kink to it
<START> where's michael caine when you need him i've seen most of the many seasons of mst3k but this rare pre 1st season flick episdoe k 20 is easily one of the worst movies ever made three stars lee majors chris makepeace and burgess meredith struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness possibly on super 8 makes logan's run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare i can't imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it's unwatchable even with it clearly what's needed in hollywood is some sort of 401k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care with its rights to pollute and drive theme by the end i'm half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech lee i could have forgiven you for this in 1989 but 1981
<START> daddy's girls florence lawrence and dorothy west receive some terrific news at the local post office unaware they are being stalked by burglar charles inslee meanwhile father david miles receives a message from young robert harron which necessitates daddy leaving home so when the young women return they can beÂ home alone as the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening the local grand ball of the black and tans gets underway and a dark skinned drinker portends additional danger for d w griffith's dynamic duoÂ br br mr inslee has one of his better biograph roles stealing the film from the girls and daddy ironically director griffith appears as one of the black faced extras at the black and tans ball biograph girls lawrence and west are suggestive of later griffith girls lillian and dorothy gish especially in orphans of the storm 1921 and they are excessively affectionate in bed the racist tone is unfortunate since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing br br the girls and daddy 2 1 09 d w griffith florence lawrence dorothy west charles inslee
<START> unless somebody enlightens me i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but itÂ´s far from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and thatÂ´s basically all when that agent is played by pacino one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is to one of the best actors in the world al pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year so whatÂ´s going on al
<START> this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title 'zombie nation' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies 'attack' the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy
<START> anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no brainer but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending which is highly emotional keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ted theodore logan in bill and ted the return
<START> this is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a friday the 13th 1980 clone the poster for this movie makes it look like there's going to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddy which is likely to attract movie goers there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie it just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers 1988 on video or dvd and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie br br angela baker pamela springsteen is a camp counselor at camp rolling hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who was once a man who underwent a sex change operation years earlier who knows who cares br br the 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres in which a mad killer goes berserk some have a plot some don't but they're all about as bad as this one sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated that's all this movie is it is just mindless bloody violence br br watching this movie i was reminded of the friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death the filmmakers of sleepaway camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers the world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and it'll kill you it doesn't matter what your dreams or your hopes are it doesn't matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend it doesn't matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are you can forget those plans because you're just going to wind up dead br br and the sickest thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for a sequel well why not they've probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies i missed out on the original sleepaway camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel i will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original and for parents if you know kids who actually like this movie do not let them date your children
<START> the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all time price's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger corman's brilliant poe cycle still the greatest horror cycle of all time michael reeves' witchfinder general 1968 or ubaldo ragona's the last man on earth 1964 marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax 1953 marking his rise to stardom the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor this is not to say however that this film isn't an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem br br price stars as don galico aka galico the great an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife eva gabor from him when the boss takes away one of galico's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival the great rinaldi john emery galico snaps and a murderous spree of revenge begins br br don't we love vincent price when he's out for revenge some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes 1971 or theater of blood 1973 were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan another must see for my fellow price fans
<START> the story concerns a genealogy researcher mel harris who is hired by her estee lauder like cosmetic queen aunt her aunt by marriage we are left to presume is trying to track down her long lost family in europe all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box the researcher heads to europe and conducts her search in places like milan budapest and vienna the scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location unlike a murder she wrote where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far flung locale and lansbury never left burbank anyway she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys the dialogue particularly the romantic dialogue is terrible i watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that i stayed on just to see if it would get worse it did acting was also off i can see why mel harris's career never really took off after thirtysomething but she is adequate seems too old for her co star though but the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse i also lost count of how many times they say budapest to each other yes it is pronounced bood a phesht we know okay i realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those harlequin movies and sure enough it is guess that says it all
<START> isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face and these are a pleasure to see huppert is not an animated actor she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile br br other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self mutilation sado masochism and bizarre behavior la pianiste might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it br br buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth people who compete at the very highest level musically athletically whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment br br not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson br br
<START> the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat trader's story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent
<START> i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn't the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isn't the least funny set of sketch comedy i've ever seen it'll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel ridden this waste of 75 minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver nice if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief
<START> i can't believe the likes of guillermo del toro and kim bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage the script is so poorly written and the directing so weak both by the same person that its hard to find more one dimension characters in a film the dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre the setup it's tricky inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film bassinger's character is so dumb that she actually stops to scream to god where are you so the people after her can follow and then takes a leak and then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world i mean she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her and this happens in the middle of the night it really makes me wonder is that really the best writing people in hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it
<START> yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal
<START> yesterday i saw the movie flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind br br unfortunately it was a couple of years since i've seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man pretty boy cain doesn't do cocky very well the strange deal with the cgi helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some cgi guys to make it but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some cgi program or the producer's son liked to play with his new computer and how did it look awful and when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over looks very cheap br br avoid this movie it is truly awful
<START> i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it it became a weekly ritual every sunday and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special br br the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself br br this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time anthony eden the foreign secretary carl donnitz head of the u boats albert speer pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge hitler's secretary who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed br br if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers br br the opening titles and music are magnificent and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script br br the best documentary series ever made without doubt unmissable
<START> it is a superb swedish film it was the first swedish film i've seen it is simple deep what a great combination br br michael nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown br br frida hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on never give up br br the fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and defends michael's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music br br the only thing that i didn't like was the ending it wasn't that good but it has some deep meaning
<START> a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption that may have just left it all too late visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future subject all interesting sex drugs and violence bring it on i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir
<START> in the tradition of 'carrie' and 'heathers' try a shameless ripoff of not only those two films but 'the evil dead' and 'the shining' as well ' that said they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore and that's a shame 'cause it's a gas br br rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here and although she barely does more than mumble her lines and occasionally scream you're ugly ' into her haunted mirror she's goth way before it's fashionable so you have to respect her and she's quite creative about it too accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray painted hawaiian punch guy hat eat your heart out cher br br karen black overacts a bit but she's not totally without dignity and you can't help but sympathize with her unless you're a certain friend of mine who asked who is that horse lips from 'm a s h' ' the first time she came onscreen br br there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo as the square chick who befriends rainbow ricky paull goldin in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role and william larry darryl and darryl' sanderson as some kind of pet undertaker or something but it's sad to see the once smokin' yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part br br the eighties were the heyday for hilarious mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this and mirror mirror' was one of the last of its kind definitely worth a look
<START> this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves br br the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to do list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mind control helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back on br br maria performs oral sex on a poor man's sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortune br br this movie is empty and will hurt you see it
