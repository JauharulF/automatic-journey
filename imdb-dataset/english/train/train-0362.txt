<START> i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this was br br yuck br br i want my two hours back as i could have done so many more productive things with my time like for instance twiddling my thumbs i see nothing redeeming about this film at all save for the eye candy aspect of it br br 3 10 and that's being generous
<START> i thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies i have ever seen the others being the christmas wife and jack frost all three movies are about death if you like being thoroughly depressed then by all means watch this film or any of the others in this film the acting is good and some of the scenery apart when people are dying is lovely but i am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in despite a happily ever after ending the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another and for some crazy reason i don't want to be depressed when i watch a christmas movie i know this sounds crazy folks after all isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway br br for a more uplifting viewing experience try the forgotten house without a christmas tree george c scott's christmas carol or a christmas story instead unless of course you like being miserable
<START> 'where the sidewalk ends 1950 ' opens appropriately with dana andrews' and gene tierneys' names inscribed on the sidewalk as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate the sidewalk represents respectability integrity and morality Â only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet mark dixon dana andrews was born in the gutter his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb as a police detective dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a mean streak that he can't escape when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised a cheap criminal who'll cheat and lie to cover up his offence br br 'where the sidewalk ends' was the only film to reunite dana andrews gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb 'laura 1944 ' though the two films as far as noir goes couldn't be further apart whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country house murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt it's unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused occupying the typical niche of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in jules dassin's 'the night and the city 1950 ' andrews on the other hand has rarely been better exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadn't expected of him gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role and i think that an actor like richard conte who played mr brown in 'the big combo 1955 ' would have better suited the character i hadn't realised this but conte appeared just one year earlier in preminger's 'whirlpool 1949 ' br br the tension as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting Â certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era Â though i feel that the situation still wasn't exploited to its full potential the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs had the witness been brought in as dixon was re enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks and why for that matter couldn't the taxi driver's testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor tom tully from suspicion of murder niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking felons andrews' seething and implosive law enforcer tormented by rage and remorse has rarely been done better at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas ray's 'on dangerous ground 1952 '
<START> i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals whatever the case i'm sure i loved it from the wonderfully twisted lurid intertwining stories to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone to the vivid gaudy colour with which it's all captured this is high class trash and it's great fun not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so i'd be lying if i said that the film's sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it but there's some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional or was it comedy and i really really dug that i could really get into this melodrama stuff
<START> an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrix br br but it's not only the same lame film as art speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes it ego super ego anal phase sexual insufficiency br br it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is cinematographicly speaking yeiks br br to put it in zizek's own words i saw 5 7 on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie maker br br mr zizek what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you two points only and may god have mercy on your soul
<START> today actresses happily gain weight dye their hair dress like slobs and lose their glamor for a role and bette davis was probably the actress who started the trend even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and constance bennett type makeup in films davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside br br her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film of human bondage in which she stars with leslie howard as philip carey davis plays mildred a slutty manipulative greedy low life to howard's masochistic club footed philip he first meets her when she's a waitress and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man alan hale sr in truth mildred is repulsed by philip's club foot on his part philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him he allows mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women kay johnson and frances dee when he gets the gumption to throw her out mildred trashes his apartment and robs him forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings br br of human bondage looks rather stilted today in parts though leslie howard was a wonderful actor and attractive his acting style is of a more formal old school and as a result he tends to date whatever he's in he shines in material like his role opposite davis in it's love i'm after or the petrified forest which call for his kind of technique his dated acting is even more obvious here because davis was forging new ground with a gritty edgy performance that would really make her name if she seems at times over the top she came from the stage and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her contrast this performance with the restraint warmth and gentleness of her henriette in all this and heaven too or the pathos she brought to dark victory she was a true actress and a true artist davis really allows herself to look like holy hell mildred's deterioration is absolutely pathetic as philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades br br an excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film's greatest stars
<START> this 1934 adaptation of somerset maugham's novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on loan so her studio didn't push for her her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards as the heartless waitress who jerks philip a sensitive medical student around and nearly ruins his life davis is way too shrill almost demonic director john cromwell who usually elicited good performances from his actresses was perhaps overwhelmed by this one davis is watchable for sure but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human i imagine the character of millie as quieter less feminine than davis with maybe a touch of the tomboy davis is such a strong immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her which makes philip's attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be br br as philip leslie howard is excellent his wan somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part as say dirk bogarde might have done which gives his work a rare clarity he seems completely in control here as he should be playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand howard was a fine actor too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm which he doesn't use here br br it's been so long since i've read the book i don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey the sexual undercurrents are muted and at times philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity surely not mr maugham's intention thanks to howard's performance philip remains firmly in focus as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational in himself and in others br br overall a very good film a little stilted at times due to its age it evokes london nicely and is well acted for the most part
<START> not very impressed its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film because there is almost no development in the plot everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry the acting seems very poor as well and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television although this is difficult to tell with the female role yuwen as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time br br tian zhuangzhuang's film the 'blue kite' was a far better film but don't be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s unlike the blue kite the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop br br i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial br br if any film fits the description of 'overrated ' this is it i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry
<START> i've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini series planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see 'earth 2007 ' Â a feature length compilation of the same nature footage Â on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times 'earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction br br though the film directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on earth i hear that the original mini series which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i can't remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy br br 'earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator prey interactions though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final hopeless efforts at survival there's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slow motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic mid air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species br br aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale Â tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing high definition time lapse photography throughout a calender year Â the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently 'earth' left me thirsting for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box set for planet earth uplifting and tear jerking awe inspiring and heartrending 'earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007
<START> i've seen the thin man series powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur's chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with powell there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks powell's character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i can't help myself
<START> i remember this series so well it was excellent such strong and compelling characters stylish and sexy and so different to everything else on offer at the time and now i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama traders br br both season 1 and season 2 are available on dvd region 2 in the uk its a treat to watch the series again br br season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes br br unfortunately it seems to have ended after 2 seasons br br this series was a lot of fun br br sometimes you can get it on special at amazon co uk
<START> this is one of the worst b slashers i've ever seen in my life the ending is something you have to see to believe br br the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a santa suit he puts the presents under the tree eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother then harry goes up stairs smashes a snow globe grabs a shard of glass and cuts himself br br then you move on to the present you see harry he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars he has two books one book for good kids and the other for bad kids he writes down everything they do in these books the guy is a creep he also works at the jolly dream toy factory his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house br br when harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids then he travels to a church and kills 4 people then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree the kids catch him but they go back to bed so harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves br br as he is walking towards a house a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him the parent's are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don't get hurt how do they know that harry is the killer sure you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids br br when harry runs off the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him they don't even know that he is the killer when harry reaches his brother's house his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip strangles him he only loses consciousness phillip loads harry back into his van when harry wakes up he takes off br br the ending is something i could not believe once again you'll have to see it to believe it br br one thing that bugged me was the black santa that's right the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man so why did they bring in a black man br br skip this and see silent night deadly night and santa's slay you'll get your money's worth seeing those two films they are better than this pile of garbage i give this movie 1 star out of 10 wish i could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves
<START> the anime that got me hooked on anime br br set in the year 2010 hey that's not too far away now the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem cops with tanks oh the insanity br br the heroes of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy al leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as brenten a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesn't exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it there's also specs the bifocal genius bible quoting god fearing chaplain purple mo hawked mohican and the pot bellied chief who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they're not very well liked by the people br br the villains are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna uni puma in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku the story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book that's very hard to find br br all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you'd better go get quentin tarantino uneven in places but still a lot of fun br br followed by new dominion tank police
<START> this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great p'z to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers it will not disappoint you
<START> a film with very little positive to say for it br br firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama br br besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again i lost count of how many times i had seen that field at night or that bit of cracked earth br br it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre beth has a key to a warehouse of books there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too late br br and on the point of the acre horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary Â and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so br br there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth the best performer in the piece followed by jefferson Â the cop suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on medication br br with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child did he crawl out of the window he's six months old the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene bad plinky plonk horror music fails to add atmosphere br br often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre which is just bad
<START> br br this movie sucks big time it reminded me of the movie resurrection christopher lambert which i also found extremely boring and semana santa is in every way an even poorer movie br br only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is alida valli alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history i loved her maniacal looks in suspiria and inferno dario argento i will not spend more time dealing with this movie i will say another good thing about this movie use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly
<START> eyes of the werewolf 1999 is a really bad movie the premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible i wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop if you really want to find out check out eyes of the werewolf br br not a bad idea for a movie i just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre production before they decided to shoot the movie
<START> a wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way one gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well this is possibly depardieu's best performance certainly his most natural jeanne moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age miou miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges in the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect
<START> this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it i could've understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this i'm a b movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst it's hard to imagine vampires with no fangs the music score is totally out of place the sound effects are just not effective and finally mr savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause he had a not to bad career over all let me know i'f i'm to hard on this one cause when i don't like a movie i tend to forget about it's good side
<START> i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves i e what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions
