<START> this was the first walking tall movie i saw i think in a 2 movie theater along hollywood blvd so i didn't have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker i remember being shocked at the corrupted system of mcnairy county and the brutality of the redneck gangs i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide and went out to do something about it courageous i thought so to a point where it sent shivers up my spine br br i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest i was pretty blown away about it and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero anti hero genre which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the the punisher but even more so because it's a true story the recent remake starring the rock just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of buford pusser br br a classic that i'm sure will resurface again in the future
<START> this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident
<START> if there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 this would be it 'house of the dead' redefines the term bad movie other bad movies such as 'when a stranger calls' or 'premonition' will actually look much better when compared to 'house of the dead' the basic plot of house of the dead is a group of twenty somethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century when they get there they only find some tents a bar a stage and some bloody t shirts they decide to stay anyway and they are soon attacked by zombies br br there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie it is not entertaining instead it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is the acting is unbelievably bad in a dvd interview one of the actors claimed that uwe boll the director is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene this is a blatant lie the script appears to have been written by an 11 year old who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line it smells like someone farted out here the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie somewhere along the way the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head br br the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing there is something wrong with uwe boll boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing worse yet boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie quite often and at the most random times you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot it makes no sense no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes a la 'the matrix' unfortunately he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'house of the dead' br br 'house of the dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game in fact it has very little to do with the video game it also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good' it does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful' this movie just plain sucks uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set even his presence will curse a production to all the directors out there whenever one of your movies gets a bad review all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'house of the dead' and you will feel much better i will never get those 90 minutes of my life back to sum it up words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is everyone involved in the production of this film especially uwe boll should be ashamed of themselves although what i have said may make 'house of the dead' sound funny it really isn't nothing about it is funny avoid this at all costs
<START> i just watched this movie in high definition on television i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities br br at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things he was a great man but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching that i found it insulting br br first of all they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability sure they were competent actors but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches appearing to have only one leg but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful what they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am br br figure that out
<START> beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouri's book forbidden love and that was a best seller an onion peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in editorialised reality tv br br cleverly edited and colourful broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke i disagree with variety that it's overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just recorded testimonials on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired so i watched it twice br br this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri's friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat no nonsense colloquialisms i think it's a load of sh t personally br br we need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie br br there's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration br br since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she absconded supposedly because a she's either terrified of her sly more italian sounding than greek husband or b because she needed her passport visas to clear her name br br unlikely br br a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 br br i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counter derision and catcalls earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take khouri's evolving contradictions br br the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice br br anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr old with rather disarming charm and surprisingly worked out biceps br br gradually we're introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri's honour killing accusations hook line and sinker later we see their more rueful reactions quite self controlled and matter of fact if some perhaps a little bitter br br it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri's fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change honour killings do happen in jordan it's just their prevalence that's at odds with khouri's book plus 72 other facts in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections br br the publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes br br later still we're shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri's bio as well for one thing she's not only not a 35yr old virgin her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers sometimes she's just too fast talking in her american accent she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don't need any western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to khouri's facts you've got to start questioning your source br br at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman where one fact after another falls eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story and it's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it khouri's american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he's an actor we never find out how anna uncovered it br br so this becomes the filmmaker's triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment her on camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt fbi documents and khouri's most shocking initial crime br br anna broinowski watch list her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players cross commenting on footage to kill two birds making her audiences want to drink from the same well again br br in fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me re confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri investigation br br broinowski made me look 10 10
<START> br br robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it
<START> snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded it's nothing like snl it's just a stupid piece of crap br br andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny br br only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool part br br they could have made the quiet place a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes br br the part where he's pronouncing his h's more is retarded they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie br br this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy which is about half the united states
<START> an annoying experience improvised dialogue handheld cameras for no effect directionless plot contrived romance ick to the whole mess ron silver was the only real actor gretta sacchi was terrible henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more
<START> this third darkman was definitely better than the second one but still far worse than the original movie what made this one better than d2 was the fact that the bad guy had been changed and durant was not brought back again furthermore there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the bad guy's family and darkman himself this made my heart soften and i gave this flick as much as 4 10 i e
<START> it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have hesitated in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars br br i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful' well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful' br br michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i didn't fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film br br where do i start directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars make up zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a star br br however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list
<START> so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it we would watch it all the time when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa's magical toys i'm 21 now and i still love this movie some old friends and i recently got together and watched it we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe no violence no bad language just lots of great songs and important lessons
<START> suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage and here he is back to his basics on vivaah as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage a movie you can watch with your entire family around you a movie you will hate watching alone the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie br br shahid amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq shikhar though shikhar was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public a truly shahid amrita film
<START> first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall
<START> probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet not surprising since king himself wrote the screenplay the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house one of the other residents is jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard the other is a path leading to the pet sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway soon enough ellie creed's cat church is found dead luckily this happens while the family with the exception of louis the father is away for thanksgiving jud takes louis to another burial ground beyond the pet sematary where church is to be buried later louis is greeted not so politely by church he's returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in maybe he was buried alive maybe not nothing more i can say without ruining the story br br of all the king adaptions i've seen this would be the most terrifying the characters are real and the situations are normal mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever then of course we have the conclusion easy to determine what's going to happen but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing moments br br overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what you're looking for non horror fans will want to avoid this
<START> yes as the other reviewers have already stated this may not be vintage l h but it's far from being their worst work as at 20th century stupid i mean fox this film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys but it's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny they don't play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor in this film they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today namely job related stress first we would get checked out by a doctor and he would prescribe some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea that's where the surrealness comes in to all of this l h always take a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerate it but never to the point of being incredible except maybe once in awhile this makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused predicaments and attempts at extrication that's what makes stan and ollie universal in their appeal in this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and gracefully slapstick way not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for roach because he wanted to mirror the big studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation big mistake they should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years what the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option watch laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance
<START> wow you guys are way too nice corny corny corny that is how i feel about that film it started well with a good idea a guy edward asner escape from jail dressed as santa a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money the film is like a christmas version of whistle down the wind the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously for example you get the scrooge type character called sumner rene auberjonois who's a total douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he don't even buy him decent clothes the poor kid wears jeans with holes in it but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hug yep that is how corny it is i'm all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie but this one is way too over the top for me it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just don't match with the rest of it it's not totally bad there are some solid acting especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around
<START> slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning caroline munro has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen simon scuddamore into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower while doing so carol's gang of friends come in give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool's day joke the school's sports coach marc smith saves marty punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand marty is caught in an explosion has nitric acid splashed over his face years later the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back has revenge on his mind br br originally shot under the title april fool's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool's day 1986 made the same year this american english co production is unusual in that it has three credited writers directors george dugdale mark ezra peter litten after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean claude van damme flick kickboxer 1989 i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick it doesn't try to be anything else it just accepts the genres rules short comings trappings plays up to them basically it delivers what it promises a homicidal killer blood boobs babes i thought the character's were alright the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another some of the situations character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining br br despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good i liked the look of the film a lot the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location looked good the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough is professionally made there is some good gore here including burnt bodies people melted with acid impalings stomach explosions axes in faces death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain the special effects are also better than one would expect i was both impressed pleased with the higher than expected body count br br technically the film is better than i had expected beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th 1980 it's sequels anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm one of our nations top rated soap operas in which he plays terry woods while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer talk about typecasting you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces 1982 which he also produced behind him in his office br br slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot did you see that i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level i'm sure the predictable plot lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it make of that what you want make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this
<START> i'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler but i'm playing it safe so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie br br i adore this movie and so does everyone i work with and that is the point i spent a large part of my working life in cinema without being an actor such people are the sung heroes of this movie the gaffers the pullers the on air directors the lighters and writers the costume people etc etc and the whole thing is told from their point of view at least to a great extent most actors are nuts and self absorbed to the point of absurdity which is what this movie spoofs so well but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real life drama possible spoiler alert in one great scene the two leads both actors are discussing how to discuss something personal something entirely 'out of script' with another actor and they start making up lines rehearsing them and critiquing each other's performance br br since this movie appeared in what was it '91 it has become fashionable to do this especially on tv but hardly anyone has done it so well
<START> kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional check it out
<START> a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize 99 of the scifi channel's movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platt's bad writing and directing br br another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there this movie doesn't it's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platt's vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle br br this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn't afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that br br if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because she's ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing q back in st tng so that's nothing new br br in all i gave this movie a 4 10 rating
