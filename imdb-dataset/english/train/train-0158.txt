<START> not one of the better pokemon movies br br two legendary pokemon come into the story you do get to see how strong celebi can be though he turns evil first br br suicune also makes an appearance he didn't seem that powerful br br the marauder didn't have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better br br ash and pikachu meet the much younger professor oak though they don't realise it misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close i saw this in the credits br br don't expect much here the worst of the series so far
<START> practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play evel knieval than hamilton is anthony perkins yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal and as producer of the film he wasn't likely to be fired or told he wasn't right for the part the early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white leather star spangled gear spouting the world according to knieval as if to say don't worry this film is about my youth but i'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture hamilton is preparing for a huge jump yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife lyon both supports and derides him he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity this flip flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters hamilton usually a suave and debonair persona does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject's mannerisms and demeanor including his walk his hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking he even pays minor tribute to knieval's many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in scars from the multitudinous accidents facially he looks nothing like the real cyclist but he does suggest him in his physical performance lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife though her 3 pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea bitten sideshow barker the film was made on a low budget but the story is a rather low rent one anyway so that doesn't affect it too badly the makers wisely used actual butte montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance several of hamilton's antics are amusing though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people's property some of the real knieval's completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage one of which features a mind boggling splatter in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll hamilton's then wife stewart appears briefly as a nurse
<START> soiler it's fake the whole thing is a fake there is no ghosts or zombies alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby doo to drive alan to commit suicide most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them he's not even killing them he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace if he looked at the so called ghost of evelyn he could tell she was wearing gloves my god what a waste of time don't bother watching it renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet sell it quickly do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave i give this stinker the crap o lantern
<START> when i looked at this years wrestlemania's match card i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement br br it starts and it ends br br i'm sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back i mean you watch wrestlemania 22 one of my favorites which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out that very moment of hbk losing to john cena john cena is such a loser poser it almost ruined wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat triple h i couldn't watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania 23 i'm starting to watch it again luckily i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania 24 the greatest i have ever seen which was a pure classic wrestlemania it definitely made up for 'mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well br br if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one like the ones that turn you into fans wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan please don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind and if you do watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch wrestlemania 24 it is absolutely classic
<START> paul grace hartman are my husbands grandparents they were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work i have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one
<START> in today's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days duvall's performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a close up personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing
<START> this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen basically it is right above leprachaun 5 the only difference is that it missing ice t the scene where he does the chick with the carrott priceless oh yeah they made a second one genius
<START> i would not have known about this film if not for its surprise oscar nomination for best animated feature film thankfully it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure br br the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells the main pre occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings one day aiden the renowned illustrator from iona sought refuge with them aiden opens brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world along the way brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration br br the secret of kells is unlike most of the animation released these days it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of kung fu panda however it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting br br try to catch this quiet gem of a film it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as monsters vs aliens and the like the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film ok the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells
<START> nice character development in a pretty cool milieu being a male i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have it didn't try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people
<START> how she moves springs to life only when its high energy talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera otherwise this stale strive suffer and succeed story is low on energy low on originality and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other likeminded films that have come before it br br rutina wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step dance competitions but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction as noted earlier the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting
<START> may contain spoilers br br the titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next from a moth eaten dime store mummy and nasty nazis out to what else build a fourth reich misty's costume like those of some other wimmen gets skimpier as the movie rolls on the last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action this footage actually gets real boring real fast which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it misty gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft core sex this makes mummy raider a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like stan borden david f friedman and harry novak just think if this wonder work had been cranked out four decades ago it would have played for years on 42nd street along with wham bam thank you spaceman and kiss me quick as it is misty mundae mummy raider went straight to home video grab yours quick before it goes out of print
<START> as a big fan of david mamet's films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized identity is totally reevaluated and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his oaths taken as a cop the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting and the cop's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least 3 out of 10
<START> this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of hamlet to ever reach the screen branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket having fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of monty python and the holy grail when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco who shouts the very un shakespearean cry of ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack before being gunned down and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney's bottom and mary pickford's kate br br branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelia's relationship treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window br br the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of kenneth branagh this is never so apparent as in the how all occasions inform against me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film at least that's how it feels which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind's i'll never be hungry again this may serve branagh's ego but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater i leaned over to my companion and snickered great moments with mr hamlet branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last when he attempts to out do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch impaling him with a sword branagh's dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off the wall funny br br while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy it is in fact nothing but a star studded display of a once talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism the emperor has no clothes and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control
<START> what the bliep is it with this movie couldn't they fiend a better script all in all a 'nice' movie but it has been done more than once up till the end i thought it was okay but the going back to the past part barf so corny was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear but wow that didn't happen which is good br br i loved big with tom hanks but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he she is older bigger that just is so pasÃ© br br just watch till it comes out on tv don't get me wrong but it ain't all that
<START> if another hitler ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknown br br anyone who reads the accounts of hitler's close companions the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches ditto the overstated anti semitism which was neither a central plank of the early nazis who were primarily anti communist nor uncommon or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitler's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust br br if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions you can ignore fleck lipped ravers life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country i'm afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama's than fred phelps' br br i hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness'
<START> this film surprised me a little i watch a lot of horror sci fi films and this is a straight to video release that caught me off guard a little i believe this is full moon's best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances good movie
<START> director star clint eastwood's sudden impact is an intriguing addition to the dirty harry series a combination of crude film making and genius it's mediocre and silly in parts brilliant and classic in others with compelling gripping pacing there are numerous echoes of the first film here the shoot 'em up make my day scene recalls the do you feel lucky one one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner just to name a few br br harry callahan is still at odds with the higher ups in the department still mean still tough but now he's older and wearier his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice the two things not always being compatible this incompatibility is the underlying theme of the series the first film posed a simple question what about the victim's rights do they outweigh those of the criminal vice versa depends that film's answer was controversial prompting a sequel the highly enjoyable magnum force which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure heartless vigilantism dirty harry like many of clint's other roles is the personification of vengeance the protector of the the defenseless this movie however brings it back to the victim in this case jennifer portrayed by sondra locke who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men and one woman who committed the crime br br without going into a play by play of the whole movie i will say this i mentioned earlier that sudden impact echoes the first film it actually also sprinkles in little references and in jokes from the whole series the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example an intentional prank i believe the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat has our rogue cop hero found a soul mate in this lady vigilante and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series one which i personally as a fan found quite moving that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the dirty harry collection the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film not to knock the dead pool that excellent movie was a relatively light hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan rather than a character defining film like this one br br this movie did well in the theaters audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing and the president himself frequently quoted go ahead make my day
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare 1991 was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act not as an entity or a co star the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere but that doesn't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge no matter how they try to stop him he always comes back for more but this time he finds out a little more about his old life can the kids finally stop freddy for good what is this secret that is buried in freddy's twisted mind to find out you'll have to watch freddy's dead the end was originally filmed in 3 d br br a fitting way to end the franchise freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang lisa zane yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment rosanne tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances a whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes if you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one br br i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans
<START> guys and dolls is a unique play based on the characters sky masterson br br marlon brando is a high class gambler who takes up a bet with nathan detroit frank sinatra for one thousand dollars nathan needs the money so he can br br run his usual crap game and make a fortune the bet was that sky wouldn't be able to take just any girl to havana cuba and the doll he chose was sarah br br brown jean simmons who was in charge of a missionary sky finally bribes br br sarah enough to go to havana with him they end up falling in love with each other but later she accuses him of something he had no part in nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone nathan's 14 year fiancÃ© adelaide vivian blaine disapproves of nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it however when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double br br wedding br br the songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it marlon br br brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it didn't really matter he did a wonderful acting job obviously seeing as it's brando and played his character very well i have seen a few movies with jean simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one she also couldn't br br sing at all however the singing is made up by frank sinatra vivien blaine and stubby kaye vivien blaine and stubby kaye was also in the original br br broadway production of guys and dolls vivien blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect adelaide if you like musical and even if you don't i advise you to watch this
<START> we know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes an idÃ©e reÃ§ue few would challenge friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tongue tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy they ponder the results he mumbles some more she composes another eulogy etc etc br br the dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring
