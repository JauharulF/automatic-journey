<START> after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the u s propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves disappointingly that it's the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whatever her name was being chided by all involved for never shutting up she's clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage's character says don't you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she's a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy
<START> and it falls squarely into the category of awesomely bad ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature and i felt oh so bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up obviously to gauge the audience's reaction what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience and after a serious anime movie i think it was sky blue the audience was in a sombre mood and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles i will bullet point the worst parts br br script the funniest and worst part of this movie it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill thought out aside rubbish but eminently laughable br br animation poorly done and put together if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine i know i can then watch out for the montage where she trasforms from a swedish peasant girl into lady death br br characters so one dimensional its painful there is a brief backstory with side splitting lines of dialogue and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters br br so in a nutshell if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a mystery science theatre 3000 mindset there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it and its not meant to be a comedy do not watch this movie alone it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than new world with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two
<START> sam fuller's excellent pick up on south street is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's cold war influenced low budget noir vehicles with a running length of under 80 minutes pick up on south street is tough gritty explosive and endlessly entertaining br br widmark stars as pickpocket skip mccoy who has already been picked up three times yet mccoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll candy jean peters candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the communist movement and it's her last job for ex boyfriend richard kiley to make the delivery however when widmark lifts it peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about br br it's a tasty set up with widmark's character while not the psycho of kiss of death a real live wire unpredictable and tough yet curiously charming when bogart or mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end bogart or an overly laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap mitchum with widmark you just don't know what you are going to get and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film or handing it over to the police and fighting the commies on the right side of the law and he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet br br peters gets her best role as the moll with a heart of gold candy widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with peters the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushed falls under widmark's spell yet widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around peters hard edged beauty yet lack of over lacquered hollywood glamour lana turner would never have worked well in this role is a major asset to the film candy is not innocent yet she's very vulnerable constantly being passed between and slapped around by men widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from kiley the scene in the hospital with peters and widmark shouldn't work but it does br br thelma ritter is brilliant as stoolie moe well deserving of her oscar nomination ritter's performance like everything else in the film is gritty real and heartbreakingly honest her death scene is stunning fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting fuller loved a good close up and pick up on south street is full of uncomfortable cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard old hollywood really allowed yet stunningly pulls away from ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact the urban locales and unusual confronting camera angles give pick up on south street a bold uncompromisingly modern look br br 10 10
<START> an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on there's absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great it's so real such things could happen in everyone's life and don't forget about acting it's just awesome just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about this picture is a real can't miss
<START> yes it's over the top yes it's a bit clichÃ©d and yes constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show's still fun to watch since it's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gags br br george lopez is funny don't take him seriously and the show's a winner i'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious br br i do have to say that the one big dark bitter spot is benny i hate the character so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don't have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george as the character would stand by such a deplorable person for so long br br even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show now there's a bad sitcom
<START> i rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version i saw as a kid it was not i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was marginal acting poor character development and most of all failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog in this version the dog of flanders is just a cute aside to the movie get the 1959 version
<START> as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed well i don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film but a few may have died of boredom the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look good br br very loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances once installed in his home she is tormented by a half wit gardener a badly executed portrait peacocks and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot and to her credit actress peggy webber screams rather well br br unfortunately her ability to do so is the high point of the film the plot is pretty transparent to say the least and while the cast is actually okay the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself true the thing only runs about sixty eight minutes but it all feels a lot longer add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are br br there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch it is true that the screaming skull has a few howlers but the film drags so much i couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui if it weren't for peggy webber's way with a scream this would be the surefire cure for insomnia give it a miss br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> i have to agree with everyone else that has posted br br i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience br br i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime br br i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action br br also even though this was based on a h game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it
<START> brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature particularly the nature of addiction which still resonate strongly today br br as for the movie eh nothing special the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything making the viewer quite nauseous why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me but maybe he was too busy trying and somehow failing to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately cast actors all in all a weak adaptation your three hours would be better spent reading or re reading the book
<START> just ppv'd this i don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could but i did want to say a few things br br i didn't know which was funnier redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse close wailing that her precious boy whom she and the mr had decided was a drunken loser has been turned into roadkill that the tone deaf ann schmoozed with peggy lee or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie gazing at her younger self br br i never bought danes as the younger redgrave i didn't buy richardson and collette as sisters either if meryl streep's daughter wants to be an actress she better get mama to give her a few lessons i had zero idea why any girl or buddy would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she luc is a retarded slacker on crack and i didn't give a rot about any of them evening gives chick flicks a bad name
<START> one word boring br br the young demi looks good but she's pregnant point for that d the movie is not scary at all br br the first scenes looked little crappy i could render better clouds with my laptop and after effects but that was then and now is now some movies do not get old well this is one of them br br not worth renting or buying get something better instead like the exorcist br br next d br br oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor d
<START> i generally don't give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction this film could be voted for as a good film however it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting br br first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film not movie violence i am talking about real violence this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women not that we all don't have some real twists with women respectively men but the conclusion of the film ruins it all br br spoiler our heroine finally dies by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex of course it is the director who kills the women heroine women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality that seems to be the final conclusion end spoiler br br well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself but to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women thats just not enough i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach but to me this film is just totally marred
<START> this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only film they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make just based on the initial concept br br the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them she simply couldn't hurt a flea this doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways period br br the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him and that is tough considering i am a die hard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there can't be any other reason cruella's low self esteem servant tim mcinnerny was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get gÃ©rard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mind br br overall you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel
<START> i love movies i love independent efforts and major studio productions i love films with stars and i love those featuring unknowns i love dramas comedies action adventures science fiction mysteries westerns any genre except horror i love foreign films as well as those in english i love good movies and i even love bad ones because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level except for even cowgirls get the blues br br when i attended a late night showing of cowgirls i joined an audience of around 10 less than halfway into it i alone remained soon not even i could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes and i left as well to this day cowgirls remains the only movie i have ever walked out of br br i don't quite know how to describe this incoherent vacuous trashy meaningless film or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time preposterous and inexcusable on every level it tries to be clever but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic it tries to be funny but its humor is coarse and cringe worthy this is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos by depicting protagonists in so off putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values if you want to watch a movie watch waterworld ishtar anything but this except for the new alexander if you're choosing between that and this read a book instead
<START> the immortalizer was uh interesting it certainly didn't kill me during its hour and a half duration but it didn't impress me much either a group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants in a scene featuring cinema's least convincing head crushing sound effect and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs here dr divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again hey this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as freejack who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice with all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum you can almost see visions of from beyond and re animator dancing in the producers' heads but the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off i've never understood why when someone is making a low budget horror film that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore the acting is uniformly terrible with the only good performance coming from clarke lindsley as the assistant dr price he has a nice evil laugh the only other thing of note about the immortalizer is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts seriously most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks
<START> historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because these were free people they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe anna bella and marcel
<START> dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode takes like 4 days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me
<START> doris day never lets a bad script get her down even in the most trying of circumstances day gives 100 and usually comes out unscathed this comedy perhaps inspired by a real life new york city black out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late '50s french play by claude magnier gives doris little to do but spoof her own goody goody image and in the second half be comically sedated which is amusing because of the spin day gives to the situation there are some funny lines here yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the big apple we get stuck in the suburbs doris' co stars patrick o'neal robert morse and terry thomas are not well suited to her and neither is the shapeless hairdo they've got her wearing still it's not terrible it features a few big laughs and for day buffs it's a must see from
<START> i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere well i've never seen it anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance
<START> a stunning film of high quality br br apparently based on true events which as told has the clear ring of truth about it this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving br br an abused and neglected child often becomes wayward in adulthood as one of life's failures be it as a gangster drug addict or burden on society br br antwone fisher as a young adult in the navy is troubled he is on the brink of being a loser he is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play br br in flash backs and therapy the source and remedies to antwones angst are revealed br br outstanding performances from the whole cast the story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment all the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism br br one message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently br br the real antwone deserves success to have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that shows a magnificent character br br and to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded you are all winners 10 out of 10
