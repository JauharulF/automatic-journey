<START> so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that's ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring europe in the process some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant and that's not bad at all
<START> i feel like i've been had the con is on don't fall for it after reading glowing reviews the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews i expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments sadly 'sixteen years of alcohol' doesn't deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clichÃ©d cobweb scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration clichÃ© edits and camera angles br br 'sixteen years of alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland but it's straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice over's the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted the audience doesn't care what happens to them desperate actors do desperate things like this movie to make matters worse the 'homage's' typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters are either utterly clichÃ© or unconvincing the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action br br for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying i still watched the whole damn thing br br i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter cut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes you don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of money so no excuses sometimes i wonder what the actors or their agents were thinking br br pass on this turkey unless you're masochistic or mindless anyway not my thing br br 1 5 10
<START> this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
<START> ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
<START> well when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea how wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad this film ticks all the boxes i've not read the book maybe that's a good thing meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really can't think of any bad points hence scoring it 10 out of 10 and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks by the time william proclaimed 'i can ride my bike dad ' i was sobbing my heart out anyone who's seen it will understand i'm sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended
<START> cinema is dead long live the cinema said peter greenaway one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors at the last year's romanian film festival anonimul which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi's offside i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival's retrospective cinema is dead but still very lively panahi's film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks digitally filmed offside is a story inspired by a real life event happened to panahi's daughter the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match this is forbidden in iran as we are informed what panahi manages to do is to render with few means but with probably a lot of work intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level the absurdity of the laws becomes comical the film has a happy end after all because iran's team goes to the world cup what i appreciated most was the concept the idea behind this film i would be very interested to see panahi's other films that were forbidden in iran as well i guess that he can be thought as an activist director
<START> rip off of scream or especially i know what you did last summer there's some entertainment here and a little scary but they needed some originality br br an entertainment score 6 5 10 overall 5 5 10
<START> watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film and for me the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience it is one of those films that has stayed with me and i continue to ponder and think about it br br surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film making elements which include sidney lumet's comeback movie the time shifting technique deployed in the storytelling the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well the masterly direction the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women the under presented but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance and of course the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts for me the heart of the movie br br phew surely a masterful film so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd only to find no commentary no behind the scenes no interviews no extras br br hey distributors sort it out
<START> this is one of the all time great our gang shorts spanky is at his very cutest and funniest and the babies that he get's left to babysit are also hilarious tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings the opening shot of them all in baby carriages being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag br br spanky's appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless as is his response hey where do you get that stuff i don't take care of no babies the tiny fellow saying remarkable throughout the film all the beautiful sight gags and spanky telling the babies all about tarzan add up to make this one of the best our gang 's you'll ever see
<START> directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten a cuban refugee named tony montana pacino comes to america for the american dream montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami florida this gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch this movie has around 180 f words and is almost three hours long this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored you cheer for the drug lord and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime lords this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed 9 10
<START> this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one the cheap sets the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon and the bad acting it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus however the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box does so at the same time a bank heist is going down at the same fbi agents have been informed of this and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts needless to say the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one however the results do not make for an enticing action film but instead one that has been obviously z grade junk from the beginning of the film perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film what the hell ron perlman was doing in this i have no idea i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it
<START> nominated for the oscar worst script ever in my opinion there's no decent story rediculous acting very lousy humor by every means possible if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie although u can see the actors can act it leaves you dumber after watching it precious braincells are being killed watching this crap br br i warned u br br don't see this movie
<START> i first saw this at a foreign film festival it's a beautifully paced nail biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold it's all shot in a gritty grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully note tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there br br there's a lot of humor and some romance too i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve racking example of its genre i'd put it up against rafifi topkapi and it's miles ahead of the new ocean's 11 though deliberately not as glossy rent or buy it now
<START> i turn on 700 club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made i'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most christians and conservative by most non christians i vote my mind and its usually not rep or dem i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club it bums me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like jesus did please don't judge jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them why are people so mean to each other
<START> it has singing it has drama it has comedy it has a story it's one of the greatest movies ever made period if you can't enjoy this movie then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray in yankee doodle dandy james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award but in this movie he is better this is james cagney at his quisessential best he's fast with the one liners he's fast with his feet it's nonstop action and the song and dance skits are classics especially shanghai lil and the supporting cast is great and the entire movie is upbeat fast moving and exudes confidence and even though this movie was made over 70 years ago it's still watchable even today and of course this movie features miss ruby keeler who was married to al jolson she is the perfect partner for james cagney and dick powell too if you like upbeat fast paced movies with lots of singing and dancing this is the movie to watch
<START> i've seen this about 2 or 3 times and haven't regretted it homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie its unique fun and bursting with adventure the things that make it a fun movie are the animals obvious who are wonderfully trained a very good effort br br 8 5 10
<START> the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes especially cruella's and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella's accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over the top performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice 7 10 bethany cox
<START> just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughable br br but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week br br i have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes that's in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existed br br so well done for at least trying to make a true version
<START> everything in this film is bad the story the acting the effects but its funny funny funny scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious the ''terrorists'' are as scary and realistic as the ''raptors'' this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh the part where the giant t rex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending if your into bad films this is the pot of gold the mona lisa of b b bad
<START> everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there but no paradise would be complete without its snake strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets the father is not a joiner but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles suspenseful and well made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for i have seen this movie quite a few times
