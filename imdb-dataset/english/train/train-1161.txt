<START> delirious near plot less mood piece and if it's more lsd inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made after a startling sm opening which even itself is not what it seems we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or rememberingÂ lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold a rare movie to languish within old jess could make 'em when he tried fine central performances too including the indomitable jack taylor and howard vernon i haven't even mentioned the lisbon locations ah
<START> maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn't have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no climaxes the only climax is shahrukh khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldn't stand this movie even he can't make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you're an art house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it it's not funny it's not interesting it's not catching my recommendation don't watch it
<START> this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time all the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus i could see the two twists at the end coming miles away the great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring and there isn't one character to root for either plus i hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion when john carradine finally shows up at the end it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by bee's as it was rather gory i got this in a dvd horror set called back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky this was included in a set i bought otherwise i would have chucked this out the window this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time and i say avoid it like the plague you don't want to go through the torture the direction is absolutely terrible carl monson does an absolutely terrible job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is just as bad john carradine is good in his scene but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes carradine ruled merry anders overacts here terribly as laura as she didn't convince me at all ivy bethune is ok and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though rest of the cast i didn't pay enough attention too as i had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad overall please avoid this it's not worth the agony bomb out of 5
<START> as it is in heaven spoiler warning br br this was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination br br this is a parable revisiting the life and death of christ daniel is a superior gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and has to give it up when he joins a church choir as its cantor he brings about a transformation in the lives of the choristers just as jesus did to the society in first century palestine they laugh they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other their faults are exposed they accept each other come to love each other become a vital community they include the mentally disabled young man tore such is their inclusiveness br br the pastor stig enjoyed authority through imposing a stifling morality on the congregation and that is gradually rejected by the choristers when stig dismisses daniel there is a revolt and stig is crushed stig represents the jewish authorities of jesus' day whose insistence on obedience to the jewish law provided a stark contrast to the new life by the golden rule brought by jesus br br in one dramatic scene someone declares the church invented sin all through the film there is this contrast between moral ism and vital living being br br true to the christ story daniel is killed by conny when he beats him up leaves him to drown in the river next scene we can hardly believe it when daniel's resurrected body is dragged into his room the tomb draped in a white linen sheet the shroud by three women three women kept vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel br br daniel is drawn closely to lena a warm beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous jesus developed a close relationship with mary magdalene lena who was probably a high class courtesan prostitute through lena daniel learns to love something he has longed for and now finds fulfillment br br the solo sung by gabriella composed by daniel is all about living a full life in contrast to moral correctness that leads to concern about sin and what's right and wrong br br the final scene shows the choir all singing humming in harmony like a mantra drawing in the large audience exemplifying the harmony and inter connectedness that is our true human destiny
<START> i used to love watching sabrina the teenage witch friday nights on abc's tgif i think this was one of the best shows on tgif my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode br br my favorite character was salem he was adorable and sooo funny i liked sabrina's boyfriend harvey too he was hot i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch too my favorite episodes were sabrina through the looking glass and hilda and zelda the teenage years those episodes were great br br overall i really miss this show i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes i give this show 10 10 stars
<START> i like bad movies i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration then there are abhorrent movies like this redline is not just a bad movie but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please for the sake of the viewer at least proofread scripts before funding a movie br br if a stereotype took a crap this movie would spawn from that the storyline is unbearable and the acting all around is laughable nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have perhaps the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for furthermore how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an analogy i am a loyal fan of his but this has made me question him br br to sum it up several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are you're a bigger person than me so much so that it turns to violence i guess the movie is like ouroboros the snake that swallows its own tail in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half and an indecipherable action movie for the rest it should be avoided at any and all costs br br i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll br br p s nadia bjorlin if that was you singing those two songs in this movie then you are a hack and i hope old age ravages you br br p s s if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin's awesome songs
<START> granted this seems like a good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese in a neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and you'll find out br br in truth martin the lead is mis cast he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays a sort of in between character that doesn't work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible cleese is the only even partially funny member br br to top it off the plot is pretty stupid i can't say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they blunder through new york not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who don't live in new york aren't very bright a theme repeated throughout the movie br br in summation instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again
<START> this movie was kind of interesting i had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it i've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it online so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch
<START> what a horrible comedy totally lame the supposed humor was simple and stupid stanly tucci a great actor had the only parts worth chuckling at and he was tied up and gagged at the time don't waste your time with this one it deserves a 0 10
<START> a classy offering from amicus producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell 'the far pavillions' etc turn in a classy intelligent 'four hander' with a strong cast peter cushing christopher lee jon pertwee ingrid pitt etc all giving stylish performances despite a low budget which results in a few 'un special effects' the most outstanding contribution however is that of the 7 year old chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors this underrated release a cut above the run of the mill 'blood 'n' guts' shocker movie is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror
<START> i watch lots of scary movies or at least they try to be and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive i am a fan of julian sans but this is worse than i would hope for him br br on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me especially when we had to turn the video off and that simply is not done with our watching we had to make one exception obviously br br if it were up for a remake i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 of the original incorporated into it that's all
<START> i saw true crime when it was first released back in the mid nineties and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by alicia silverstone a high school senior in a california town who's classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer mary meets tony played by kevin dillon a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer br br many suspects in this one true crime feels very true or real to me i read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true alicia silverstone is perfect in this role and kevin dillon and bill nunn do a great job as do the other actors the locations are right on and the writer director pat verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of mary's loneliness see the scene where mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony i wish verducci would make more movies br br i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime 10 10
<START> utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out why was he still driving a car why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one this question has not occurred to the writers the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife killing blackout driver an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale are police psychologists so easily taken in deadful writing that the actors do their best with but they are doomed to failure this is on a par with a harlequin romance don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for
<START> no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen while the movie is fine and the performances are good the dialogue which works well reading it is crap when spoken or to put it another way no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl br br overall the movie feels like a badly adapted cliffs notes to the book most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book in terms of backstory and current story and the ending is wildly and unpleasantly different from that of the book most of the plots from the book have gotten lost including the one that makes everything make sense at the end and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say huh not a worthy effort unfortunately the script should have been read compared to the book burned and all the actors sent off to do something far better i admire gus van sant tremendously but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries
<START> i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action some said it was too long etc don't listen to them if you like shawshank redemption and or braveheart you will definitely love this movie br br the acting performances are superb tim roth john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life along with shawshank that was virtually flawless from casting directing writing acting etc br br i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop i have seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone has loved it you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site than you will love this movie come on all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at 32 that should show you the age range of most reviewers here br br this is a top 50 movie
<START> david aames is a rich good looking guy who lives in new york city when his 'sleeping partner' julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia she gets david into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with but seeing as he's in love with sofia she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her by driving off a bridge david survives the crash but is left with a disfigured face he is then charged with the murder of julie the thing is david doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams most of which are actually nightmares and flashbacks some of which just don't make sense to him everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth br br well there's an all star cast here including tom cruise penÃ©lope cruz cameron diaz kurt russell jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie in the movie they all put off different things about there characters like happiness sadness angry etc really well there's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant steven spielberg br br vanilla sky is a well made different interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished it's not just a thriller but it's a real psychological thriller the trailer for the movie is really good but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be it's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too all in all an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too they are sure making a lot of are they dead if not who is dead movies recently
<START> every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources br br i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie br br the movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesn't start of like that it begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it but pickup on south street just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch br br i also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really humane it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen br br even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more br br 10 10
<START> i haven't seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about it br br this film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950's what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i don't think i could watch that again once is plenty it's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as well br br some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
<START> two years later bill alex winter and ted keanu reeves are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their instruments in the future bill ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man joss ackland is set to kill bill ted by sending cyborg look likes to destroy them cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill ted now both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future br br directed by peter hewitt tom and huck the borrowers made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects much more funny and entertaining than the original william sadler the shawshank redemption steals the show as the grim reaper br br dvd has an good anamorphic widescreen 1 85 1 transfer and an fine dolby digital 5 1 surround sound dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also believe it or not one of the best sequels ever made depending on your point of view george carlin reprises his role from the original briefly pam grier also appears in a bit role it's a enjoyable fantasy comedy
<START> my god buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godard's movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended
