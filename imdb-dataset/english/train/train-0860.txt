<START> if you ask me the first one was really better one look at sarah m g she is real mean cruel girl look at amy adams she is just little fool hanging around she is nothing people don't adore her second sebastian was cute and hot in first movie now he is baby face story is not that good and i do not understand why didn't they make this one first it is the beginning loosy actors nothing with story this is not cruel this is playing first one has better actors better story and its mean i think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3 it is not the worst movie i saw but in compaer with first one its one big big big nothing
<START> anyone witness to our justice system or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby pamby lily livered melee mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of political correctness br br the performances across the board were compelling i sympathized with the rape victim while at the same found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers in particular i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first
<START> this is the first film of the horrorfest i have watched and after im almost thinking i don't need to see any of the others i was told its a thinking mans horror movie and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think i shutter to think what the splatter gore films in the collection will be like don't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through br br the plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake the camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of the hamiltons i figured out who lenny was about half hour in when i figured out the movie i was so visually under whelmed and confused by the lenny reveal that i completely felt ripped off i expected what i got but they could have gone so much further in fact all the gore falls completely flat with movies out there like hostel and saw you need to come a little better for a film that is considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences
<START> this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions muti billion dollar computer graphics or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese films akira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works 10 10
<START> bugs life is a good film but to me it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff don't get me wrong i liked this movie but it wasn't as good as toy story the film has the visuals the laughs and others that toy story had but the film didn't feel quite as i don't know but i thought it was still a pretty good film br br a bugs life i don't want to say this is a film that i don't remember i saw it years ago of course i haven't seen toy story in years but i still remember it i shouldn't have reviewed this film but i am i am giving it a thumbs up though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done br br a bug's life
<START> the good news is a movie was made drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec american is such a word exists cast the bad news is it was dead at birth br br if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic 'night of the living dead ' this is what we might have come up with 'the legend of diablo' is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of 'mystery science theatre 3000 ' br br i don't think one can even call this a 'b' movie the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8 mm film shot by a group of school kids br br some spoilers br br the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community his daughters one hot and one homely team with a gringo fbi man and a priest to try to re cage the demon br br meanwhile every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re enacted poorly these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead the supposed infrared scenes from the demon's viewpoint are nothing special Â and he she it sure seems to back up a lot as opposed to turning around the moving forward and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast motion is ludicrous it really really appears to be done for comic effect although i know it wasn't i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach br br of course the darth vader field of dreams voice calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical then again so was most of this cheese ball robert napton director and writer of the screenplay should win something for this effort how about a lifetime blackballing like the 'hollywood 10 ' this one i now see is rated 1 5 on a 10 scale i fear this might be a tad generous br br is there anything good about this movie well lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff this is probably why her homely older sister calvi pabon really ran away from home fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent i wonder if mario soto who played father rodriguez is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds if so he should have stuck to baseball in fact they couldn't have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it 'demons in the outfield ' br br if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class i will issue apologies it might be good enough for a b or even b as long as the gang got the college's camcorder back to campus in one piece 'the blair witch project' proved that a cool campy movie could be made on a shoestring 'the legend of diablo ' though didn't appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from it was low budget low talent low everything the very final scene and i mean about the final 10 seconds of the film is the only mildly creative or interesting moment br br i paid 3 45 to rent this i could have better spent it on a hamburger
<START> when an actor has to play the role of an actor fictional or factual the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role in a double life ronald coleman surpassed himself as anthony john the tortured double personality he put into that character all his talent and sincerity the facial expressions mannerisms gait and stance spoke eloquently of what anthony john was going through while playing othello on stage coleman also did extremely well as a shakespearean actor in those short scenes as othello that were part of this gem of a movie closups of coleman's face as othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching add to that his character's off stage desperation and only someone with coleman's depth of acting perception can achieve it was like watching spenser tracy as dr jekyll and mr hyde except this double role was much more profound and poignant shelly winters looked so sweet vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie it is believed that ronald coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the oscar for best actor in 1947 i would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored
<START> i'm giving it only 9 out of 10 because i need to view it again in a more current mind frame to have a fresh perspective what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day probably 1990 or so i might have even recorded it but that recording is long gone i'm sure br br i wrote to greencine to try and get this title in they currently don't carry it i hope i can find it at a local video store br br i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere it's interesting at the very least if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands beetlejuice gummo or anything sort of strange and along those lines try this one out
<START> this is one of those rare movies it's lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup find the magic i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if you're drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish they'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
<START> this movie is one for the ages first i have to say after seeing this once it became one of my all time favorite movies why simple ben coccio writer director has put together a true piece of art where 99 9 of movies these days are purely entertainment director ben coccio gives us truth gives us reality gives us a learning tool to know why this happened the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates while it surely is graphic and horrifying how couldn't it be the gloves come off the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think no sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper are more human we are shown that these boys are us and we them society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real br br respect and love your fellow man a lesson we all should learn thank you so much for making this film mr coccio i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film making career
<START> antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat i don't hate the film but it is missing key elements such as suspense there have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers such as hackers and the net they all fall short the improbable ending of both the net and antirust seem to be nearly identical these movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception people in the pc business having this over indulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it's life waiting to hear the latest news about pc's and software i have worked for many companies and industries and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own self importance as does this film br br the way they introduced plot lines was pathetic showing milo who is deathly allergic to sesame seeds almost ingest one from a restaurant breadbasket crossed the line of stupidity only his 'girlfriend' prevented him from sure death this makes one wonder how milo could have survived as long as he did braving the perils of big mac buns and sesame seed breadsticks as they cloak themselves as well sesame seed breadsticks and big mac buns br br antitrust also doesn't provide much suspense the patterned and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed come on was anyone really stunned when yee jee tso was killed thereby destroying any real shock value and here again we have yet another film story where at the end the bad guys are chasing the good guys to 'get the disk' we need to have a moratorium on this simple simon plot line for about 20 years still i pressed on maybe the ending would be the payoff but no the completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security another supposed evil guy turn around and be the good guy that enables milo to bring down n u r v ceo gary winston was laughable and of course the news coverage of the arrest of gary winston is more fevered than when hinckley or oswald was brought into custody gary winston played by tim robbins is a cardboard cutout of the same character robbins played in arlington road but that fits perfectly here in antitrust which should be called 'anticlimactic' or 'anti original' br br in the years to come this film will likely be banished to be shown only on your local third rate uhf channel
<START> surviving christmas 2004 ben affleck james gandolfini christina applegate catherine o' hara josh zuckerman bill macy jennifer morrison udo kier d mike mitchell dumped by his girlfriend a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone on christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family an obnoxious and one dimensional performance by affleck who mainly acts with a flashy smile makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep but gandolfini and o' hara breathe some life into this mess even for farce its silliness is lumbering not much makes sense from scene to scene and its sentimental messages are as phony as affleck's grin 91 min rated pg 13 Â½
<START> first someone mentioned here that because this was released in limited quantity it means that it should be bad that is exactly what the big five hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can pass or ignore features that are not desirable without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly to the point this production has been released limited because is considered unpatriotic by certain individuals br br now i absolutely loved this feature i find it way better then charlie wilson's war even if it is a fictional account of something that never happens but is always so obvious this goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present american foreign policies home or aboard the turakistan country and the emerald city are definitely trying to resemble iraq and baghdad just as much as the corporation tamerlane goes for haliburton with the vice president dan aykroyd playing dick cheney lol there are quiet a moments actually where the movie is dead serious not even sarcastic anymore main example would be as how john cusack character deals with his depression but not only br br i found that all the characters can be related to something someone or specific stereotypes now word of advise if you are not politically active especially towards the aspects of globalization you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside jokes are targeting certain personalities that are not visibile to the general public on daily bases main exception would be hilary duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star need i say name s at its core the feature is an anti globalization gig period the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance joan has a line at one point that goes like this and here we have a book written by you know who about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dad priceless br br the sister and brother cusacks play good together as always same as in grosse pointeblank i would say a bit more mature marisa tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to impress us like she did recently in before the devil knows you're dead but instead she has a very serious role and manages to pull it off quiet well br br many critics don't get it can not do so or do not want to this is not a regular movie but more of a comic documentary this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars or have visuals sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest hdtv experience tv sets i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re views because is not artistic while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being balanced apparently and engaging makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys br br i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america as i mentioned before it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by special interests groups having the regular american soldier wearing the tamerlane corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is or will be soon the way things go so far br br some priceless shots upon liberation the country gets invaded commercial advertisements a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather news anything is got to be better then this x box bullocks soldiers dealing with their frustration br br overall i do not recommend this to conservatives or hard core patriots of some kind or another this feature is not made to reach to the minds of souls of the people as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so instead it contains a message well defined for realists and towards some ideological goals apparently always short of realizing
<START> i have always said that some plays by their very nature just can't be translated to film and this one is a prime example br br as a play this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not sinned since his last confession so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven br br that's just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works however that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film and it certainly doesn't here br br director marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach br br seek out a production of the stage play instead you won't be disappointed
<START> this is without a doubt the single worst movie ever created there's no arguing here this is it end of story the story is juvenile and sub moronic looking like it was created by a three year old fascinated with dinosaurs the entire concept is just plain dumb it's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining the jokes are also completely lame if you haven't seen this movie yet consider yourself lucky if your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is please don't make me describe it words can't express how completely awful this movie is this isn't just bad as in being a bad movie even those have cohesion if not entertainment value this this is ugh think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5 000 and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is after giving pokemon the movie one point giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity that's how bad it is did the producers and directors even take film classes because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film it looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film if you rented this please take it back and ask for a refund and don't even think about renting it again
<START> how did this become a blockbuster dear god i don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much the movie was predictable there was no originality the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters the movie was too bright they should have done something with the lighting eg making the environment more darker the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick this is 2006 people don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up most of the horror scenes we're taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies total rip off this is why i don't watch tagalog movies the only reason why so many people screamed while watching this movie is because of conformity how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv its now coming from the window next door no matter how you put it its still a rip off if you want a good horror movie go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website
<START> this is a great movie it has a captivating story an awesome main character very good acting and killer action this takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story br br the story is very well done and there are no holes kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives eventually the military introduces newer younger faster and stronger soldiers jason scott lee being one of them as a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like todd they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that russell is alive br br todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on for a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert br br just as russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd todd easily outsmarts them the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee russell obviously comes out on top br br this is one of the best action films i've ever seen and i've seen a lot this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines the writer also didn't forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women sir there are no holes in this film every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining br br an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo commando and missing in action this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action sci fi fans
<START> yes it can be done john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic horror sc fi musical if there is any acting it is terrible or way over the top special effects take your pick very low budget or kindergarten every cheap clichÃ© thought of is used no doubt a fun movie to watch worth a cold six pack or two point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind san diego is a good place as any to start scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace this cult favorite features david miller eric christmas al sklar tom coleman sharon taylor and john qualls
<START> in over 70 years of watching movies this has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made mel brooks mike meyers a few other have made some very bad comedies this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel br br it is unfunny from the very opening to the tacked on scene during the credits br br diane keaton who i normally like must have needed her paycheck badly she desperately needs to re learn her craft br br dax shepard i do not know who he is needs a better director to show him how to act br br liv tyler is also not up to her role br br mike white needs to find another character he has done this same type person a few times too many br br ken howard who started out years back as a first rate actor also not as good as he used to be br br there is nothing decent i can say on this attempt at movie comedy br br ratings out of 4 points 25 out of 100 imdb 1 out of 10
<START> there is an interesting discussion in this movie is being a moral person good enough or do you need something more br br the movie preaches that without the guidance of god being a morally good person is not enough there is a line early in the movie you and i can look at a person who is morally good but both know he is going to go to hell br br while i am not a christian the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating but not in the way the movie intended i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance fanaticism can be a powerful thing especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated as george carlin's character in dogma said hook em while they're young br br the basic premise is a very interesting one also a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok as long as the morality is meaningful do you only tell a child not to steal or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because well how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen br br the author carlisle wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world however it needs unanimous consent and one of the scholars opposes it he brings up in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality's sake vs god's words argument to prove his point he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work which i'm fine with and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead us br br as should be obvious he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees and has reversed himself by the time of his return for he does return that's not really a spoiler this is a bible movie after all br br as for the movie as a movie itself it's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who carlisle is even tho he hasn't hurt anyone committed a crime or anything what's wrong with the movie just showing carlisle's opinion showing his view of this sinful world and returning him with a new viewpoint br br also there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that i'm happy i'm not a christian or at least someone who says it's god or nothing three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me first when the two bad guys corner carlisle right before he jumps carlisle does his only truly despicable act he fakes like his time jump is the coming of jesus and makes it so the bad guys who are also christians btw oddly enough think they just missed the rapture br br secondly after carlisle returns he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning god kid kept the marbles and ran away and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it like the carlin quote above scaring kids into religion is a faux pas in my book br br and lastly the epilogue another scare tactic carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go and he says he doesn't know the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future starts at 2100 and it fails he keeps decrementing the years by 10 and trying again and by the fade out he's at like 2030 or so throughout the movie carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years you would think in these enlightened times the church would have enlightened as well br br i'm glad i saw this movie while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough now i know it for a fact worth watching if you are not a christian to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie
