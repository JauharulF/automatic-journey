<START> like many people here i started out finding my patience being tried by this film by the end i actually shed a few tears br br it seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7 8th length and then catch fire right at the end older film goers learned to bide their time patiently through the slow parts calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way but that isn't quite accurate you see to earlier audiences what are to us the slow parts were the main body of the story they watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there modern audiences post spielberg are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they see older films it's the inflation problem of modern movies well that isn't going to happen it is not necessary to apologize for these films it is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you watch them at this point the difference between avatar and the informer is like the difference between euripides and a traveling production of rent think about it for a minute or two not to strain at the obvious but euripides still deserves a hearing br br the exciting part for most modern viewers begins with the ira tribunal scene and escalates to the final couple of minutes which if you are at all on board or even paying attention by that time will tear your heart out it's not some high tone universal abstract plea for forgiveness it's a plea from one dimwit and those who feel sorry for the big lummox for a little mercy it's that personal and that embarrassingly naked an appeal for after being mad at gypo irritated at him thinking this is the dumbest character of all time you finally find yourself won over by the scene of gypo's erstwhile girlfriend pleading to another woman to talk her man into going easy him br br the film may be sentimental but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged there's a matter of life and death that plays out here and as long as you take the proposition of one life to a customer seriously it's sentimentality wrung out of the most serious stuff br br 8 of 10 and the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours if you are reading this we have all asked for more ever more faster ever faster until we cannot put ourselves in 1935 just yesterday really as easily as we should be able
<START> after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film russ conway i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses in contrast a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep this will help you to sleep that sleep
<START> a long time ago i watched this movie from the middle on cable i then had a crush on mary moronov i saw her again in eating raoul i was convinced that she's the hottest woman on screen br br i maybe biased about this movie 9 out of 10 br br this's the only movie i own on original tape
<START> sammi curr a metal rock god they tried to stop him they tried to ban him the tried to censor his music much like the real life dee snider from twisted sister tipper gore or ozzy osborne killed in a fire sammi cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance now eddie weinbauer his 1 fan and the only one who knew how sammi was and what he felt or did he nuke the d j at the local radio station gene simmons has and gives the only copy of sammi's last record eddie but when eddie tries to play the record backwards he finds sammi talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get back at the bullies at his school that hate him and his music everything works out until sammi starts to kill a great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fans with a great sound track by fastway and just in case you don't know what the songs sound like or know fastway and doesn't like them they changed there voice a bit and there style as well to sound like the more known cinderella or ratt is the movie a true horror movie well that depends on what you call a horror movie to me a true horror movie is a slasher with lots of killing or just plain be scary this movie is neither not enough deaths but it can't be called a action comedy drama suspense or thriller so that is why i would guess it has to be a horror so if you wanna rock n' roll rockin' on the mid night steel your soul than sammi curr and trick or treat is the for you i mean what are you afraid of it's only rock 'n' roll
<START> this is a film that has it all the dashing hero the beautiful damsel in distress the noble figure with the tragic flaw and a truly wonderful robot forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score br br movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role the distinguished and noble looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret id other supporting cast deserve a nod especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful doc and of course the charms of miss francis as noted above br br this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music in the 1950s no less the credits call them tonalities but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the theremin device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track still it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell br br the special effects are also quite arresting i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible id monster and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways guided by the enigmatic dr morbius br br i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters viewers of follow on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes although i recall he never had the personality of the original robby br br i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves through force of will to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed it remains unknown or perhaps deliberately overlooked by dr morbius until pointed out by the clear thinking commander adams who forces dr morbius to confront the evil within himself it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine here here is where your mind was artificially enlarged consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine but your subconscious had been made strong enough zowee br br forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci fi film ever and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen
<START> this is a straight to video movie so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright good br br my kids loved this but that's a given they love anything that's a cartoon the big shock was that i liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tie ins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risquÃ© like in shrek do you think he's compensating for something br br a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noises imagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setup punchline etc and were almost in good taste i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regards br br hmm what else the music was so so not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one br br all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age one that's 100 safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid appropriate than expected but you're safe to leave the room during this one i'd say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too
<START> just kidding this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was so bad though that it was hilarious my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs the plot stunk some of the voices were dubbed the quality was horrendous but i sure had a blast watching it
<START> from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino's name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick 'from dusk till dawn' these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through 'curdled' the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it's becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes it sounds boring and it is br br william baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list and even he doesn't make an impression he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he's pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role not her acting ability she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino's masterpiece but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren't for her latino accent she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level curdled is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels whether you're a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss
<START> i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they don't behave properly in current generation politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills i remember the dialogue from gandhi 'what kind of society we want to create make with such people about harilal ' no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation einstein was right when he said about gandhi that 'after 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind mahatma gandhi had ever lived on this earth ' i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor feroze khan and all film actors actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles
<START> if you cannot enjoy a chick flick stop right now if however you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting read on br br ann grant lord is dying her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined they come to realize that these people from their mother's past are indeed real br br the story shifts basically between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at ann's life between those years it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy br br one of ann's two best friends from college lila is being married ann's other best friend is lila's brother buddy lila and buddy are the children of a rich newport family whereas ann is a cabaret singer living in greenwich village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950's conventions br br soon after ann arrives to be maid of honor at lila's wedding she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three harris he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy also is in love with harris but being 1953 he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic wise cracking bad boy of the family much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents br br needless to say all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy after all this is a chick flick br br in the present time ann's daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationship br br stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years and you get an intriguing look at society its values and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved br br all of the acting in evening is excellent but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes along with two unique family relationships that make this film so very very special br br claire danes plays the 1950's ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do her performance is not easily forgettable br br vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present to the past to flights of fantasy and of course redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style br br natasha richardson redgrave's real daughter plays ann's daughter constance in the film the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch br br toni collette plays ann's other daughter nina nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister collette is perfect for a part such as this but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays br br mamie gummer plays 1950's lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend ann she is very good br br meryl streep gummer's mother plays present day lila what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance br br director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right and close's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is lila's very proper mother and you get another performance to treasure br br there are three other scenes in the film combined with the one featuring close described above that make the whole movie worth watching on lila's wedding day ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lila's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling br br the other memorable scene at least to me is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings his performance is superior br br chick flick yes a very special film with unbelievable acting directing and scenery definitely i cannot recommend evening too much
<START> i'm a nice guy and i like to think of myself as genre tolerant and i guess by that i mean i try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in if nothing else that saves me from feeling like i should be saying really nasty things about people or films which i don't like doing br br the plot in this one was patently obvious the production values very low and sets uhm simplistic the acting rose into good for a high school play territory from time to time my feeling was this was filmed in a day please tell me it was br br worst of all the sex while reasonably plentiful was fairly mundane hampered by at least in my copy a sound over that was inconsistent with the action climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra there was definitely no edge to it at all nothing distinguishing or interesting and with surprisingly quick cuts br br my vote is a 1 then with the following summary statement would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded and the rest of the movie condensed
<START> after a series of power outages on a remote island zoo genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island man the sci fi channel has made some bad original movies but i think this might possibly be their worst so far this badly written and directed jurassic park rip off offers all the usual clichÃ©s mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are expendable losses characters walking down long dark hallways alone brain dead teen characters who's only function in the film is to die a horrible death etc and unsurprisingly no suspense whatsoever the special effects are atrociousÂthe puppet heads in close ups of the title beasties are bad enough looking like stiff plush dolls but the cgiÂwhich makes the computer generated dinosaurs in walking with dinosaurs look life like by comparisonÂare just downright awful there's some gore but most of it looks pretty unconvincing oh and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things i've seen in years i couldn't even laugh it was so bad br br don't waste your time this one is just downright bad br br 2 10 br br oh and here's some interesting trivia for youÂthis film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci fi film alien hunter which was far superior to this piece of crap
<START> i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted br br however i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she is the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and casting br br a must must watch movie for everyone
<START> sophmoric this film is but it is funny as all get out it shows the boys locker room mentality being played by the other side it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are but that's probably not news to most women 'cause just ask one they've heard 'em all before br br watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97 3 of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight and the other 2 7 can you ever really please them
<START> here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so i've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie hey everyone this is the director and the following is my carrie rip off scene enjoy ' but that's just a suggestion br br spoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh but that stuff only happens to other people tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine's day cards br br it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that's not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him br br on the positive side the killer's true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip off early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie blanks who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer's is that michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds this stuff is shameless br br at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out and the killer is' mask removal but then we see adam's nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he's been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember and even i wasn't scared and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing
<START> i thought this was a very good movie it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off i'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending that's why this made this move such a good movie it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy the same boy that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them it's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over i really enjoyed watching this movie and i still do now when it comes on i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead
<START> this a great disney flick it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach dennis quaid who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher but suffered a career ending injury but through series of events jimmy morris quaid gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster this is a great family film it is inspirational but doesn't pour it on too thick it's fun and entertaining adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids it is based upon a true story though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story quaid is sensational as the title character very convincing if you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy look no further 9 10
<START> i sought this film out because i'm a new frain fan and wanted to see more of his work first of all his irish accent is great he's got a keen ear for dialects it seems his acting was marvelous as usual james frain aside i thought the film was very well done it showed the conflict in northern ireland as the mess it really is both sides are guilty of grave injustices and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances br br also it is interesting to realise that not every man or woman that is supposedly fighting for his country is really doing just that for example when kenny james frain asks ginger ian hart why he does it ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer why because ginger isn't in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow protestants ginger is in it for the fun of killing he's full of blood lust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him in a struggle like this there are guys like liam john lynch who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families guys that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting there are guys like kenny that are born leaders full of charisma and they add fuel to the flames rather they mean to or not also kenny genuinely believes in the cause he believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future which is a bit odd 'cause his character seems too intelligent for it all but like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it 'til it's too late then there is ginger a pure psycho who isn't in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset some might argue however now in this film ginger has out lasted his worth and has become a very dangerous loose cannon br br everything comes to a boiling point and predictably the ending is a tragic one what makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict being american i can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about but i do know there has to be a better way br br all in all a well acted touching but troubling film
<START> this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot better br br the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together br br the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film 12 years after br br this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s
<START> it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didn't i read somewhere either don't care for opera don't care for wagner or don't care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagner's swan song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the text br br it's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagner's text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i can't think why syberberg couldn't splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music br br the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film
