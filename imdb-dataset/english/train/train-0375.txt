<START> when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color that's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don't just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
<START> very funny well crafted well acted meticulous attention to detail a real window into a specific time and place in history could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe interesting how passport to pimlico anticipates the berlin airlift a definite 10
<START> i saw this movie on thursdays night after having a really boring day i had no expectations those i had were rather negative being that the only movie i've ever watched jimmy in is the american version of taxi with queen latifah don't ask why but seriously this movie is so cute drew barrymore is always sweet but i almost fell in love with fallon's character why can't i meet a cute nerd like that movies like that are excellent simple sweet and necessary sunday on a thursdays i'm not even a sports fan but it's something about american movies with baseball that fascinates me probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in norway br br my first comment ever haha
<START> i can remember watching this for the first time when i was 9 years old i wanted to be one of the barbarian brothers this movie is still great one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short implying that the barbarian brothers where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly plus you have chases a cage fight a dragon and yes even a bar brawl br br yes the acting is bad so that's why it's not a ten also the story line has received a lot of criticism i think it is quite original not to many movies in it's genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue br br i definitely recommend this film
<START> with a cast list like this one i expected far better venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death the thing is she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none i left wondering why good movies can't be written for women it really was a disappointment
<START> yes this was pure unbelievable condescending babble we know that the french often have a skewed idea of the usa it's puritanism and views towards sex as an american hoosier who lives in france i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes and while some of these preconceived notions may be true not one element of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big where in the world would you find that a juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago but with no major gas station no tvs in the home no mcdonalds no kids a population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other the adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe have farms but don't harvest kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it and all with equal emotion the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy help i am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is go see it for the a to z primer on what to avoid gosh i hope i didn't ruin it for you
<START> at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films the guy is usually unpopular with girls in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years br br one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs they've done the gross out movies they've done the let's act like all americans have a mental age of 15 where will they go next br br this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it
<START> there are few uplifting things to say about this but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent we end up with movies like this br br lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take here she can only fail br br children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children although still pretty dumb the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes and as a family sports movie this is horrible the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car bash fest creating some tension if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part being able to leave the multiplex in your own car
<START> i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch's works for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical lynch elements having seen most of his works i naively thought i could predict lynch's next step i was dead wrong dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch still after my recovery from the first shock i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities cruelty brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality being emphasized by distorting it there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize for they are either disgusting or horrible however they are surrounding us so i take the courage to say dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces this is not a movie to enjoy though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange perverted sense of humor this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe with its simplicity morbidity and absurdity take it as it is you don't have to like it it just exists and finally if you're attentive enough you'll find elements typical to lynch as well i recommend it for tolerant people
<START> in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series monica geller phoebe buffay chandler bing ross geller joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green br br we discover that rachel a rich girl that is monica's friend from high school times left her fiancÃ© barry at the altar since she discovered she didn't love him she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father getting a new job as a waitress in central perk br br ross for the other hand discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode br br monica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife but in reality he was just deceiving her br br ps i just loooove joey's and chandler's haircuts in this first season
<START> that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version br br despite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story line br br however davis' mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute br br and it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses davis' mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era br br novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis' almost through the the whole movie davis' mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth novak's vulnerability was excellent davis' realism was monumental br br imdb votes concur
<START> i wish that '70s show would come back on television it was the greatest show ever they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing but i wish it would come back and make more episodes please come back the show was absolutely hilarious you couldn't laugh without seeing an episode there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when hyde and jackie were going out with each other those were the best episodes that '70s show is the best it will be and always will be the best show ever it was really sad when the show ended they should make new episodes
<START> although it's an r rated movie i really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager br br why because there's no real plot no character development no funny jokes br br the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks pretty nice ones i might add to feast your eyes on br br i really can't understand why this movie has the american pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them br br my suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks but you're too shy to rent buy an erotic movie br br gave it 1 10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2 10 for the nice chicks
<START> i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again
<START> to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century br br a river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand point great landscapes redford acting well br br unfortunately the story is bad if there is a story at all br br i felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrow minded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour fun all there is is fly fishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his father br br the end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very beginning br br definitely not a must see 3 10 br br
<START> there are movies and there are films movies are more often than not merely cinematic candy whereas films are true works of art fraulein doktor is certainly well placed in the latter as most viewers i was highly impressed with the battle scenes but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland all the while in the throes of morphine addiction die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto alone desolate and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a spy's lot in life only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can and those who have seen it can again perhaps again and again enjoy this exceptional motion picture
<START> i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g it's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice particularly the triangle between cruella le pelt and cruella's faithful valet alonso glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is cured of her fur loving ways she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loving ella all in all i will go see it again in theaters i found myself enjoying it so much
<START> this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
<START> two old men sitting on a park bench i don t really have a problem with this scene only problem is that it s not a scene it s the entire movie br br yup movies don t get anymore low concept than this they also don t get anymore boring than this either but there s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion who s also black let me see now a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine well i guess it s possible though unlikely but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930s br br stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with i m not rappaport is that it s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema it s based on a stage play and it shows walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
<START> christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam br br too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by charlton heston carroll o'connor shirley jones mike connors and shelley winters were excelent 3 of 10
