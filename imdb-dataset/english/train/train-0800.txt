<START> a man wakes from a nightmare about bats he and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon he seems to hear a strange noise and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket he wants to go on a tour of a cave which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon she relents they go on the tour but leave the group to make out she falls down a slope where she is disturbed by insects he follows her he hears the strange noise again and seems to know a bat is approaching one does and gets in her hair he fights it off her and it attacks him biting his forehead br br they get out of the cave but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people he becomes angry when this happens he's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out his wife worries about rabies and he starts a pasteur treatment for that but reacts violently to the injection br br and then some people are killed we see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person it seems it is not just in his mind whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite br br while the title seems inappropriate the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person not a very good movie but i liked the variety of the desert cave and ski slope locations and some of the weirder scenes i didn't think this was as bad as other people do and i didn't think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either i rated that one a 5 10
<START> this u s soap opera 'knots landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug smuggling not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast i've seen better actors on a cereal box from the mid to late '90's repeats of 'knots' stunk up u k gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously though since then re runs have been few and far between let's hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of 'knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune later used as the title music for the i t v sitcom 'the upper hand' great legacy that eh
<START> kurosawa fresh into color losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on tokyo's slums kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his antithesis that is to say i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work while ikiru while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while stray dog depicted the slums and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa pictures br br be warned this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by
<START> i had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of 2004's worst films back to back this morning first the incoherent cgi driven emptiness of the chronicles of riddick and then the embarrassing vanity project known as greendale one cost multimillions and the other cost pennies but they're both bad really really bad br br up front i should state i'm not the world's biggest neil young fan but he has contributed his share of classic tunes from buffalo springfield whose best recordings were young compositions to rust never sleeps harvest and mirror ball the man has penned some really great songs sadly there are no great songs in greendale and precious few good ones and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic greendale is best left forgotten buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to young's bank account
<START> on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good it's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the exorcist when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective but in omen 4 it stunk br br delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a therapist rather then a priest could help she does not look scary or devilish rather she looks sulky and moody br br this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked but it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies as a made for tv movie special br br on so many levels it lets down it's cheap looking the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama the characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them i recently re watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas and it has dated appalling br br if your thinking of watching this then i would suggest that you don't watch one of the others or watch the exorcist or watch the good son just don't waste your time on this drivel
<START> this is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 and in so many ways it reminds me of the later film a yank at oxford both films concern a conceited blow hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blow hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances x bushman and in a supporting role is jack pickford always remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clichÃ©s are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing br br in my opinion for a better silent college film try harold lloyd's the freshman it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in westpoint and the smart set among others and if you've seen one of these films you've seen them all well made but certainly not original and because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films br br 4 25 08 i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 talk about over rated there are dozens and dozens of better films how this film got to be 1 is anyone's guess
<START> oh my from the box description i thought it would be la crazy like 2 days in the valley or hugo pool ulrich seidl must be a very strong man most after directing this would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder i confess to only watching the first half hour for now reading all the comments here i have a lot to look forward to professional reviews often mention the swedish film songs from the second floor as a parallel but that's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism what hath the marshall plan and the eu wrought seeing this in a theater with anyone i know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than i got through on dvd there's a more annoying creature in the universe than jar jar binks the hitchhiker from hell whatever happens to her it isn't enough soulless suburbia that i thought only existed in arizona and florida thrives in lower austria oh no i thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in new york and san francisco and here they are in suburban shopping malls was it mahatma gandhi or jawaharlal nehru who said when asked about western civilization 'why that might be a nice idea' if the world were truly like this film bring on that black hole we're ready
<START> where to start the film started out pretty well but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by br br the actors gave an average performance in this movie however i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film br br as the film dragged on and take my word for it it dragged on it just got more and more far fetched br br spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert just when i thought the film could not get any worse towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was once the lead role disposes of vinny jones he becomes the new killer br br in closing this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie
<START> i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among coals during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been a franchise release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you won't be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book same title it'll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have
<START> i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least that's my opinion i am not sure it's a movie about drug abuse rather it's a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something marginal again it's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think it's one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture i e something they've grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time they feel like i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and what's even more boring when you can start predicting behavior not because you're psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side it's a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out people's behavior it's a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic math describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right
<START> an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track soul survivors is the latest entry in the who's dead and who's alive genre of horror films two teenaged couples sean and cassie and matt and annabel prepare to go off to different colleges but before they part until thanksgiving break they attend one last fling at a rave type party in some burnt out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel eliza dushku a k a faith the other vampire slayer motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie the generic melissa sagemiller for reasons that are never explained and before long the quartet leave the party driving away in their suv they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river sean is killed or is he and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt she was driving when she's not being haunted by sean's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys much unexplained incoherence follows as cassie's mental state degenerates further until we reach the predictable conclusion so who is dead and who is alive after ninety minutes of this purgatory who actually cares
<START> a beautiful movie especially if you like horses wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau a story of courage compassion and loyalty that transcends generations the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training br br i will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highly a good ''family nite'' movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi occupation of hungary the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady a hauntingly beautiful film
<START> this movie was packed pull of endless surprises just when you thought it couldn't get worse they added more joints and more pink fuzzy lined vans with raunchy sex scenes as you can guess i was a victim of the original version we were tricked into watching it thinking it was supervan the host box which promised lasars jail breaks and much more who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun
<START> not only is it a disgustingly made low budget bad acted movie but the plot itself is just stupid br br a mystic man that eats women and by the looks not virgin ones br br ridiculous if youÂ´ve got nothing better to do like sleeping you should watch this yeah right
<START> worst movie of all time wow whoa now you cannot be serious br br maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you i live in oregon so i got to enjoy the beautifully filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than average score br br or maybe it's all about what expectations you have having read the book ages ago and thinking to myself goodness no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting quirky weird book especially 20 years later when mores morays can't put in the accent mark online have changed i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again br br sissy was exquisitely cast and i don't care what you all say i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix's and john hurt's performances i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray and those real folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted stilted a bit stage ey always a bit on gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book imho
<START> the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i've put the spoiler warning up because i'm unsure if i'm giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then we're up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house we're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some 105 year old woman lived there there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den an old fashioned straight razor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks br br some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money the husband murders the body guard a co worker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant br br what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family starved to death or just concealed who is mr hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels he's never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen and why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated br br this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldn't redeem this muddled incoherent mess
<START> this movie is so aggrivating the main character looks like he's 35 and i've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor br br also some of the worst dialogue i've heard in 3 years lets go find a small animal to torture br br ugh i can't even continue don't watch this pile of garbage it was made in 8 days br br the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures br br 2 out of 10 unwatchable
<START> i can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot holes this wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch even the action was boring a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children br br what a shame that sci fi this bad can still be made after we've had bladerunner minority report or to a lesser extent dark city by the same director this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list truly awful
<START> i first saw this film when i was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy although my memory of the film was a little hazy i was in no way disappointed by what i saw the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone but this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike with a floating island a mad general a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down i would recommend this film to any one
<START> i have spent the last week watching john cassavetes films starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending on 'opening night' i am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films from the first minute to the last in 'opening night' i was completely and utterly absorbed i've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of gena rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the tenderness the originality the characters the deft little moments for me is truly sublime i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed you'll be rescuing your copy of this film instead
