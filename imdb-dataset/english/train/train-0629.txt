<START> written on the wind directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956 is like all of sirk's mid 50's films pure melodrama yet it is engrossing richly developed melodrama and sirk's trademark lurid colour expressionism throbbing barely repressed emotions symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave br br the film opens brilliantly with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world br br robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley kids kyle and marylee he drinks and sleeps around with women she drinks and sleeps around with men they both are worth millions thanks to the hadley oil business hunky yet poor mitch wayne rock hudson is kyle's lifelong friend and marylee's dream lover enter into this sordid mess lucy moore lauren bacall a slim attractive young woman who falls under kyle's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening mitch loves her too but kyle wins her they quickly marry and kyle stops drinking but fate seems to be written on the wind and it is not long before a conniving marylee who will have mitch marriage or no marriage a secretly smitten mitch the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows br br malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar she steals every scene she is in stack is almost just as good amping up the melodrama while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two yet it is in keeping with the characters they play br br so what's all this melodrama really about it well a lot of things stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear for one thing sirk surrounds stack with phallic symbols throughout the film note his tiny little gun the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol kyle's seeming inability to conceive children stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex made worse by his father's preference for hudson his sister's desire for hudson and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town buying cheap corn liquor like a bum br br it's about impossible dreams and having to let go of them the river where kyle marylee and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film symbolising kyle and especially marylee's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth in an excellent melodramatic scene perfectly pulled off by malone marylee's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child with voice over of mitch telling marylee that she will always be his girl this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood who hasn't at some point lived on a treasured memory who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have and hudson's last line of the film yes he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes only close ups recollects on how far we've come from the river marylee amazing
<START> 1 i am not weapon expert but even i can see difference between u s army riffles in wwi and wwii in movie we can see privates armed with m1 garand invented in year 1932 not authentic 1903 springfield aka silent death who privates use until wwii difference m1 can load 1 5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate m1 was semi automatic springfield requires reloading after every shot little difference 2 german army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 year too especially helmets german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top we cannot see even one in movie and if we make little additional search in archives how much truthful is this true story i am surprised how much truthful can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation
<START> jack black is an annoying character this is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds do i have to write eight more lines ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black this movie is a pg 13 version of an indie film i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture this movie explores mexican culture deeply i just choke on its cultural rudeness jack black is just so rude a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture as it were mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy such as myself could seek i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here br br i think imdb changed my review has anyone else had his review changed as well just a question
<START> this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control it's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots however what i found hard to take about the film was that although anja schÃ¼te was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are this whole lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is come on sex is a nice past time between consenting adults another thing i found odd was that neither beart nor schÃ¼te have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least
<START> the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichÃ©d suspense mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing these stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear so what we're left with is how good is the acting how smart are the setups and bad guys how well crafted is the main plot etc etc so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes eva longoria first time i've seen her on screen brings some satisfactory support the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit but it deserves slack worth a viewing if you like the genre
<START> this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws br br the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david's second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba hayward is at her best in this film her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here she is ever the seductress but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her br br raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet as a child when i first saw the film massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like the robe and the greatest story ever told along with perhaps 100 other films too the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film henry king a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon holed himself into any one genre pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david's own deep struggle with his faith in god the path tread in this film could have been very hokey but king keeps it real and interesting all the way plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god just as david himself is struggling with the same from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction david is not satisfied with nathan's answer to paraphrase that no one can understand the will of god this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself br br finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms this is one of his best performances br br i don't see this movie on television much anymore but when i do i never fail to watch it i think it still holds up very well today
<START> how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k i'll never know gymkata is a ridiculous action movie filled or is that empty with paper thin plots dumb characters and preposterous situations but take it from me if you enjoy watching poor yet goofy movies you will enjoy gymkata a great deal br br the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents at least i think they were government agents to become a spy you see his dad was another quasi government agent who has gone missing competing in this game called eloquently the game so the gymnast played blandly by kurt thomas trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad br br sounds promising doesn't it okay so it doesn't but still that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie they can be found in the movie's strange details like the gymnast's mysterious asian girlfriend who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie then all of a sudden begins to talk and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break the game 's non existent rules whenever he so pleases and of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the village of the crazies evidently that's the place's real name nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there br br but where this movie really shines is the action scenes since our protagonist is a gymnast the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses it has to be seen to be believed br br one interesting thing of note a lot i'd say about half the cast dies from being shot with an arrow interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie if these were indeed effects my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds more likely this was the film's way of not paying extras nevertheless gymkata deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing br br
<START> i saw this movie about 5 years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i didn't believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i couldn't have been more wrong br br what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you'd think in a 90 minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it's just horrible it's not so bad it's good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never come br br have you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed play br br you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity don't please don't trust me i'm doing you a favor there are 2 types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it
<START> i'm a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind
<START> andy lau stars in another cop undercover tale daniel wu plays nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang lau the movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces we then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near nick and to his cronies and the cops and 45 minutes in i shut off the movie and put on the news well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as i've seen in a long time its not bad as such its just you really don't care i mean i really didn't care at all i actually started to do something else completely forgetting i had on a subtitled movie on thats how much i didn't care i wish i could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me its not even something i could sleep to its just something to ignore come on the box called it the chinese scarface what after he was dead this is one to avoid
<START> new york city houses one man above all others the possibly immortal dr anton mordrid mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival kabal chained up so that he may not enslave the human race well wouldn't you know it a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free and begins collecting elements including platinum and uranium for his alchemy experiments with the help of a police woman named sam can mordrid defeat his evil brother dr mordrid comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection i had not heard of it which is a bit odd given that i'm a big fan of jeffrey combs mordrid and the film isn't that old but now it's mine and i can enjoy it again and again the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style richard band provides the music which doesn't differ much from all his other scores and brian thompson plays the evil kabal we even have animated dinosaur bones what more do you want of course the cheese factor is high i felt much of the film was a rip off of the dr strange comics and the blue pantsuit was silly and plot holes are everywhere i could list at least five but why bother and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle combs has never been a strong actor so he fits right in with the cheese these aren't complaints full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack laced grape nuts i'm guilty i loved this film br br if you're not a full moon fan or a jeffrey combs fan you may want to look elsewhere but if you like the early 1990s style of movie making and haircuts you'll eat this up stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level i did i wish there was a mordrid ii but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything is gingerdead man 3 really necessary passed on this one
<START> john carpenter's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters br br this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror picture br br even more unusual is the non existence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that br br halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance's career a true classic
<START> who ever came up with story is one sick person i rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together and we know a couple of the actors from class besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night i had freaky nightmares i kept thinking oh my god if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys units you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units i would watch that over and over call it hard or soft or something stupid like that i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks
<START> the mother is a weird low budget movie touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter and lust and passion in the third age br br the characters are awful may is a disgusting old lady and i believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her she confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter she cheated her husband twice with an intellectual she steals the beloved man of her daughter not to protect her from a guy without moral that does not love her but just because she feel horny with him she is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way destroying her daughter delusions paula her daughter is a fragile loser who accepts her life the way it is her brother bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife who insists in having her shop a terrible business indeed darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody even himself br br the acting and direction are excellent the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise i liked this movie but i recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences my vote is seven br br title brazil recomeÃ§ar re start
<START> when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel york's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed york's portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any way her expression voice or movement br br to top it all off danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible pino does not qualify to play as ricky he's small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky br br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching a e biography of lucy and desi read the book from lucille ball herself or pbs' american masters finding lucy if you want to see a docudrama before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing
<START> the story has been told before a deadly disease is spreading around but the extra in this film is peter weller his interpretation of muller on the run is real he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child this person could be working next to you
<START> the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them the only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late 70s it looks like it was totally made by amateurs it's trash but i loved it i have to admit i am a fan of 70s trash hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100 br br 2
<START> sorry guys i've already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie i don't like to write nasty reviews or criticise other people's opinions but i think it's only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie this is not a good movie i really like movies and i'll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through if you really are incredibly tempted watch the trailer that's the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer after that there are no surprises just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time i love michael vartan in alias and would hate to criticise him but i think it's my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this
<START> gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenster trilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the creme de la creme german movie directors of our time br br roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of time dilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite different br br the movie does not bring solutions not even part solutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy f ex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displaced br br since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change e g scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart shaped birthmark under their right shoulder blade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind
<START> it's depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches kicks and incredible stunts to be fair he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown but with 'rush hour 3' where he takes a back seat to chris tucker of all people and then there's 'kung fu panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement br br it's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arses in his younger fitter chris tucker free days br br enter 'police story' jackie chan plays kar kui a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial he faces resistance from both the unco operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both br br but on the other hand who cares we don't watch jackie chan films for the story we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is br br and on that level 'police story' doesn't disappoint at all there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant high voltage chandelier seriously if this sort of thing happened more often no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes br br there is also comedy much of which involves kar kui inadvertently upsetting may maggie cheung his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle but it works so i'm not complaining br br the acting isn't too subtle either indeed i'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story' at all director jackie chan yeah he does that too clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning br br so 'police story' is a blast as is the case with most of his films the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition i mean when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella a whole new wow factor is added to the action
