<START> well i was a teenager when i saw the movie the songs were a huge hit but the elite class skipped govinda movies back then coz watching govinda and karishma aka karizma movies were not the in thing for that 'class' but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90's through out and most of them were successful today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered there was a long que of people and the riot they created when the a aa e uo uo o song came on screen the dresses of govinda and karishma were complimentary to each other the worst dressing duo of that time well karisma in the late 90's transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the same but back then it all blended it was all good everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then there was no looking back for this jodi as it went on n on making those indian carry on series hated by a few but loved by the masses br br if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on tv i don't think you will regret it but remember its the worst at its best br br still i watch those movies when i get time coz i cant stop laughing so i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable i recommend it to all movie lovers
<START> when i first read hamlet i couldn't help but think of the ending of outrageous fortune where bette midler puts down the play because of how indecisive he is and says give me romeo any day five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not seemed like overkill to me but upon further reading i grew to really appreciate the play i've seen the olivier and gibson movie versions and part of the nicol williamson version and all of them take their model from olivier the melancholy dane olivier at least did it without being self indulgent about it but gibson and from what i saw williamson looked like they went to the look ma i'm acting i'm acting school br br now here comes kenneth branagh's version which is breathtaking from start to finish it finished 2 on my top ten of 1996 behind the english patient and ahead of lone star jerry maguire fargo secrets lies everyone says i love you flirting with disaster big night and looking for richard and it's the best hamlet and maybe the best shakespeare put to film obviously branagh's talents as a filmmaker for making the full length version in 70mm print and not losing our interest for four hours is great but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role this was my favorite performance of the year by far branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing hamlet as a normal regular human being and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way and unlike olivier who depended mostly on his voice branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that hamlet goes through but since he plays him as normal none of it seems like scenery chewing br br the rest of the cast is top notch as well i didn't even mind jack lemmon though i agree he was the weakest member of the cast the most surprising turn came from charlton heston i've always found him stiff as a board but he's quite commanding as the player king the other big surprise was billy crystal i thought i'd find him all wrong as the 1st gravedigger but he was his usual funny self while being in character all in all a glorious film
<START> garson kanin wrote and directed this look at modern day las vegas and the gap between generations his first directorial effort since the 1940s david janssen is somewhat miscast as a big shot casino owner who reunites with his son robert drivas who looks disconcertingly like an older jason bateman janssen approaches every scene the same way defensively with a chip on his shoulder playing this role cool and laid back is asking too much from janssen who barks at everyone like a grouchy put upon husband he even chews out don rickles and makes him cry his son a ne'er do well in search of his own identity makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas give them another ten years and his disapproval of dad's lifestyle causes friction brenda vaccaro is cute as a self conscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition unfortunately where it's at doesn't have much else going for it other than the now dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids some quick t a shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high stakes world of gambling most of which has been covered by now ad nauseum from
<START> presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland along with her standard singing moments the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here i really recommend this film for everyone judy is breathtaking in this role
<START> i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen
<START> quite unimpressive the 'twists' are all pretty predictable if you've seen any movies within the last ten years and the few somewhat interesting parts wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision are few and lack much punch since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained br br spoilers sorta br br the acting is decent enough the story simply isn't very interesting the whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff not kidding br br the surgery scene is initially tense a bit discomforting but then becomes utterly banal br br not horrible but not memorable terrence howard's least interesting role to date so far as i've seen br br kind of boring overall
<START> it makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from hollywood because oftentimes in hollywood it's all just a popularity contest it also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content yet this film is overrated and overblown eddie murphy looks just ridiculous no way do jeniffer hudson and beyonce knowles give the oscar rated performance so many have raved over before the film was even out i can't even believe that condon is being set up to be nominated for a directing oscar when all he did was put together an album glitz does not replace a nothing storyline a bunch of songs does not a movie make
<START> the wonderful z channel in los angeles showed this pia zadora film about six months or so after butterfly i had such high hopes for the actress and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film br br again it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers jacqueline susann ripped into him she hated his way of writing women irwin shaw's work caught on with many women and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books even more so which is why this work smelt harold robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences pia zadora acting in one of robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire the supporting cast was not a help either br br oooooh this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later it looks even worse i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress although john waters casting her in hairspray was a spark although she has a nice singing voice br br hey pia wherever you are hairspray may go on tour join the show you may be the biggest comeback story yet br br i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do
<START> freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5 dream child i hope i got the number correctly there's been so many and this one is one of the best especially for the cameos by rosanne barr then arnold tom arnold johnny depp who did the very first nightmare in 84 alice cooper singer you will see freddy as a tormented child a teenager who loves pain and as a family guy creepy the effects are very funny and creative the cast also includes lisa zane billy's sister breckin meyer road trip yaphet kotto alien live and let die and amanda donahue father knows best i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d well the ending i love 3d movies i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 i wasn't even born yet the second wave was in 1983 i like all the freddy movies this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s along with jason voorhees chucky micheal myers and leather face can you imagine a film with all of them i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike that freddy is such a cut up 8 out of 10
<START> from the first time i saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography i thought this guy this friend of the 'scwarz' must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in br br not 5 feet tall not that it's his fault br br at any rating i turned on the movie one cool night in tucson out on the second story deck with a good cigar and let it roll at that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so i needed a good diversion but as bad as the movie was i totally enjoyed it with a bottle of merlot too i might admit br br truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good it's not that it 'tries too hard' to be cool or that 'it's so close' to hitting the mark for an action film it's frantic and then truly clueless then frantic again it's the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene wow i never felt safer in my life warm and happy too i was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase due to less production in the summer months anywho br br the direction was 'uninspired' the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or re choreographed and tightened up the sound was off the delivery didn't hit you it just kept on going the other way the 'locals' of that village that they were in the town rather were 'off cue' they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even 'stare' into the camera lens like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer br br i feel bad because 'columbu' i just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in america as well as for his own countrymen br br however baretta's island is very lethargic and unbelievable even still i like it a lot my now x wife hates it but i love it br br the funny thing is i am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies i like or even 'love' all in all i like franco so there it is br br as a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to video b movies or 'bad' movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out 'the big sweat' 1991 with robert z' dar you know the big guy from 'tango cash' 'the big sweat' a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be 'on crutches' and at the end of 'the big sweat' i think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits good fun br br but all in all not as good as baretta's island' i gave it a '1' and an overall rating of 'awful' for awful good b' movie i'm waiting for the sequel maybe like 'baretta's revenge on montazuma' franco takes a mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co or 'baretta's powder war' where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene splice and create a hybrid super bug insect that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on he could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature right
<START> pathetic is the word bad acting pathetic script cheezy dialog and hip hop music fashion what the hell was up with that the directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made if someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing it may of had a chance bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly br br the absolute best thing about this movie was stacey dash the asian chick wasn't too bad neither these too gals carried the whole movie if it weren't for them i would have destroyed my copy of this movie br br if any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to don't waste your time you'll only regret it later
<START> the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his character's name is 'che' and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not 'that' che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america so clichÃ© other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who we are 'introduced' to them all in the beginning a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the 'special' visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films and the black character as greek chorus strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened
<START> the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet the movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress bertille noÃ«l bruneau tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox br br part nature documentary and part fairy tale the film focuses on l'infant the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting possibly france though the exact location is never mentioned over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call lily once again and so it goes on days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal and so on br br i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film making contained in that movie luc jacquet is a hugely talented and indeed rare film maker and i was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife this was delivered in spades but here jacquet has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'march' a fictional story br br the child and the fox and the story is simple a young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world without the hint of an adult in sight brilliant so she strikes up a friendship with a fox br br with a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of i'd say six and up or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon not a 31 year old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant wanted and the like but me being the newbie london critic i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child now i have a few problems with this film as a 31 year old lad and loyal lover of all things cinematic i loved the wildlife and landscape photography it's visually stunning the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed as good as you will find on any of attenborough's efforts as an impressionable short attention spanning eight year old i loved about the first half hour then i lost interest it's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending as a 31 year old male i was a little frightened in places wuss br br so it's not a child's film it's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down is it a good family film depends it's educational maybe and the film carries a message it's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer it's hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film it's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks give it a try unsure well i'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then paul heath http www thehollywoodnews com july 2008
<START> the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work as the original poem was is the context setting with the old mariner himself is fine clear and without pretense the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time period of the setting and of the work itself carrying the audience into the period with a still yet moving accompaniment using excellent still movement strategies only well conquered by the pre mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through often irrelevant cuts from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline the voice intonation and vitality of redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear strife and pain in addition the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself of the author's rendition of the ancient mariner's sad and spooky tale this is a must for any love of classic poetry the sea a tall tale that almost rings true and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture who does not understand the meaning of an albatross or the concept of water water everywhere and not a drop to drink a truly fine experience thank you mr dasilva for bringing this to life for us never to be forgotten
<START> i like films that don't provide the typical happy ending and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie alice marano danes and her best friend darlene beckinsale are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether or which of the girls was involved and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind magnanimous wife yon who is also an attorney i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison as another commenter has suggested as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal where this film grabs me however is its ending alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned and we the viewers realize that they are both innocent any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me and this well acted drama is certainly deserving
<START> i couldn't help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon a massively more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea this could have been a great film the acting is from some of the actors alright from others it's downright horrible br br that aside the idea is great and the format is great the story is pretty good as well though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind br br nevermind that though right it is a horror movie after all br br i really want to see this remade i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be br br however and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget and the fx really hurt the film overall br br great movie if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx br br whoever wrote it should keep going though great idea here
<START> no need to recap the plot since others have done so already br br it's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film raised as we are with the slam bang sensurround of today's cineplex experience against that background a movie like ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet i think there are several worthwhile reasons why br br most importantly the film unfolds poetically as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills trees clouds etc providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology driven cinema where rapid fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it additionally the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening this amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience but perhaps most unsettling the movie is sometimes eerily quiet not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to thus the burden of the story is shared between the film maker and the viewer the former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative while the latter must think about those visuals since they're not going to be explained br br none of this is intended to belittle today's film making it's simply to point out that a movie like machaty's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today i don't claim either to be any better or worse however i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's movie going experience where such 'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring br br the film itself is no masterpiece though at times it reaches artistic heights as in the beautifully composed beer garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below the slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life nature and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed these are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you but instead given half a chance accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine tingling variety of a jaws br br on the other hand the film is sometimes heavy handed as when machaty piles on the imagery particularly in the final ode to labor sequence it's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love lorn hero and people in general a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema still its presence here is rather tediously over done br br anyhow i've got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy lamarr in the buff but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a peek a boo romp in the woods
<START> a bit slow somehow like a sofia coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities
<START> an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration he meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public e g in a museum golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing he also meets the main girl lise bouvier leslie caron who is engaged to his best friend he can't help his feelings for this girl even after he finds out who she is engaged to filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance this is a very good musical film it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence i e the american in paris ballet but there is a good happy ending it won the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design best music scoring of a musical picture best writing story and screenplay and best picture and it was nominated for best director for vincente minnelli and best film editing it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy and it was nominated for best director for vincente millenni liza's father gene kelly was number 66 on the 100 movie stars and he was number 15 on 100 years 100 stars men i got rhythm was number 32 on 100 years 100 songs the film was number 9 on 100 years of musicals it was number 39 on 100 years 100 passions it was number 68 on 100 years 100 movies and it was number 58 on the 100 greatest musicals very good
<START> found this flick in a videostore it cost 2 to buy the whole movie stinks really bad the so called colonel who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world then the story leaves the colonel which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning a now two terrifyingly eighties looking guys take over in what must have been some sort of story i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind because the movie is so bad it's real fun to watch zero budget trash with actors not deserving that name go check it out
